Verses:
Jenny, Jenny, woo, Jenny, Jenny
Hey Misty, your mind's racing round
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
you don't own
C'mon, c'mon
I don't see
A part of me
In the tea
Hey boys and free 

Chorus:
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Anything you want, yeah
Are you worried how I feel good yeah
'Cause I'm with you now now hey hey yeah
So alone, yeah
