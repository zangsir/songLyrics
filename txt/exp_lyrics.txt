My love is easy
Tell me bout yours and then
Tell me you need me
Carry me home again
It's been a mystery
Most of the time
Stranded on the big top
Throw me a line

I wanna love you like it ain't no secret
Like I'm not ashamed to show
Nor would I ever, oh never never
Oh never let you go
I'll never let you go



11.
That it weighs you down
So all you have is time
Don't turn away
We have both seen darker days
And there's always a light that shines

Do you feel like all your hopes are a long way gone
Does it seem like every road only takes you down
Do they shut you out
Don't be afraid of what they say
Throw back your head and cry


12.
Out of the broken down peoples
And we built the new languages
Out of courtesy and velocity
Somebody got to have propulsion
Push the envelope


13.
Talks a bit, he likes to sit
Watches people come in and smiles
Somehow we're part of him
We nod and chat a while 



14.
I love you like a new adiction,
you kiss me once and then go missing,
so long, you've been gone all along,

With your happiness and satisfaction,
distorted by the big attraction,
I cut you down and set you free,
I pull the darkness over me.


15.
Some other place
We might not of bin here
Standin' face to face

I just wanna tell ya
Made up my mind
You know I can't help the way I feel inside


16.
When you're invisible, it's easy
But you're not it, baby,
Just ain't enough
If you want to be strong enough
But I know for sure
And I find
So I adore
And I can say
Why do you do
I love you too 


17.
Cleveland rocks, Cleveland rocks
Crooks disguised
An avalanche babe
Frenetic amnesic
In all noir

18.
Are you there?
Whoa-o whoa-o-whoa-oa
Your love is real
Baby what I feel
I think so


19.
Think happy thoughts
D'you
One wrong
And wanting
So much for me
