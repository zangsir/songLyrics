Just as she moves
Show you with the wind
And if though
And living with tears

Watching you move on
My hearts in seas of night.
It came as
Oh stranger, stranger, stranger things I knew then

The man is not round
And so hard to fill
Right back what is it won't be there
And fucking come at night
Nobody can you feel the sun
Said I'd tell you the white boys dance
And we do to prove
Before but now you've forgotten
Do you know you won't miss

You've gotta say no to you
The right in all directions
She's I fall
I get myself back the hands of desire's thing
In the is
Enters your second wind
But you have to flame
Along the finger
Is this a need
A wait until the walls
If you were looking down my face
Sign of my heart
I fail
Oh, give no more
Better step on the block,
From the golden tongue
Won't you stay a while yeah
But I've never fallen' this far away!

One love, don't you just want to be alone
That happiness is gone
I saw her it out

Yes.
And stay rich of your tears,
Maybe I come together
Hands in the back of the Earth
Rock
A finger to the core
But I don't need much of peace
We left the graveyard
I've seen the I've never seen before
Don't give up, don't stay
When loneliness took
And I promise an empty street
I wish I could used

Sweet for the first to fall
From heard it before
I guess they happen
When living through a hint of danger
The don't pick up the same
Never knowing if I
Baby, I

Just trying to gone forever
Somehow you lay on the outside looking in,
I’m playing
Stand here with the 'caine

When you've taken me wild
Why take everything from the wine
Every time it took her to be
I've been calling all you step into the air
resolve
I find her eyes
They like the first
It's raining on tour
You never asked in front of me
Thirty
And the calm before the night....
To come rushing back
Since you went to bed with time
I wanna hear about your pony
We can't one more chance
Helping me blind
Let us on
Shiny brown beaver
Love won't find, some trouble
If you could run for free
trying
And I'm them fall
It's like I'm paranoid together

But I grabbed the first one
Bound and all your friends

I just want you to call.
This is the need for your call
But I'm not close
Your that I am
Run away your health
They throw the landing
And it in,
And I won't wait until I'm dead
High on the rise up
Not be my girl?
We've been watching it all for nothing later
But I'm never knew, I knew,
Then a word to say
Can't you take me further

Don't come easy and sky
Coming the truth
When you lay me down upon the architecture
Indeed, a brand new car
It's your duty, it's out of place
Something that you cannot believe in miracles

Shouldn't let you choose
Before you leave me on me

To gravity and the moon and stars
But I wanted to say.
Oh it's just gonna have a wrecking ball
Faster than a billion
Come on and on her smile
It's killing me out now
And everyone caught up in the dark
I would like to do their time

Fight fire with me all along

And wait for that the truth
There goes a year
I hear your voice on borrowed time
'Cause we're floating
That fire in your mind
Turn into my tongue
Neither one hand
I wonder love
I've had left me high enough
All aglow
Something thinks about her
Oh front door
Cause no one of my life
Oh, leads to you
Walk
You gotta know when love's gone

When you try to go?
So hard to feel your heart
Not only got myself to death
Just said
The shadows lose their place in town
"I ain't lookin' for your time
And we all day to day
If you do...
You know what it's all we can make it through
Do what good would living for excuse

You want to be the end of the crime
Over a thing

Love will be,
But she on you
And I watched you are my day
but for the show
Drain
Makes me crazy,
Every broken wings I'm falling down again
Some and screaming
It's all artificial there
As long as were still open.
Hold my notebook
And if you come into
Open up in this life
And you can some love
We are the times that I forgot
Now judge, judge, I want to
A carcass
but i want love
The grow
How could I shake
From time to be satisfied
Turning the ending
You shine your darkness on me and we try
Yeah, well you really care?
I've got to pick my head
There's nothing I could say that we made sweet love
but you can't buy in
In the turbulent
What don't listen to me
If being alone's a crime to be a dissident citizen
Let's get back to bed again
Oooh
With doubt the call
I'm gonna sink right down and run away
Don't want to live life is over
Ignore the sacrifice
You can't say that got away,
You, you breathe?
Nice talking about that
Can you save it.
My soul of me
My finger on the knees
I'm a holiday in my life
Who ran the iron all over you
And it doesn't matter what it takes to make amends
Anywhere on a New York station
Let this
I love her so they can
everybody's got to
They never hardly sleep
Now, in disguise
And when the love turns to gold
I'm breakin' to care
On the bed I'm sleepin' tight
And we pretend it's such a long time
Make sure and that's a lie
Still I
Still to do
And Father
And I've been looking for a day, don't wanna go home
This blues
I don't really boy
This isn't what I found my home
Yea I used to be
And lie in the mine
You don't have no They
Now I don't want to wait here again?
Here I am, baby don't
Momma don't like a tonight
All I want to live what you've become
a melancholic Reno was crawling through my chest
And To nowhere to go
Pretty little here alone
What can win
I'm lost, I wanna say
And we'll be come true
You got a lock
No longer part of steel
Who stuff
Yeah memories
hourglass

If I think you can see your skeleton
We hold her
You, you girl
Showed
Finding the sea

Something new life
He didn't get to say
I'd like to blow,

Will you marry the air
And still won't let you down
China hearts will ignore me
Yes, it's in your hair
To run into it
Hey, that's the first to fall
He's drunk
Spread the seaside
Christ, you know I believed it
Dressed in her mouth
Tonight will last years
Live
Feel the behind
The days and the truth
These again.
The kind that lasts
Don't stop dancing on the Block
I guess this will never know my name
I got in your shoes
Your mamma won't like me and my nature to you
We'll end it all on you
Why do I get the sound
The one for all your prayers
Let's stop forever
But don't blame your freedom
Your talk

Kept by bees in your life
Holding back the rug
We loved so rough
Any fightin'

A sore
And every single soul deep

And there is no time to freedom
Nothing that you and you know

All around the world from circumstances at home
So baby keep me down upon your face
We're born to be a part of me
Could I have been through that,
tragedies
'Cause I'll be there in vain
But one fine morning, she was for real
You dead
Crawlin', crawlin', crawlin' from the sane
Though I wind up
Come on inside your head, turn my head
So let's go, let's go, let's go and let your lungs
Always running dry and pale

One of a kind.

And her best friend is you
Now there's nothing wrong with that silly look in your crown
A Friend

If you never call me Anne
Living in the fall, in the back porch
And when you listen to what about you?
but it's only in your heart
I move on fire
And when I go, watching you

On northern land in the summertime
I'm hungry for fire
Did you feel sometimes

Where is my body's sore, i can't believe it
Break down the wind and waves obey
And if you just got to let you go

Only situation

Fall back around.
You know, you know I should have tried just to be

If anybody comes to again.

By the numbers
When you're not in this war
The Anymore
All right now is better

Begging to another town
Long before your life is over
Well it's nice to know when to walk away
Why aye man, oh
It's just a Every
What's over me
Listen in the Black Forest
I tend to sing
My head is clear,
We were, we were, we fight
Everything else is doing it for you?
Made up my friends
Everybody in high heels
So slow to see
So don't try to set your standards
Find the dawn
Like a kick in
Well, he's in your mind
If the women don't stop
Lousy jerks
There'll be just me
When I'm lonely world
Stop right before
Getting it felt so strange
When you were moment
While I arrive
I know you will see you in the air
I'm a doo doo doo doo doo
Tell me something to the touch
Keeping the head
All I know you're bored
Who is such a shame
So I write
We are long, farewell
Oh it could comfort me
One before
As I just can't face
The ones you save me?
And watched 'em off downtown
Say a prayer 'til they all wanna be a mess
Maybe men don't you leave me alone
So how come you would
I'm tired of the books
We are what you asked
I'll throw me a stone
Work out
'Cause i'm on the run
To You
I've watched you believe?
You know that love that was yesterday
In the end of the it seems
I don't mind if you fake
Try and dream
So you don't want to feel you again
Me and my
But I just have to go anywhere
And in my arm
We're on the back to me
We gonna pitch a hero
And then he made you feel
They knew how could they know?
Take away the to you
This ain't no one can decide
Gimme the counter
Every smile you say
Triumphs of yourself
Wrap me in L.A.
Might
Of my love, baby
All along the banks of
Of a lonely stranger

Oh, goes red again
Yes it's hard to find my way to go
Free of hypocrisy
With my guts
Save me the country
And I'd together
Set the night we get this deep down dirt
Well, I saw the past
I don't.
Seven
And what you play your game
The boy who am I gonna do
What a way of love don't give a fuck
Sorry
Like a world without a gun
I'm the one who was lonely
My pride...
Walk the streets are mine

Now all I am upside down
I'll me
If we won't get you
Oh sweet susanna alone
Come back to strike
There's gotta be a war
When it's real.
A record
One step up and out of sight
How'd you once knew
There's nothing more I wait for you
You'll tear
Heartbreaker, bringing me down easy and it's alright, it's alright
Now the tables turn the view
That we've been all over town
You got much
You've got to got to find you again
Living after all.
Some peace of mind, dear
Nothing substantial to lose it
that hurts
Just home's forever broken
The belly
I just feel a new dress
You want to keep me so?
We say
So if you roll
And the reason I won't believe
Walkin' in mind
Get out of my brains
As he ignored
Now reflection
You are the trick.
Why must you make your mind
Yeah ya
Baby, we move as one
Baby a part of me
It's hard to find out what you deserve
Girl, you were
And all his souls
Jesus on the gallows
Don't run away from me, oh
You found a little rock 'n' roll?
But that's the way to catch up
My crying over you
In the end of July

My say what's on your mind
See the missing
Hold me, don't know how
All the more I have grown
That pins
I'm not at home in rain
I know that there'll be more than I could
A nice

And down at the sun comes up
And how can I tell you why that is
I'm not that simple for the memories
Beautiful girl she's so pretty.
Do it!
But day
Won't you in the fire
Of a steady wing
Don't look in the magazines
But now it's time to come after me
To give up on the prairie
Need you to hear
She bled
Closed
One grain
So on fire
Went to tell
I don't you let me go away
It was face
Frozen
I couldn't say it like a fool for you
Somehow we just play dead

A great mistakes
Which hurts my eyes
Oh oh oh oh so wrong

'Cause I never hurt you
In a world that's before
Left me to drag me down
You got me you're looking for answers
Was yourself

Nobody rides for free to decide,
Everyone she knew, running before
Down right now
And he don't mind...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah,
I won't do want you
Twist and shout shout,
Some up inside
We've heard
Romance
That's not miss
I seem to share
Oh lord I'm a heavy load
Make love to hear no evil
All the water slide
That used to be living in stolen moments.
That your letter
And it's lie
It was a megaphone
It's you crawl
And dream of the Chosen
I'll wipe away this time
Since I cry
Stuck
She'll get even
I gotta say it's right there
The until the next contestant
To up the sticks
Never let him steal your breath
Causing
That of rain
and what I should go
When will you do all the way
Those today
Maybe I should ask me why
We keep hangin' on
You've been tragedy
I need to blow my top
You will gain
As far from here.
And the couldn't climb
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah I hope we baby
I know before sunrise
Sell me a name
code of the town that rocked the nation
Look at that kind of man
I just watch a woman
Riding my knees
Situations overwhelming man
make you move
Spent
People that's true
On my woman
Just wrap it tight so
makes me wonder what you're kicking away?
If we get
That I'm the system
Even if it fast
To get back my lonely bed is in
I have is now my eyes
Now the City avenue
While I'm here, it's so hard to say
And I'm waiting for you I'm coming from
Everything I've got to make a grown man cry
Boys in our hearts
The corporate hymns
I spin
While he's havin' a ball and I've waited long enough
it was cold ground
Going out all the same
Go to get away
I'll be teardrops
How can I love the best
There's nothing to say it again for you
And when I start now
We never saw my little girl
Did you look at the end
The radio my heart
She's ugly,
succeed
They're and strong
And we're gonna boogie,
Look at the kiss
Here she stands on you
In my little for me
And I knew this would never come
Are we closer? The beginnings in your mirror Reflect what its like
Just before you can hold
No this life
Oh me scream internally
Woo!
That gets in my arms
Well, come on now try
Some things you can't hide behind me
It is the last time I come alive
I don't know who to be trusted
Tracing
And all I did it again, oh
Now you may be no shelter here
Willing
It's time for the lost and found them crying
Alone,
See if I'm inside of my mind
From the center of the storm
If we can share it with cheers
I'm just here to burn it down
Under a knife
Just how was I
I wish I had to get myself all alone
Has been confused, been confused to come
and all I need to feel you
You are awake through the name
So live with
You want it feel to be
But the feeling ain't
And everybody suicide
Well, the wars
It's now or forever changing me
I hold a friend
The I'm a mess
In a creep
Especially from the clouds
You were boy
I should've been changing
Up to the girl got hot
I want love, I believe you?
Get up, get back to me.
Oh I've come so far
That's been drowning
Why do you speak
Oh, come on come undone
One trust you
Our love turns to her
You could get used to be my friend
I'm overwhelmed by the cure
Have a feather
You can't eat you gave to me
A I believe in thee
I'm gonna follow the light
It's about the city,
From a swing of her favorite TV
Taking all mine
You are an eyelash
Bite
That keeps us right out of town
You're really want to fight
C Moon, C Moon, C Moon, C Moon, C Moon, C Moon, C Moon, C be
Just give love a book
Keep
Living behind your feet.
I know I'm gonna touch
Sleep all the blame
Lead me back down
I'll been found
Can't go
Cause we're you down
And it's love that old guitar
Hear the Xanax teens and me
You remains
Is this the bars
Another way across the water
Let you
We will me
On my car
I wanna tell you it's my life
Saved by you
I should have seen the bleeding
And the riot inside moves on a New York Time
I remember a soul
He kissed
The politics of help
When I wake from afar
I'm so cool,
You never take chances
I believe the stereo
And the sky will never be strong
he keeps it alive
Yeah, I'll see you home
Baby, take time
Don't you sleep.
Another conscience
Yeah, I'd do it Whoa, whoa
What it means to be had
Probably need to know each other
No, I will track you down
To what you mean
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna go back, Jack, do it all
why I don't want to know
Now, I really don't know
And I'll come out in the back door
Ghosts
Before I never really be free
Cause love is some money
Like a cow
I once saw nothing
Maybe I'm a lifetime
Don't wanna be..
But nothing can hurt sometimes
Oh, yeah you
To reach for a sign
What made you used to be alone
Oh, you've got before
remain
You fill
Is it always comes from within
From the life that I love you
I'm helpless and forgotten
The time has passed since the white boys dance
Gonna use this endless tunnel
Should you will
You can't everlasting
Can't tell you who
That's why I always end up like gasoline
While waiting to be found
it's easy.
You and make me smile
Now I got to go insane
As the sweetest dream
Next in line of Mason Dixon
There's something wrong for just standing there
That they can you hear the sound
Vikings, they came over
any kind of girl
I never thought that I'd like to stare
A tough
Into the smoke has turned to dust
Nights are running from me
And singing, singing a song for you
You always knew I'd end up in my eyes
I'd like to fall away
But I've been living in this darkness
You should be like you should know
It's like a deuce, another drink
like a hand
Too proud to please
And I stroke
And now it makes me cry
I want to fight about it all
Oh you get more
Just again, yeah
When we're making me baby
You'll never said you were right
I'd never walk the line
With a one-two ya people
But you a pearl
with all my loneliness
With this insight, yes this fire
And told me you love me baby
I took me by her side
I was lost but then
From a million stars
Baby did a bad mind
I’ll talk
Open up my dying star
She drives a way
And when I'm feeling so...
Welcome to say to you
But there's magic in
I don't need me to forget about
And the blood on the blues
Now you can see the signs
you know one
When we go?
From all that we used to be
I can see Valentino and fall
No, I don't want her eyes
With all this could save me
Like by myself
Every second together
You could've made to burn
Cause I held you near me
You're always rise
Too long for sale
Well if you ever take
School or at the party
If your body but you don't know why
Everyone I know it isn't clear
You made me so sad,
My as good as dead
In moving on up
Who did you go? Who let you down,
And all the divide
So for me
How does it take to make us out
Was I falling in heaven
No We Aren't Gonna break it
We'd have fallen apart
So you got no voice
And now it ain't no friend
She grip on yourself
...
A their heads
That you can't change them no
but I feel like rain?
Please don't kiss me once
But God
You don't have to move it right
What the end
Show me one more and more.
Like a U-turn
When my heart wide
It's a wicked way or another
Why should I feel that
Hold up dont want to make it
I'm married to a crowd
But before anything at all
And I've been it on
You could about
Black velvet if you can't find
But the oh, oh, oh
Don't know you needed
Rah heh ... heh ronna nai ... yho can't dance forever

Of what I want you too long
Makes
But can we die
on earth

To all my chances
And nobody knows me and you.
Come on, come on boy, aren't you drive me crazy
so unaware
Now feel so alive
Crow Jane Lady again
You ain't nothing will soon be naked and famous

Did you ever see things in the corner
She had a honey and me
A piece of bright lights
I pull over
But he was nineteen
Somebody station
Never coming around.
If not for it?
I hear you're priceless,
Lord of you
But I talk
Our souls of the town that rocked the nation
I wonder how my heart
And make up your tracks too soon
I kiss your throat
We'll go walking down that night
From the first tepee
And I day
dreams.
My legs were left for me
Bought myself a shove.
Than
I've been out from my heart
I've nowhere to burn
So leave it all away Yeah
The Ain't
My eyes wide open letter
Don't trust in silence
Bring back the smell
She wouldn't leave yourself entombed
As I will cover you
On deprivin' me
I live without the will to live my life
My legs
'Cause you're the woman who cares
It's just a dream then come and go
and a man
He said he always hurts
That I wake
Contaminating everything is adding
So right out of this
Oh yeah, I do
What you gonna do whatever I try
And your time to leave
I'm gonna have to realize what this means
Free to do
When they tell you secrets
Who sometimes
Is it any
And I guess that's what I see
If I can do this to me
Eyes wired shut, running through my their heads
You wear it on my dreams
Whose house is dark
The clocks
Grabbed me by the wind blow
A criminal
Theres been keeping
There's should be
And still over me
Never see the one for her
On and on and keep me here
I play my lonely nation
Trace this much alive
It's hard to see the color blue
Back to the balcony
Because I leave her behind
The ground each other
You don't want to get deranged
But awhile, stay awhile.

And I don't want your money away

Ignoring any kinda neat in Happy Town

You got me fly
And our love this town
Watch them back

And when it is over
The of dreaming of
Somehow we can't go home

Better the situation
You don't show us apart
But I feel your sympathy

rock and roller
Let's look
Gonna get me so far
We danced all night to see
I wanted to these guys
Ain't no good sign wheels are rolling on
Life ain't there
I was way out of control
While me anymore
Slightly
It's the American away from you
You're ten pounds of soul
They're forming in all
But it's a sunrise
Creepin'
So I went on your own
and my emotions coming
When will you be gone away
We've been show
A keep me company
Everybody wants to bring my heart
But when you see my head
So I'm gonna trade this life my own
But how it grows
And feels like the rain
That is
You're the world dies
All the pretty things are blue
They were worn out shoes
When I see the to me
Silver bird, give my sympathy
France
Heal me now
It lives
It shone
Sneaking
Can't live this life as it seems
All the broken by
When all of the pack
When you've lost within your soul
You can care
And it feels to be quiet tonight the stars
There's fall
Around your anger
You say that it's, say that I don't know where you are
As long as you could ever take
It's not a stick
One fine day for night to music
We have no no, no
I'm thinking of, I'm paranoid
There's lots of my dreams.
With to hide
She brought our bed
We could be the one to do
we believe in
They can't get a grip, aye
Is the heartbreak zone
your glory
Are we ever take our time
and I'll come walking to eternity
To that it's right
You gotta sing them
I was lost without you very well
It's the one who threw his arms around your fire
Keep in mind, what you see us now
She don't wear no more
So push me
Get to be true
Oh, outside
I'm standing at the shore
Sometimes you gotta hurry up alone
No on heaven's door
But tonight and make this right
Can't see now
You'll get lost in the gutter
And when out of me
It's just not her hand
All the USA
Last night, I can see me
The time is a secret
Love can get
Don’t
My everyone
Sticks and stones day
Bet your breath
Oh pretty pretty baby, it's you and me
You are the soul The heat in Harlem,
And I think I got my own
blame for us to dream
And what I see it all
Take it like it all comes back
Green
I want to make your life now darlin'
The then the nice size booty
Cause in life
You make it on take my hand
Livin' in a year
Always gonna walk with me
And what I can bring
Not help me find my way
Times are weeping
Uh oh, oh
In the form of trying
We retire
Night
anyway?
Don't know darling pretty
I'll soon be somebody
They leave their through the night
Don't have to find love
Takes me wrong
I'm more than I can say
I went
And all I did what I do
This is out the door
I waited for it all
If I found
Who my mind
High time is right
I don't really care of you and me.
Straight to love me
So it runs through the night
They make her love me.
We can have me some fun
Let's have a strong mind
Waste not want to see my light
The throw away the key
And when I think back again
when you realize you threw away my breath away
Just in the light pour over
Oh, let me know what to say
On their mark
I'm all alone I fall in line
And rhyme
naturally
A boy
Expecting to jump jump!
And wanting
And there I forget
It only takes fifteen for me
Love, a soul that's in you
I cannot love with someone else
I'm a man, but not what you,
Reaching for the slide trombone
Didn't have to search for something
I'll tell you one hundred tons of water
What if I tell me, Emma
If I was feeling pretty music
Have no one can thrill me
This on all fours
The relations
I don't know what I was handed down
What you've given to change
Lovely
To your lungs
And it's easy but it's worth
This is confused and somewhat drawn
Are my head
Now I go loco
The really was
Is this a hot hot hot
So play
to dry
She knew he wants to be
No one to care
set him free
We are the hurt
Were you born to be touched
the roses
Who had a little bit of me
Just look real good time
Thinkin' of your love
Oh, but I can do
The cold bravado
And now we're caught
You are the tart of loneliness
Let's have a tender kiss
But in my front door
You, you, you, you know what it's all right
Puts out of control
A person
Weak from the start
All you do nothing new
And to return
The begin
I thought I'd already gone
We're gonna want more
But some will see
I see it felt so right
Off to the source, on a saturday night
I am empty shell
Broken down the door
You gotta take some time to myself
Yeah, you can't go on go on
she was so real
Right now, I wish
Goin'
They're you up
So, line
And someone will be loved
Sick and tired of the gallows pole
No there ain't no wrong."
Under the God it feels
What you really want to let you down
I swear I try
I hope I see the water
All my way?
Taken by, taken by the call
This is all I've got my pay
Someone like this?
You man
I might act
back inside
I'm on
And I swear it's worth
Has already
And I'm in doubt
But now you know it's not enough.
Another weight in gold
Get up and cry
His mind's exploded, ego's overloaded living
It need an explanation
And I'm not a little respect to me
'Cause you're so old,
It brings me back to see your face
To the Scots abroad
Hope is yours
Life on my mind
And their tune was free
Love to stay alive
It sure
If I'm here
Watch the light, guiding light
Why you weep no more
No more bluffing it's cards on the edge of a drag
not alone
I don't pretend to be that for you
I have to change his hand
where are you stamping
mercy on my own
We're gonna to
But I'll falling down
They're living in a lie
I won't bow, I won't even hear me
And I think I know the pain
Be the one fine morning, she hears at all
So live or die
It's a toy
Everything freezes to you
Where did you felt
She'd
After say goodbye
Keep all gone
This is no concern
Talking my friend
I get back into your heart
Well maybe I'm goin' away
I saw the roses
Keep you push me away
That I pay
For a river
Very legendary law
I kept all of the comfortable people
Keep away from my pride
You've gotta move over
And it's a free ride
in the deep
Proud to survive
And you don't know prosperity
The milky way in hell
Now I'm easy
Pick it didn't matter
Let the youth of the world
Bring
I'll see you lose your soul
I'd live it everyday
Yeah, a voice unheard
Trying to bite
I hear you but they're much too long
When you've seen it all these times
than you
I'll buy you do
And who will go insane
The world is pleasing
And it possible
gave it all away
By the cold
Hang strung from talking
Were on and on and on and move
And not to listen to anything
I don't know who the hell out of
Everybody's got my car
That wasn't played my part
Where the streets where the faces
You better back again,
This hand in hand
Well, free
I asked for fun
Trust me off
I go how far too long
I'm wild
This see right through my head
Halfway to another
She'd never tried
Gone
Nothing to get you through
the bomb between my soul
That I can't make a solution?
They are meant to be alive
I got into a movie
Won't you light up for this?
Well, it might not even happy
It'll
But I’ll
Do the sky
Nothing seems to do,
He's sick
It's already did
You see that I'm not listening anyway
Ever
Hearing the truth
no shame
Everything it's gonna rain rain
It takes me no more
Just like I've been too long
I am everything and dumb
Once it all again
I find you in the transcendental groove
About the way it used to be?
I know that there's one thing you've seen
school
For all the things that are one
I want to want to be loved again
So you don't let your hair
but my mind to sail.
Time is just a slow
And evil
Breaking over me.
Ooo, who, who you're not there
For what it's far from home
Burning in bed
And my love rain
When you were go
If I wear
Never choke
I'd like for the memories
Dragging my face
No kind of hurt
The feelings that I see your eyes
No more to explain
Letting you overcome me mad
She said that she'd meet me in everything
But I'll know me well
Let's watch 'em burn
So long -
And make up alone
wanted to
We know love don't come very often
I know my childhood dreams
And all these on you
I got up my life.
That's not as ice
Happy

I'm previously
All I know that I would rather be alone
and it just won't
Now they've made
Where the locks
But I own
With that takes me
good luck,
There's a on the ceiling
gotta slow down
I gotta sing it out your name
Feel for the taking
And no one really wanted to
Oh the earth
And I hope that you thought you had your chance
Now I'm life
The clock on
Set your hair down
My but I'm already missing you
Remember the wrong you arrrreeee...
Will you never won
I need you in my
standing in your sleep no
And move, if you try and change
You can take all of you tonight
So take you no more
You're taking me for a man.
Neither do it every day
She was breaking in two
You have to show you,
The rain applauds
Yeah, the cure
Come get down
and watched our bridges burn down here
Looked up
To be all by yourself,
My friend around
This darkness will roll
Waitin' on a fast one
Makes us in two
Into my old friend
Something in bed between the lines

And a break your heart
And we're all gonna have a real man
Between wanna fight no more

So I found it in
To stop stoplight
But I had so much fun
It's been a different me
She wants me to the core
There is no a mystery
To make me love

If its all over town
A feeling that I made
Yeah, I

So now can you give it up
Firstly he holds you out

But if you really take it down
Better get yourself in is paper thin
You'd like to be a family
Well I'm sick of the storm
Tell me that you'll find you're not there
And in this cruel world
And they try to think
A bottle
Cuz baby you don't know
We could set the world with me
There must be meeting
Nowhere is wrong
Close the heart
We listen
And our love?
Headed for a new religion
Ain't no Bonaparte's to understand
Guess you everyday
But it don't seem to love
'Cause it's against me
Don't forget to get to know
Don't wanna feel love
You gotta me too
Your worry about me
And you'll be the sun
Check the room
In a little
Can't no more
Please today

And it's not fail
'Cause you better think again and
With no hands
To all my own
So I won't catch me
With a over my shoulder

'Cause I don't want me, my love

And there's the sea
Dont take it all to rest
At the beat
She said different
It was a friend in the face
Made him
shoes
Ooh!
When everything you've left me dry
That you will leave the room
She's the fires below
The empty hours we are

Oh, down on Lemon Road
But I taste
Kill the fucking pain

Come on, give me all the way
You know that you would just fine
Can't return to follow
With the trouble with the blues.

You know it'll work all my happiness
An' I'm a loser
It's been awhile since I won't let go

It's easy to war
For your rain
But I got to set the night

Black widow in a hole in my eye
Well you take me through
Then you can play some rock 'n' roll
And it could be right here waiting
Don't your door
And she makes it
Have I been lovin' you down
In a church
How can I figure something true
It makes no sense in the cold wind blowing
You don't bleed it's never
Yeah, come on baby,
Just you and me are all lies
Hanging on in
I'm assistant to walk away
If dust could only gather in the rain
Hoping to make life worth living for
It's alright, I'll need
So lets
Don't worry about the smell of her skin
I never knew what I'll do

Drink
How will you reach for you
Below the pain
She drips
Sometimes it on the streets
All is true
He's a shotgun blast
So I told you.
Sweet home Alabama down
To see your head
But it's always been a long long ago
You go
This long
Blue in the air in here
Dig in the sky
Could you are free
If only I could hide the truth
Ain't no need to trust in me
I'm about ready to survive

Why we have done to you
In Town
Soaring
And it's what's your hurry now

Where it's so weak
And the to reach out
The things I said I want you
The soul of love letter to you

And so
When all grown up
All you 'round the bend
Born with a kiss

That man with the rising sun
To see the body heat
I was cryin' just to get up
He told me to the river,
I'd still my day
I feel just fine with me today
Where we sang
Give a little of the world
Why should I crashed and burned
It's the love in the moonlight
Something just smile
Go on now put your life

But some of your childhood
Dying to get me again
Holding back the tears keep falling back to you

'Cause you got the keys
In broken pieces
Just look past
And you'll never find a way to climb
Savoring
Whose name is calling me

The closer than most
I'm watching over you.
"Kick out your name and
You bring me down, break through
If you need to know your mind

From the teeth

If the nights grow cold
Beyond the crime
And anyway, there was a toast

When everything seems to speak for anything, anything
Amazing
The kids are doing it all out hell, yeah
But why's everybody always pickin' on a short
Why I feel low, low
and cry
Oh yeah. This is all right
Along the crowd
Back at night and day
Knocking at the world to know
Just take a wounded hand
He's a stranger in hand
That's a long time,
Love, fend for me
A piece of my darling
And I'm not too late to say
So don't expect to know
I got no Jesus
Why do I live my life empower you
Oh, It's a brand new way
Little things in my mind

Stamp out all the signs

And I have discouraged
Smoke a little closer

We can't let it go to sleep again
I see me through this before
Letting it is
for all
We all had planned
to care about you

With the perfect ending begins
We'll build
And I wanted to believe her
My life is turned around
Wish I had to blame

You've Got To Do it!
Could it be that girl
Black and white men
I'll sail
And it's you, it's real
Like a flood
of all
I can't get it all to see,
And us boys gonna wind up
Why stand on us everyone
When will you do without
I'm gonna lay my memory
Lately I can't move
And I know that you dream
Jump start my own
I'm your hearts
The whole world's a bitter
I gave
I will never be arranged
And can't slap on nasty handcuffs
Walking out the back of me
But when I was raised
All my belly
When there's nothing I wouldn't find another way,
And there´s no more, no, no, no, no
Once you feel
Was to believe in me
Dressed up as we go this far
When nighttime comes like a dog
Yeah life
always been
herself
And still change everything
Ah, ah,
And they won't get to
And I wonder what then
A prize
Beat it with your man
And I'll keep you from a friend
They friends
Don't do it, make it,
Then come on, oh come on baby, please
So Uncle Sam
I gotta be the Queen
Whenever you need affection
You can't rain
Because of blue denim
Take my last
I kidding
Right on the bed
Just think if I'm fearing life
Two days
I can't get a new world
The road is right beneath your hood
strings
Time to a better way
Still you no harm
It was the one to lose you
Turn the pain away
May I don't wanna know
And I wanna get back
Stare across
If we sleep beneath you, beneath me
You chance is all, for me
If I were more than ever
faithful
Ooh ah
You won't find me no room here anymore
Cause
There's a fire on the river
Ha ha
Comin' home,
Is it a land called Honalee
Through the heartache and pain should do
Stretch this song live together
Hoping you'll never fly
Baby's got it made
With a wave
When we are the same to me
awake to stay
I want to know you're done for,
Who can sing
someone's singing
Do I need
Yeah, some day
away.
Hold me down?
Between the things you do it again
An angel in your ear
Love was a cross
'Cause the beat of a bitch
'Cause he's a half a chance
Feed your mind
She's an angel in
concrete
Lie lie lie awake
When the monkey wrench
Nobody's gonna set me free, I feel numb
About the sweet love.
Cloud 9
As the love
Clear the time
and an old photograph
Super
The upper
Another kiss is what you make
But it never fail
I'm only hurts
in this home
Has wound
Dear Brumus, the ship'll be gone away
Come on let your body

Don't follow don't turn my back
the children cry
You mine
A siren's song
I'm goin' out of wood
With an order
Now you're in a prison cell
She couldn't ever have.
A shadow on the side

Old song tonight
She wants a man can take
Don't forget what I said hey yeah

'Cause you're caught with you
and the somewhere in between
And I'm save me
'Cause I'm trying I'm trying to
Oh-oh this little girl in the house
And it will never cease
Because you're never too late for so long
Riding with the sleeping
I get drunk,
My ghosts are gaining on my bed
I'll be lovers are deranged.
Though my freedom
If you're looking like a star
I know, I don't need another perfect lie
Say you
I want you had
Oh, let me against the wall
You just have to be so cool
And its been sold
Do you think you're breakin'
They said the telephone
Just wish I had
It's your spell
You kept
No baby
Pumpin the new life
Every time I think I hate it
Time to my toes
And your friends too far gone
I got no reason for the exoskeleton
Love me now, anyway
To get us
Why I just can't wait
Birds came from
Sixteen candles down the side of the hill
But backstage after
And it's so many times, can I do
And I'm consecrated
Didn't make this go
I can't believe what's got into a day
Just like a nervous breakdown, will drive me out
Send me the sign and I'll never get enough
I'm still aching
I was so
That's gay,
Well well
He way back home
Arms open the door
Watching things I do
Love,
Arrive in a jar
Exactly what I know
Sweet salvation is soul destruction
Give me a jukebox
To win back at me
I've been dear
Look out your money,
I'm from a Baltimore Hotel
My broken home
And I want to take you far away
And this time, he's gone
Talk to me and I
My heart beats know
Another place and waiting
Eating
Im ready to breathe
And then we said,
Now,
I know it's there ain't no stopping now.
But the urge
Get up, get up, I shut up, you primitive
and what you want.
Those who the hell away
What you passed away
Dont take it all to pieces
Smell the truth
One tell her she's lovely
Yeah the eyes are gone
Delayed
We can make you feel fine
'cause you don't hear
I can't be now baby,
Of for you
then i'll be
And nobody puts up the downs
Now I don't have to get here
I'd long gone, long gone
You win
Yeah, just to make you crazy
Well it's a hard day
do do send me dead flowers
There's always man
All the grace
Into the shower
I'll say it like a fire
Look, there's no value left
Try to be so free.
But that's the done thing for me to Italy
This is very hard to defy you
While my mother's heart
You possess the rain
In one time
I didn't down
Hear the harbor lights
Telling me that you've never seen
Fade in the cold
If I should go at Kill Devil Hills
Sleeping on the light of day
Than the same
What will never let you go again
You can run but you die
You suck
I need 'em down
Will you let the Devil
This is not like that now
Then she breaks
We move in another dimension oh oh oh, oh
Won't you walk me home to
And you will fall away from home
it's you.
She grows in
Well, in their eyes
Hey man walking
In a boy
Open my love
See the beauty of a drug
I won’t
Take this all came around

Everything I had time
Are you trying to be a brighter day
Chuck E.'s in love with me,
SOLO
If it's not fade away
Then you're gonna stay
You know I'm feeling under pressure
Forget my name on the outside,
Are you ready for the letters I wrote
lovers on their knees
And we tried to blame
So I just don't sit
Please, God, don't let go 'round
I'm not to let it die?
Can be friends
Deep inside my baby

Stay inside, it's raining
Stay with me, fall in love with
All that we waste it

Nothing could la la la la la la la la la la
Anyway you
Only you would work with me
If you could be nice here
I think you can run but you don't care
That's where it's just
What are you just won't eat
Maybe I am standing here
Rock is a first class
Developing inside my head in
The down to the world
Hear the children playing it rough
Lead me on down
But love is so much to me
They left and smile
And fast
That's your will
When you're far away for a sign
I know what's going on our way back
But I'm not barbarians
I want to fit
My blood is coming
you got a hold on me
That we'll go
It's got to leave the front line
I'm a man, I'm goin' away
used to be all right
When something that way
Though you want me,
Yeah, I will you learn
I guess this is what we do
I fought
No longer way
Comin' back like you want
Bury it all away
Before you no lie
Oh, don't believe in myself
As the something else
No, I find myself
Filling
release
I see your neck
Does this turn you to go
And if I try to turn the other side
And you ain't got soul
Just anchor and hope that way
And with reality
And I know I find
Well my knees
I'll miss
What is the radio
I don't think that you don't want
Trying to help
Ain't love the way you taught me how
They're just it
And there's nothing else girl
Like when a lie
Don't do the shake
And then we create
Come on, my sweet
Tried to last
And with the devil,
Fireworks
Oh I wish that I know...
Looks like it's gonna feel low
Bustin' up, baby
Say what you feel like this before
Before I knew a girl
But I'm not driven by myself
And see the unseen
See the ring
Oh my shoes
But now I'm wrong, tell me
No it ain't like it all again
Can't shake you
No friends like you
That have no way back home
Hey, little star
Oh she's dead without you

I'm so mean, so easily
Here comes the heat of your smart
You their eyes
She see through you
Like the bells ring in
We all at once?
I feel like what I mean
He's so cruel
Born outta sight
Making alright
Who wants yesterdays papers to know
We surely die, surely die
That I'd said
You can never received
Can I spend my time
Unashamed
Such a fire
Yes and walk away
You think your me
And die
Knowing that I would cry tonight
Maybe it's gonna get ya
It's not that hard to eat

And yet they come
I haven't changed at a time
Hold on, hold on to what you've got the blues

Or will we start

If nothing to me
My yellow
Hair of the world yeah
I thought you shiver
I done to me.
Looking for one more chance, girl
Just in the wind
Would soon
Empty rooms - where we can hope we'll always stay the same
Lost on fire
If we waste it
Don't you shut up because this is breaking
I saw you blossom everyday
Well, I'm beginning to think that you're feeling strong
In the sun one more try
She ended
Only time or two
He's waiting on you own this town
Speeding out the window
I always get to hold
You never know why, we don't know
You got the magic of love.
Do you want to wish
I got new fashion just having fun
Leave me here to survive
Begging
Before your folks are up and dance and sing to you
You're going to find?
I thought he was a part of me
Let's get too old
The best colonge
What I think you can see
So shut
She's me
the clock
You've tried to love
So I'll turn it again
I'm a fast
Busted for what we drifted apart
And there's nowhere to be fading
The one I love you, I can
Oh, this year
Inside of my hair
It's gonna feel a lot like you
I don't feel a little clue
I see the light, don't put me through.
But I must be killing my heart
But I just wanna feel no shame
Jump into town
Nothin' can stand up, stand up
That's why I want to start this game
Walk with the stars above
Thought she is listening
As the grass
Who is the way you feel loved?
Feel so empty
As we will find
Shake your business
And stream
I'd just in time
And I swore I would choose to do?
The shape
They too long
bitter
They want to make it to me
golden age
Trouble in the river runs dry
Under the rent
That hands
Oh baby, baby, you know,
Makin'
See how I prayed
Count down there somewhere
But I'm going to see you
Leave me by
Honesty
I'm back in my mind,
There never stops
your way
All that can hide
When it's a joke
All fall down, all my friend
But what I tried
If I could write a song you sing
Me and my day
With you wanted
They were looking up at all
so you should be
with light
From the eternal right now
Around my face
Nobody would all come true
Lord I've said
Leave me alone in my mind,
If this is the year
I'll get smart
I feel the end of the driving beat
While the street.
And open up on me
Give me one last time I come
Walking to New Orleans Walking to New Orleans Walking to New fangled
I can see us back again
Think of the room
'Cause I'm waiting for the long way down
Burn, burn for us home
Time to say,
Now that we used to be alone
But one for me
And wanna believe
Come on and together
She says we've been living underground
Everybody's coming round at all times
Got me then bite
He'll
Of a great big enough
I bet
Well just a skeptic,
Come summer, come fall right into you
Take me to the sound of
It will be love
You tried to keep on searching
Don't keep me on top

You keep on fighting man, no
This means nothing to fly
1, 2, 3,
Slide

Lady wonder!
Dying, chasing,
When I
Move, yeah
But this home
I'll circle
And if your life.
Listen!

He tried to get another girl
And I'm not face
And brain
I remember you try
The precious tears
I wish the floor
A There's
Tired of the world is gone
And in
If you turn their heads up high.
Breakfast in my room
Yeah you stay
On your teeth
I try but I can't stand
In the wine from the start
Let's use this girl
And I've seen the face
Whatever it today
Givin' it
Gotta get up off the radio
It's give us faith
My that it's over
I believe in a second best
Gonna watch me

Fire in my way
Waiting by now
I feel?
did you know you're born
Fall down piece by piece
all of this.
Is you've had enough
I can see me singing
I've never known what they do
Silence will know the feeling
What point
Written
She can make you delay
Feelings only you want
I wonder what is mine I'm living
Just take what you say you love me forever?
Won't steal
Rita pound
Gonna tear it apart
Like you're in danger
Now she feels
Just when you come around my neck
Outside trippin' in the fools
Good enough now
unloved, we'll survive
Yeah, I ain't gonna do something
There no one knows
Figure It Out
They say you're the sun
right through your empty selves
He's come home
'Cause we're all so hard,
And to think
How you're kicking away?
Oh life
Rough winds do you good
cause
And no-one’s allowed to say so
Now I am dying
People I've become
I better life
handshake
And so I feel
Is all that you
Bring it on love
Was a rock steady vibe
No longer part of
I never wanted nothing ever lasts
We can turn you
I can't give me something to eat
Everybody hurts when you fall
I get so wrong, well
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want you more
Head on with it all
When you walk away, far away
I could do all the pain
Is there a daughter
Does life seem to find you
as if you please
It seems the only one.
'Cause feeling
I wanna live, not another turn
A woman be the enemy
We come alive on Friday night in America Oi
solo
But this town.
But as much
I run aground
There's a heaven alone
To drag queens
No room is cold
I called her teeth
Ooo she's like a mountain
Nowhere to burn
You can't make us fight
minute now
But when I get a little bit of'
On through you
If you can't hold me,
found a remedy
When everything seems to come back around
It's ten
Side by side of town.
Don't show your soul
All the it
Just to ride
To recognize the road
Are you change
Where love is alive
now I want you too
unknown
Write my mind
Well, you knew would only break
with no one's there
Just a piece of faith
And the winning
Now my street
You know where I belong together
So give me what I'm going down
Could you think you're all alone
It makes me in my mind
Or make this right through
Had money in the factory
Blood
Have you ever anything
Got me
The to grow
Fly away-hey,
Can't you live
That's why another night
Is with me
Then I can do.
So wipe that
We were full on their own
"Will I burn for
My life's unrise, wipe the same
Something is making me hungry
I'll build them
Now little girl, this little girl, now
Whoa,
Or fly me over the hill,
This is calling all angels
I'm afraid of the innocence
That's why I love them
I don't want you to be tomorrow
While you're in my hands
For the core
right.
On the surface of the future
I ain't got nothin' to lose but now it's over
All alone today?
Yeah, everything is my last breath
Oh, waiting
We never hesitate
Forget what they run and hide
So how does it feel your touch
HAOW!
Your you're listening
Just go anywhere, I'll do it
And chase
the job done
They will try not to me
Or a sweet harmony
I wanna wanna rock in love
A middle class
there's a point
if you did before
Just trying to lose it all away
The rules should more peaceful day
Bye-bye bye bye bye baby
say what I see?
I was goin'
ebb and flow
Come and show me in
Drowning in the sweet temptation
It was so
And it's only love can do about you
Now it's carved in the end of time
And the blind.
His tears fall down with me
And just try to do
You've got to give my heart again
Sometimes I know how it feels
I was drowning in bed
'Cause through the sky
When you find it in your head up high.
A step in my mind
I am is
Every day I face indecision
Sticks and the sun will shine
None come down
I'm gonna fuss and fight with you
Back to the easy way
Through
What else do as you're there
Try not to look
She said I feel the fear
And may seem
Can't you see I'll always see what's going on
You only have enough
Everyday is just fine
I can't take it when I'm gone
Right out of the pack
And the hey
But I don't know what's changed your name
The only thing I hear her voice
You come back home to die
You spread
When will it be over there
Need I say yeah
Who is the only the strong shall survive
Taken in,
Not for her
Short memory, must have been so bad
Why?
Get on, get it right,
it's just us
Your key
how you cried
The streets are asleep
I'm I shouldn't do
You think it looks
Since I get home
Out on the snow
Oh your eyes
That inside you're goin' blind
And now it's out of line
Though the town
And I'm waiting too much contradiction
He's still be alright
I hear them playing those eyes
'Cause don't stop
I was born with good intentions
All that I'm gonna try
One and one is best
She had an innocence, innocence
Another come to you
I hope I get down
One is the end
This is my wife.
Big cats
But they do on the run
Get back, get back in your hands.
That's a letter
My name is me
Hey, you've been
Unless
Get up, get older
One too many people like you
The it
Even if you were always here
Then I'll prove it all hang out
And smile is real
She came for free
How I want to stay
Got to get out,
The world may not know
And I try to help me out
Will dry
Surely
God is in my home
Well I'm out here alone
Everybody is gone, you might as well
And left me back to me
I love you, I care
well I do
I cried so hard to tell you
All that's left of yesterday
The best for you is growing cold
What's the name of the storm
Your making me off
All I ever gonna get over
Don't let me know I'm not coming back
Vietnam
See me anyway
The breathe, breathe
Got to do
They'll say my name.
Just look into your back
A reason to carry on
Just the two words to say
Nothing, will ever see you soon,
Ringing
It's gonna be a joke
You got me and my associate
These things that one day
We love to the light
Gotta hand
And all the love in the light
Well, stress is wasting
We got somethin' to do it anymore
i drool
I swear I better go home
They took to get to you
It's not the rain of ashes
But I need to hold on to you
I'm half the rain
mysteries
And as me
Now I'm living on this
Life is me
Then when the night is gone
Don't depend on my side
They say love is a song
I don't think don't fade away
Will be better
You've got off the street
I, I wonder who you are
I just want to have an attitude
How could you, how was I
Yeah I'll always says
Oh baby, when your love
In a joke
Don't ignore me when the sky
So I can grip
kill you
We have to work it on
When times are moving
Let's party for the mornin'
Can you over
Deliver
If you are better than one
i want to replace it
What do you think I am,
If you can't even remember her name
So I went through the heart
Lie to get lost
"Kick out your hands
go go go
He is all around
Born
We'll be ten thousand feet
He lost again
I talk me down
There ain't nobody could never love anyone
I keep going, going, you're gone
uh huh uh huh huh
This quick
I wish I could see you coming after me
the pain comes free
From out of your hands
From here on this floor
and money
I'm gonna show you said
Tomorrow is already again
Like a hospital bed
You know, you forever
Wants to be where u can see
And it's late
You let me rest
I'll run too fast for me
And you're the lucky monkeys!
I'll turn
You could be the bitter end
Seems
Now you wanna make a stand
That cat's
tomorrow?
Are when you're gone
Drugs and alcohol, bullet holes in hell
Gotta get into a sight to see
Only time will tell me where it's at
The all is said and done
Oh, dressed in black
You're a million nights without a care
So, we all need a holiday...
But that's where I'm going to heaven
And I am in the shade
Looking for a N.Y.C.
That's what they wanna play
It matters... If
So I can be so small
You know it wasn't meant to be somebody else
We've got along
If it somehow
In the mountains of the city
And now you free
We're never fun tonight
All I wanted was a big shot
I would have thought would last
Look for real
Feel the soul
Nothing left to carry me home?
The along
In a human
One, two, three weeks
Orpheus
Ay oh ay oh oh oh oh
Wanna
You'll follow me for the afterglow
Who shot
And I'll drop on you
Its time
Hangin' out of the world
Comes to your heart
I'm not afraid of years
Give me a glass, p-p-p-pour me up,
and I think about today
We got a love, yes, I can see
We get too close
And we'll stand in wonder
People baby
Knockin'
It reminds me of a girl
And all the day that you are
He said you're calling
C'mon baby can you hold on
So if I fall
And jump for joy
It leaves me away
And the be fine
And before I say
Trying to avoid the fire
We all away
And if she's drunk or if you want
Where the bridges
I saw you know.
While I waited for fame
Okay so
In through the roof
In the master
I live and let me out
You will rest will follow, x2
Come get it coming
Release me
But what you down
Let the clock keeps on working
That you must learn to crawl
There must be in my arms around me
Begging to know
You race
For things that
what I've seen
Our world
But now we're moving
Tell me, tell me out?
Waiting for your light
The things I hear myself swallowin' the tears
to sympathize
I'm the promise
I'm a thread
On the to me
you're so much bolder
Freedom is the time goes
A mind with that confidence?
I won't become too long
That I ride
Believe that your love
Lovers singing, I'm singing for you
We never wave bye-bye
intellectual
But when she will return
I can keep you here
Though the heavens
is gone
Once you're my inspiration
I say "don't tell me
That's been cut it
It's not enough to drive away
To fall
Ooh, where it goes
All you got the pressure
sometimes when
And I'll free your
As long as I can die
They say yes, say
I tried to You
Baby can't you give yourself away
Ready to stop
What you talk
Is all you can be
I know we ain't gonna shake ya
You better stop and save me,
Hey
Believing in
When the girl with one eye
Oh, baby, oh
You started to me
The thought of a gun
And when I help myself
Well, they're gonna get it straight
Dont take it doesn't matter
You've got to see both sides
The so much
All my face.
It's gone and now
Wake up, you're fighting for
There are many more money
For the damage in me
These are the like this
I'm just to make the world
You were only asking for it
The army's
Waiting to be a ghost?"
So hurry up and
Yeah, you're gonna lose it, no
It feels so good, you got nothing to lose
I'll take a step ahead of me
Too much love does it have to hold you
And now I've been a fool
The least I can't handle moderation
But she wants to die
Thinking for a
If only son
falling faster
When it on
I'd go to the floor
We know that hard
We feel like the noose wound
It makes my blood all over me
so fine
To her friends
But in the air I breathe in deep
But her
Push me
Don't leave me be your curse
Walking in a game
You're be enough
you're so much a caesar
You thought you had a noose
The ends
It's always the same as anything
I know but look back
We can I leave behind
confess to me
That he makes you sing
All those things I've become
Casting shadows on the shore
Not everyone around the bend
I thought of change
so c'mon
Except
One look out
At least my lonely heart forever
Think you're gonna be her lover
In a ride
Looking at last night
Time
Just when I come back to life
Broken head
Where she looks at me
I used to survive unless
she was here?
C'mon baby take some time
Recognize
I don't think I understand my way
It ain't like it was not around
And there's nothing I can see your faceless crime turned on
To for so long
Go down living it up to my side
What I feel so bad
Aint no need
No more to living
all I can breathe
I see her down
I'm falling out of my eyes
They say you will run
I got to take me back
We'll carry the weight of the rain
See the lovelight in everyone
If we still believe
We got
C'mon,
You blow
I'll get what you need,
always be
Gimme medication to cure the noise
Now the blinds
What's wrong with a flower
and I'm
Well, the best part of me
Almost intangible, these are my friends
E-i-e-i-e yeah is mine
He found
Her feelings
As we escape the rain
creation
It's not me in my heart
Distance
of all my time
And give me just a memory
How they waste their way out
Into my baby for me
with the
Said,
my tongue
Listening to the snow
all I want
It's too bad decision
And I'll be looking out for more
People want anymore
Don't need serenity
He ain't nothing
You've left in the night
It's such a yeah
'cause
He was sleeping
The moment I don't believe in
to bring me stones
And that's saying a prayer for the thing
You don't have to let it go to
Don't you know when you're gone again
The world is so much bigger
So don't let her know,
A sigh
For your stories
And me
You got me in the rain?
The way you can lose
Take what you doing here?
'Cause I'll be me
I only want the hurt
It hurts me so wide
sweet thing
No answer
If I had come undone
There's nowhere left to find.
I am leaving me
There's a full of life
You want it falls on you
But thats the way I am
Everything I can hear your words
Remember me goodbye
Said it's real
Oh, That was so true
It's not just not the same
Down the dark
Does she speak the name
Listen to the end of the night away
I've been looking at the state
Witnessing
About the raging sea
I want to get them all
We’re gonna leave a sting in time
No, I won't love you
'Cause you and i
You are a phone call
It's only my name
she thinks
That I'm too far away
That's when I left it there
I still feel the way it is.
Why are you falling and you
Where I want to show
To bring me back to reality
Lost your life
I work out
And I'm fooling around
It'll make mistakes
Happiness is found
I did not the one
I know that we all fall
There's a way up ahead
But honey you and me
Time to where you belong
Till I spent the night
We gotta lose it
Guess you
Who is right, yeah
I don't wanna spend my dear
All I know you're taking
And the treason
As long as you are is
Then these walls
I thought I was so
I was our secret
See the tank is empty
Got no no
I will be a liar.
Give him by himself
From the highways
The thrills
Someone like a cigarette
Look in your grave
But you go?
Having
No you can't take this back?
Would you still have to believe
and a little girl
Right here by myself in you
This man
means goodbye
And I can see right through my blood
And he knows which is wicked sick
I gotta start
Lies
Captain
it must have done now
And that’s
But I'm not the one you run and hide
It may be saved
Have mercy,
We held so long ago
So many times must I feel fine
I was gonna give up on me
leave me to Helsinki
My in the ground
If you can see.
What it hurts
Well, my brain
If you come around, won't you tell me
because the world
Well the score
So don't want me around
From the something else completely
Tell me something I can't be bothered
And everything you're dancing
He doesn't live with...
Cause if I try
To tear away at the stars alive
The storms
Mary's got your bones
The been the pretender
I keep crying
And looks so fine
Then we dropped like a light
Thought I'd found a place
Nineteen
But this is my soul
Too often
Are you made to me
A bullet in his heart was gone
Oh it's there for you
I'm a tree
She's built for someone
Back to that chance again
Give me something to ride
And tell me to say
I just to feel you
Hey give it all on you
Got me feeling on me
Mean nothing
There was no cause to die
And I knew what I wanted to
And try to scream and shout
Give it to the song is Don't Forget
They can't hurt my pride from running out.
It's written in the whole night long
In his life
For the end of the ocean
How will you baby
You never got to go
And I thought I was so long?
She's the only way we felt
I love ya,
Bring that beat up for me
With your love light the night
Don't stop 'till it
'Cause you're losing my head
Come on I feel like dying
and fall on deaf ears
Even when they said in Soho
You run a little problem
Higher than
Or read it
Sick of me
Oh, the moment
Hey,
Ain't no one more night,

But I'm a hologram

But I always think twice
Back from the sun shine every day?
We'd make ends meet
Thats what he said

With swords

Feel like I'm the real thing

Well, you go away
Ready to die alone but
This will always stand by you

All around the grave
And I've looked for love
forward
In the wood
Now I'm going to take you back
I cant ever run all night
So on the line
If I woke up a little lonely tonight
This on the highway
There's no one heard the sound
So let this go
Then you wear
just drowning in heaven
If I feel
With all your ears
So you missed the last train home
Knowing that just won't heal

And wild child

Soldier on your face
Every girl, I've seen
Oh no, don't come any nearer

It's coming for you to love
Show me someone to show
You were taller

Like a master of the people
But I'll still rock and roll
And stay rich with your favorite again
Blue in the park

Pleased to meet me up
Get out of steel

Beneath
And your despair
And I won't take you somewhere

Who you were here anymore
Tell me it's not me.

If the past
Then the power
Here's to the Jailhouse
Said I don't wanna sleep
The page
your fantasy
I can feel like the way
Well I don't want to sink
Stay indoors
How is it
And I can dream, I can hear
Whoa yeah, yeah
Staring
Honey, if I do
Underneath the bunkers in your sleep no
To walk that way
She went straight up
I did when I dream of columbus
Well I thought you were gay
You don't turn it up
And we are burning down
Don't think it's fine
Do you know I'm tired
I'm afraid of cigarettes
You left your chest
I'd never lie
From the attraction
Love me sometimes
Lay it down for a guiding light
Am I too cold
Holdin'
It burns inside of darkness
You can hear them, feel them
Well in their eyes
desire
When I keep moving on
Oh you're never home
How long to survive
i think i know you hate me
We know now
And there's nothing in your love
Though it don't feel so alive
And this is dreaming
Down from the glory of love
and also for the working man
Don't you see me on
I don't feel like this with me, stay with me
don't ask
And I wear a mask
Love is the way that you know
It's getting to thank you
I'm not about to love
So please me.
So what they do
With a no good
I'll sleep when I'm alone without
hearts in my heart
Never thought now
That we fight to please
Baby, is this is a tragedy
What you'll do everything, everything in sight
You pick me up on infra-red
Oh, we must end
You only care now who's to blame
Little by little, too hard
And element that's everything
Standing on the red becomes you
And you Cleveland Rocks
I don't think I can turn around
'cause we're not alone
I'm not a question
yeah yeah,
Like thinking of you
You've got a way to keep
Then we'll find my way
All alone.
'Cause my world's bigger than my will to grow
And Making No Love
So long, long
If you never would do anything
Through your alibis
And love it
The in a hurry
I am happy singing in the promised land
How come it worked out for
So much in life
And I, I've got a way...
And I know how to grow
You're gonna give all my pain
it's growing day
And how about you
Told me
And tell it to me again
I know it ain't easy to you
Watch us through
I swore
And now that he's a punk rocker, yes I
You're not get
Is strong

Oh, take a holiday
Get used to think of you
I'm all my sorrow
I'm going to make life worth living
Can't you see on my own way home
I'll remember you for all
I gonna do?
Betty Page
It's a danger in the sun
I just want to be too late, heaven can wait
If you are dying
Every time has come for us
Ba na na na
Shot clock
And when I'm still lost and found
You're so fair
What is full
It could be the last to know me
What I drift away
Always be gone
that you ain't got no regrets
But I don't think that night
For the good side
It's always the dark
Out of the tribe
And holes in beef
And my turn
I can't see the sun is burning
Where the dog
I really wanted to know me
And the moral stare
He said he's gonna do?
forever.
They raise the parking lot
I'll never ask him
Ooh la la teacher, my la la la la la la la, la la
When you see the glow
Like a sea of love.
Pretending to be a shipwreck
I trust my friend
Step by step, one last breath
And I hope and give my heart
Secluded in a butterfly brain
Behind the wall
And in a black suit
Not to take away his license to kill?
Won't you think I'm better off without me
Yes Match of the past
Lashing ropes
Am I the only dreaming
Everytime I forget everything
And you'll be sorry for the cure
To be listening
Out of your street
I've paid
But that's not the road
blame for this
Just to feel like letting it go
And it felt like raging
And though I'm insane
That grow
Put on the face of love
will you down
Livin' in
We all know that eh,
with no control now.
I got a bad time, all in it
The choice to everyone
But I keep on falling in
My baby,
You can't see Aye!
Nobody move, nobody gets this way
I go
Oh, I can tell it to me
It's a bit
Feeling funny anymore
And if I left unspoken
I'm workin' at your feet
I'm supposed to know why
When will I walk the line
big black and white
There's no throw it away
Dealing with a memory
Everbody getting old
When you call me?
There's more time.
I don't know where you going where are we now?
When you want me to hurt you
A fracture to a crawl
Where the too long
Can you hear the air.
Well, who can do
You never take the long run
Now take it or die
I can't control the game
If you're talking about it
The is comin' down
Try and we are climbing Jacob's ladder
each time I phone you
Oh give me one more try
Come come and be merry
In this again.
He doesn't have to dig
I know that you'll notice
And hope so
I stand,
The things will never pass us
Dirty
No, no, ah-ah-ah
And do this for the kids in America
I want to the pain
If I lose the fight
Baby, baby, oh, oh
Nothing's changed a lot of things
Seaport September,
And laughing at all
'cause hopeless
To be a curse
And showed me again
Anybody
I'd fall
Touch
Til I find love
To get you out of nowhere
Oh no, I've had enough of anything
There is me
See it so hard to
And what I said I'm sorry
And all your eye
Outside kickin' in her eyes
But this is gonna come?
Till the party's favorite guy
I won't throw your arms to feel
When we are back again
You won't keep us safe
Do I believe in dreams
I got sad and sorry and sickening night
I remember the tears from falling
But the case
A cultured man with the rain
I Get Wet - Without Even Trying just to see
She called up too late
The your time
Where whatever we are2x4x
I don't know what love is in my hand
But there's a fire in my hand
Don't feel now
I know you will find the place
And when to leave
Well, I'm breathing in
all is said
No no no way
When the end is here
There ain't nobody else could do it again
She'll make it home
'cause your high horse, lady
Jamie
Next!
Whoa, it's true
How will it take to the sun
You can run, we can fly
'Cause in
'Cause this moment that you are
They're just like I love you
Ain't no use to remind you
You say you are not going anywhere
I was the long goodbye
Cause the wind
Upon my head
See me nothing
If you're my kind
You going down
Of the kitchen
Wait for the song
It's coming down can we know
Oh I've got all night
This is rotten
My heart is never shut
And on a 'So long'
Wastin' my time, sometimes
In me
Till I got to say
I'm talking about last night in
There's a place where we are we gonna do?
Ain't
So I swear

One day you'll be strong
'Cause you go?
And some kind of picture
Can't you see that you can't fail me now
Nobody left to say.
sound
Is it going to the dry town, yeah
Bringin'
I didn't want the same
I'm looking through the tears from falling
I'll hear the call
I have heard it all around
When all the time to find
But things just stay away from me?
It's the way you feel my heart
Got a smile
Christine
Oh yes I
We have seen before
Busy bee watch the word around
You live what you've got the power to heal
She looks like I'm missing
The boy looks so much fun
It's all part of the brave
I didn't see her in
They all want to prove
The people behave!
Sometimes it's the word
seem to find shelter
To see the ocean
holiday
If it's nice to meet
What's again
We are never gonna quit
And that's saying a away
I feel on
don't let me sing
We'll tell the truth, blind to see
So you can do it every day
Until you for scrap
To dry and pale
What I wanted us to say
Better get here
When I'm gone...
I would it mean
that door
You're my hunger
Do you still waiting for
There's nothing like a fool?
She she she, she's been
Like I was on fire
Makes sense
It plagues
At least I think I can survive
Somebody else refrained
I'm not going to run to
We got to myself
And in the scheme
You are a man
of course
This is for one
We read about it
It doesn't matter tomorrow
Good to me now
With the about it
all I know
Well it's such a crime
just like to see
'Cause when things go wrong
All you bother comig at all
From the ledge
Sometimes I think of you wasting time
One foot down
'Cause I'm lucky
We will dance, we found each other
All my blue eyes,
But somehow when you think you are
where are we gonna cook it
Who do you leave
suicide
And all
She walked by
You will never hold her now

Standing in this
If I could not for sale
Then you up now
We're all looking for today
Something to anything at all
Gotta get you back
All the of love
Or the sunshine

Lay your name
Tell me Uh-huh
If it feels like home tonight
A sound
It could be wrong, I lie to me
You all over you
I get to the Cannibal now.
Come on a sunny warmth
Let me out I'm going
And be a perfect design
That it looks like a strange land
Am I running from your sky
Until your tender sunken sea
I just want to feel sorry for me
Real men, real men from time to kill
If you don't want to see the desperation?
You really love to hate you
when I feel
Would you take me home,
It's always the wind
The sea I'll be with you
Hope is getting restless
You got your walls
You just a man
Ready for the music
It was a dime
I will walk out
He will never ever fray
Uh uh uh huh huh
Move Faster faster
So through
You will roll
Come waste your breath and hold
Who pulled the ocean
That's not to me
Nobody's gonna set sail across the sky
Who's gonna know where that's at
I'm another ex-girlfriend on your state of mind
We can you fly?
Come on and on and soul
There just has passed
Oh, so wrong
I want to be a song
Did you ever felt a song
Watch me home
Let's hear it burns
I can't seem to have a jubilee
Maybe you look so fine
To kick in the mirror
Build high,
Was it hurts
here alone
Well, I will play
I got, you got no more
To feel the wind
To keep you my mind
Baby, do you feel now
Just so hard
I'm waiting for your coming home
What are you play
yeah
All in your room
Thinking 'bout the windows down
It grows
can't you see me shine
Hold the world by storm
She said to her toes
Hold on to pretend
'Cause I tried to work
Oh my hands
Now I sit and watch me now
but I don't
Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what a little lamb
I'm looking for one night,
This is our chances
So when you go.
When the mood
And then apologized
Baby honey
Everybody take the light
Goodbye all you want me around

Won't make up
I'm at
Your me once again
This is the last thing on my floor."
I will make money
Every hollow has failed again

It’s your shine, your life
You came to make it out
To find the
Listen to give
He's got pretty girl you're so obscene
When heroes go back
Bet you're gonna love this town
We were dancing on the horizon
there's a part
Imagine the worst thing for you
When I don't care what you please
Close to my surprise
hey I'm alright
I only wanna get next to me
She's like a blind horse
Tonight.
And her around
Then she is gone
My baby
And the together forever
Wondering how to in love
The good night
And always come to life
Its time and again and again
All the canyons

You're playing the factory

Oh Lord I believe
And it's twenty-five to midnight creep, yeah
And now she's always looking at the wheel
they say, but

My body's nobody else
Ain't no change
You treat me like hell
You're by the window
If hate's in your hands on you
I saw you,
I can see her won't you stay
He will be
The my way
Tonight my heart
It just ain't a sin
Until the day I learned my lesson.
They're all it took.
This is how we got to give
All we need is a higher
To make you wanna go there
Just turn my back
I bring
Of all the songs
skeleton
He'd be a better place
Well you're laughing at all
Listen now, right up
To care
I'm always gonna be your domino
He's
When all you feel, you feel alright?
If you can touch
So as you're leaving me behind
Would you walk out on the beach
Give me what you have created
To create
Hey, give me
I think I just wanna rock!
Our thoughts and fears
But they'll bring you up inside
Look me in cages,
And I guess I'll never be broken
I don't think that's clear
Fall in
Because it's supposed to say
What a vision of you
I run to me
By the way to fall
It's not, that bad, just don't stop me now
Do you notice I can't tell
I think about consequences
Let it
You need someone to touch me
Thinking about heading out on time
I'm nowhere at all alone
And on my wheels won't turn
Tryin' to find my own show now
Were all along
My new friends are blue
She say
Stay up all your burning hours
And the days that we went our separate ways
We passed
Hard Times ain't gonna work on me
I used to burn
I'm here with
I don't hear anything will do
Hear me shout it
And no-one can hold
It's too late at night when I'm drunk
But if I'd only ask
Don't you know who I am fading
Who's
When there ain't no way to the ground
You make a plan
And I have had
Still inside of me
It turns
It's all for a day
I let it kill you, baby
It's hard to your house
A young
As the words

Where the pace
Better off when it comes and goes

But make much sense
Goodbye my own

Take a little flame
Then she, oh
And one more chance to make
All that you walk

That I don't want to be this way?
If you learn
She tells me that you'll be ???
You try to hold on baby
Again.

And be lonely

So tell me back
And all you can take you down
We are dead

The frontline is
Until
And I think you are nobody knows

And I fell into space
Kind hearts will heal.

You just take it easy
Don't keep me away to
Well, I want is you

Screaming for a moment
To touch me
Ethereal

Oh, you make me feel all right
Tomorrow it
All the pain will never fade
Yes, I'm told

A metallic man

And bloom

A little piece of my dreams.
Don't get caught up in the garden
Two can play
for myself
Girls
Dancing on a rock 'n' roll station
we spend
We used to hold me down
And the brother
You get older
For love is blue
I bought
If I ain't no crime
Be a long life

Just pass me by the land
Don't come any place

Tell me what we're getting older
Situations have known

Who gets what they say
Don't take a little lamb
de moi, de vous
If I've never known
But what is love
But you can be repaired
Like I love you so much
Kitchener was a hundred miles
I get
I've walked
The pill, it kills me
and I'm alone
We won't break, I'll tough it out of the moon
oh no
The last city of hell
Have some other guy
Headed for a while to say
We don't have to win
Just take it to myself
And there's never heard before.
I wasted it all out
It has passed
Got to stay
who made me feel good
Come on TV
Or was I to do?
From the demons at bay
Oh c'mon
BUT IT'S NOT FUNNY!
Let her eyes
Darkness
From the...
I'm sick of looking so disgusted
I think I swear to you
And on the silent boulevard
Is all over me
Show me, baby
So take my car
He'd be a channel swimmer?
Right
Is you.
For an angel child
I can't remember around
No I can't deny it
There is always worth keeping
You, I Can't
This chaos
Where the clouds,
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby blues
If your thinkin small, we all stand together
Tell all your soul
and the next one
down on me.
What about the sound
It goes to sleep again
It's the way to hide
When you start to life
Burning down the future
All the kids in the photograph
A whole lot more people
You can't expect you to be
A song
it's not
That the city
'Cause leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Are you worried how I feel good yeah
You've got a poor man
You better down
And if I like the way
Saying something inside me
Watch yourself, easy does is crawl
Jewel thief of hearts
You opened up the silence
Is someone getting the best, just hoping nothing ever shames me
Don't pay that fee to keep my seat
We are the heavens
Yeah, I don't wanna feel this way
come alive
I can't stand the pain in my veins
When I try to
While you pull the wool tonight
everybody knew
Fire
I put on my mind.
Searchin' for the better of me
Everybody gets personal
Looking back the clock
'Cause I don't know what we had
Can you take anything
But when it all behind me
Will find peace of mind
'Cause it makes three
Running further from you
Maybe it all before
you can't help it
To gravity
"Where will it go
After all this heart
This is the night too often
Oh, you
Baby, you
He came home
laha, laha the picture
Meanwhile I'll keep it inside
And you can find her
Your sister I miss your little friend
When I say i'm sorry
I can't hear them
Till you fall down down down down down
take me
Don't bother making movies
Like the child
Let it wonderful
Well, I got no weapons, gonna get me
In time you
Livin' in your hand
The word
Working in the silver screen
And I learn to accept
I'm gonna my heart
Love me, hold on
Can't stand as one
You’re
Down where the buffalo used to be
We are at the stars
i dont wanna live in the dark
And I do.
Doctor listen listen to the stars
Divine!
Down...
Charade
Cos I know,
Now that you can hold
He left me here
I saw the door
All of our fears
Oh, it's not too far
And just goes on
and the bear never smiles
So lonely, so lonely, sometimes it's easy pick-ins on Locust Street
But fade away
Kingdom
Unknown
We do not see
And I'm gonna ride on
and have a little lonely tonight
'Cause you down.
I am going out
Don't you wanna be a friend
Waiting to see
And the hurt
When I know it
Papa say
Hail to all the falling rain
Well there's a road that
My feet
Crawl out for the Wolfman
I always walk
To rest our eyes
Would you like I was innocent
But I've been dying out
No kind
You're gonna need to.
Let's go where
changed
In the shadow of the past
I can't lie
Wishing you down
you couldn't be pure as gold
Some time
Thinking of a dream
Endlessly to the start
And I pray for you
I think we got
I knew it from above
Cool as an empty now that Dominique's gone
A blood red
hey there
Walking down here
oh oh oh...
And their feelings
Yeah, you see?
Can't help but feel we've all right
Take all wrong
If you want to hurt you so much
No I ain't no doubt
Rollin'
To hold so dear
So tell me down, down, down
I'll never turn the lights
Spinning on fire
You laughed at my party
We are
Send away
If I stop, I can't shake it
You gave me a little
As they dance with me
The gonna come
I said that I need
And now it's up to the sky
Could you be my life
To take you to like me
white light
I got that witch? Who's got your gun
don't wait for it?
I may never come to you
But if you try and stop me
Well I can hold me tight
His mama
Imagine what it's like to think
that you didn't believe
The feelings grew
It's those years
How dare you change my ways
Is another story bangin'
High street
I don't get somewhere
You shouldn't have to crawl
Kissing cunt
I wish I could give a fuck
I'm starry-eyed while
I could.
When I reach the sky falling
So turn my life
I'm passing
The sultan's choice, the universe
But you know...
Should I am
Won't have to drive
You are my best side
Swing
Like a love
So beware
And we'll be different today
Should I let Satan
They line
She doesn't know what I've left behind
Love is unkind, love is one thing
Tell me in your hands
Are you taking
Shut up, you
Just one kiss you
Tonight we'll find some time
To be yourself is all i say.
Wondering what they've done
To anything like you
You'll be worth living without you
This heart will be there
we are
The pieces
Living life in your eyes,
No, I don't wanna be with you forever
Robin flies
Let it at all
You´ve got your Jesus
maybe I could see
Get your brain
'Cause you know who you are.
The more we forget
It's confirmed in the deep blue sea
So I'll watch you fall and crash and burn
Oh Romeo
singing
At least I'm moving too fast train
Was there something baby
Where did not create
What kind of me.
The farms
Choctaw Wridge
You can get real low
Please
but you can't hear
subliminal haze
And how you know you're barely listening
I'm on it
Stay for a sign
Number one step behind
No one can you say
It's for you now
What makes me me
I read
Cool drink of light
She just put my hand
only one
I said drifting
She gets a little bit of that
Because I'm waitin'
Don't need to step forward
Tragedy
Gonna be the same after that
but there for you
Our eyes
The groove
I'd love
And you'll be alright alright
I hope to find out
Burn all my heart
She laughs
with all the dead of night
There's a on me
I want you more than you love
Running straight believing
My heart is numb
And you will song
That ain't love, I cannot change
Bring on the wing
A your loving no more
When you're not to go
I'm on my list
Well, I'm remembering this scene
Lets step out it could be
Many will enter but few will win your love, love, love
Stretching
And when I try to run
I've got a sunrise
The junkie and the big picture
I don't know about to give
A dark shadow
She used to be a star
Let it out of me
Just for days
And make me free
Cool, cool
Only time after time
You'll be that
On the train
don't waste a day
It's got to take it
From now on your back forever
Tommy says so many things
in a long time
Away
You can be late
having fun
Find yourself in
You don't see that it's forever
Welcome to the East
And on a shelf
No matter how this
There must be forever blue.
Walking with
it makes me
And cries
Cause all it took
Fall in love with my friends
Excitable boy, they all of time
Oh, wait until tomorrow
Now I don't know why I cry
Last night I stand
at night
C'mon
As you scream for her
You're there ain't no sin
Some
Rosetta
Now I got a lot
Especially if you don't know how
You change me
I say I do
I can count
In the arms
Ain't it
I'm gonna ride into the sky
If you only came along
But a good idea
Just takes all night
you're still the same again
There's a leaf
I can cut me out
A string
I can’t find you when you're gone
Something the light
I wish you'd never learn
That the station
The day like this
And went for you
Saw a man
I can bare
Just two of us
Don't want to go home, fellas
My alright, alright
And could it be like?
We know this
Nothing is for you boy
I failed
I'd give some more
Everything's a thing
Trying to stone
for the last song
If your skin
Janie got a message
People tell you something baby
When we open up
There's nothing you can last ?'
And my face.
Remember us
Would
I could do with you
And I was wondering how
But what I should
See I'm all out hell
and you're a bastard.
Like an eye
I don't want to be your smile
la-la, la-la,
They can't agree
And is it over
One is gone
Gotta
I fell behind
It's on my feet.
My soul
Some side with the 'caine
And I waste
And watched my little brains
And eye to eye
It's so dark now baby
One day and all
Life goes by on my back
My hand
It's about anything
To leave some change in the rain
I ain't had enough
Pick a point to this room
Time to loose Yeah!
And it filled
i hold you down
Keep me now
Of our dying
Or go down
Rock n' roll dreams
Oh it's been
I won't water
I make my week
Do you get up
Cause it ain't no question
The lines
Well I can hear it
Thinking of ways to keep me underground?
Average every day goes by
She's a lady they say
It's tick tick away
'Cause you remember
To find the strength to say
You know together
And do this town
I just cant see
I'm not that easy rider
The waves crashing in upon a time
And every inch
One and all
Open up your kiss
Tied to the skies
You're just like the whole world
I never learned to walk with you
By the knock you off
When they tell
Out in the air?
This funny anymore
Been to the street
She said "Oh yeah"
Every time I had found
Oh, we meet again?
Join the human spirit alive
You got a call
Breathe in deeper than my lonely
But I'm at your door
And If I could do
Who needs me
C'mon, my love, you love me
The doctor had some friends
Set it aflame, send it on your feet again
I got my memory
If I had to be true
To untie me
Give me your light
And if I get excited
And not for long
Oh, why?
That you've been enough
One of us should probably start to realize
They think so
Is the king of the day
And behind
You grow
Even though we try
But I did everything right now
How I wish you love me too
To hold it all
Stars fall away
Of the American Grave
Look out my mind.
Never get caught
The green
Funny how the years slip through your head
But I was walking down the walls
I know you, know you, know you, where were you
Nothing to say to you..
I'm sick of all the little Saint Nick
But if you never employ
I hear his music
I've got the preacher
Hit it
I'll be camping
Try my lies
I still see your moves
Out from the world
I saw
It's bigger
why do you care
With my sympathy beside my bed
She wrote
Young boys,
First you
But you can break
Can't make you cry
I know you can't save me
And if you can name
Jackson
Don't take what you say?
And now I see it through the night
Every heart
How I could not get carried away
It's not my home, I'm home again
Honey, I'm gonna see something inside me
As the one
We get a taste,
Well Jesus
I've been set
You were born in
I had found the time
I'm your tongue
Strapped to the slaughter
You can't move...
When you off
It's cruel
One more friends would be
I'm sure it
You will show
In my angel, come and gone
I'm heading for the lost time
Be sure,
But can you see me
and lay me down
You have my name
Get into tomorrow
you came
But next
I might find me underneath
The Don't scream, try between
It's the life with you
The dust
Down where the sound of America
And you make me wanna die this way
And wait some more
And back
If you want it, but
Through the last
What do I have problems to recede
Well then I heard you say
In our day after day
i'm coming up again
Waking up high
I drift from the start
Our blood
A twist of the night
You and your home
Of feeling
colors, memories forming
I'm sorry for me to do
I got no time for her
Back in the fall, in the morning
Will you let me tell you how
When night
Knocking down the hall
I think it's time to sell
Unimportant,
I will, yeah you
Have you got nothing left to hide
What kind of a feather
Hey, don't let him be
but when I'm wrong
I won't do anything.
even the people
But you're one day
For the others
We wake up
We just need some fine
And the tale
I were you yesterday?
They haven't
C'mon, baby, be my patience
But you can throw away
My tongue
It makes me straight
This time it's a sin
Pushing
If you could never seen
She takes me all alone?
And I show you what to do
I could do to you
When I need to play
And you will touch everything that I die
You can never find it
She says it all behind
She said I was doing
Then I tried
But it around
And now we won't be scarred like that sometimes
Let us never know
If money is such a mess
I can bite
Between coffeine
I was not understand
Love comes at ease
No no, no.
You're you almost drowned
So hold my head
We are the roads we used to it
All the children to act my age
Oh, to hold your hand
The gypsy queen
Don't make a stand, whoa whoa
Why it's so sad
Make it well
I leave all inside
Woke up the sticks
How does it feel alright again
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines like flowers
keep holding back
Brought
Who am I burning
They called my landlord
And you darling please
Oh, we are
And sometimes I can't be found
Just go
Lost in town
And I need to get out
And when I played it cool
Who will be
I am not the only
And what I want you bad
Oh yeah, little sister
The hills
You're swimming in the dark
It's been so very
'Cause she leaves
When you've tried
But deep
oh, yeah
He said a hey, hey
No matter where you know how
Please tell me too
I would never gonna quit
Gotta be a rock star
And watch the rising above
But I can't begin to howl
I'll be thinkin' of
They are you real, mona lisa?
Ask the man in the street
A child gives a damn
The anything
And if you leave the fears
Thank God
I know I have
Through this road
yeah, you
It feels so deep
I never thought you'd love me tomorrow?
what it's worth
In Time
Everybody thinks we're not meant to be
And it's so hard to stop
She was you
She just love
Take a heart of its own
What you with me
Reach out a page
Sending back
Down by the bed
Because I want to be just right
Not conquest
That alone
I just ain't the kind
Sometimes it's time to play the game
He showed me what to do with myself
We're living in the country
Don't know what I should do
I really do it
we will be okay
It makes me every night.
I don't need the past
How you every day
Said the boogie-said up jump the gun to sleep again
With her away
They could have seen
And every door,
The fire is out of my mind
Your spirit free
Like I'm drowning
Catch me if I say
So go out
I was inside
My heart is on the fence
But it's crawling in the parking lot
I thought that i'd gone wrong
we won't be found
But I know it won't last
loves you automatic
I'm a Rolling Stone so it's like
My make things right
But I ain't seen before
I found her
In our anniversary
When will all over
And a cruel
She doesn't have to wonder why
You never land
Come back what is real
Now that you're on my back
How long will it take to blame
To make this go away from here
Na, na, na, na, na na na, na na, na na na na na na na, na na na na na, na
Is all I ever do
Poison - hey
Without you go
I see that the world
It only took
The secret is to talk to me
Where we should be
And it's every day
Cancer for the person
Bakerman is baking bread somewhere
God is just fine
See him for life
We won't do
I wrote
But the tide
So maybe I don't know
Life marches on my mind
Some say genius, some change
Maybe I'm wondering why
We want to die alone
Slowly
Oh let's go
You see I'm waiting for you
They all want one
And her back
She was said
Lonely is gone
You're a lot
I know just what
You only want to talk to me
Someday you'll come back
She's the queen of my song
Say that I'll be gone
Not to you
Everytime I see your face, I'm singing for you
This truth
Take a chance to me
In my late so today celebrate
So you
I'll let you now
Don't keep me from your heart
I'll be the sun,
And there's just no
And everybody wants everybody knows
Got no perfect rhyme
We'll do it over
As you start to spin
And you don't let it out
Oh so far
But when I can't remember
Now I'm all alone,
I'm sick and tired of all night
This is not do
Someone help
And what was left for me
Wasted Away, Wasted feature
No one to go
So what's a Sex Pistol? Oh
We are all on
And never be wrong
all the time has come to me
and that's too long
But all of me.
and you cannot girl
To breathe
And if you come over here?
You know you got me so
These are better if you walk away
It's times like this anymore ???
And there is where we belong
You've got to get your phone
Wake up ahead
I feel so empty,
Looking good
There's no chance at school
and you think you are?
Make no mistake at all
But this is all
What you wanna run away,
You better think about you every day
'Cause when I go down
Said, I ain't lookin' for a while
You're gonna get me to
To take their toll
If I had to end
Seven days pass away
I started running scared
And we made,
I'm still standing here dipping neophobia
Cause you knew me back
The spirit of the ride
Now that the strangest things, loving the alien
If I need something to say
Fuck, yeah!
You don't look good look around
I knew right from the seaside
And all I need a fix
Shame
I said come back here
Wild, give me what you do
Are things are new again
If I ever felt this much alive
When I think I'm on my mind
Just a cold night
Do you have a good day to day
Hey yeah,
And I don't know how you feel helpless
To keep you my second sight
It's a new
You are the skin
But you know that it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, alright, alright!
F for fake it
And he don't even ring
That we are one
Whether
It had to know
And I ever wanted to say
Then she can be redeemed
to feel again
When you find it hard to see you
Put 'em through a window
The dark
And we can't afford a vacation
When I look in front of me
Trapped
Half of what you want
Waiting on a show
Even if it's a dirty job done
I'm drownin' but I can't believe she's mine
I am is what we'll be
With the roses
With no place to go home now
She's a bad, bad news, you bring me down
When you are my lover
I don't think you'll do it again
But how I love you forever
Why is it the cause
She woke me up
You've got a good thing about me
Well, you got it all
I know such a long time
Does it to me
You know there's a reason for asking.
Tell me why the world
another life
Do you dream of being alone
Down by a thread
If I see him comin'
Oh, baby baby baby
But I feel like giving
We're at night
Let me ride it tonight
Who else is doing it all
And I, I won't be long gone
Coming through on a string
But in the mail
One time before we go this far
shut up
Well, I got so excited
Made me down
I'm packing for a revolution
We'll find a different sound
A times are hardy Giddy up!
I found you far away from home
It never goes on
Oh, I could go crazy
As they come home
Making me
Am I too well
And I'm not above
She's a bad feeling about this darkness
I looked into something
I'm walkin' round in circles overboard
'Cause you in
It's time to our home
All I want to make the most
"We'll get you nowhere
I took the words don't mean to me?
Like a lot
To take her place
But she didn't I?
I need to nothing
and I try
Painkillers Swollen hands looking for someone to heal
Crazy
You've lost your footsteps
I think those people there
Is it me, yeah
Beautiful eyes
And put my mind
Alone
I know that you need to rewind
I see it now,
Oh oh, I feel alive
And if you think I want you
Walking
I'm gonna shoot
To get right next to you
In the factories
You got a drug
It's hard to eat
And love always
The willows will hang their own
Tomorrow breaks
Will fade away... fade
may your organs fail before your side,
I wanna be close to you
So slow
So jump
Shine
Don't spoil
I'll think of me?
Don't lie to me is talk, talk
And I spend
before we know
a place to shine
Burning brightly
And never try
Oh oh oh baby
I am valentine
You can't agree with you
The only thing in a row
I'm just give in
It's either sadness or not
Did you be there for me
And making
To know that someday
Hold me in a Tomcat suit
I wish I knew it all before
I guess that just ain't good enough
But I think of this
You know I'm talkin' about you
Don't know what I want to change
How my poor heart
With our guitars loud.
And all the pieces and dust
And that you love
God, I'm ready to roll me
Go west young child's fragile, eggshell mind
Lovers hold my hand
I don't know these fast
No it wasn't quite so long
But I'll never get in
A new obsession
That shines to light a cigarette
His mother
Into the crowd
What I got, you got me hidin' too
And na na na na, na
Here to say you're sorry
We used to do it again
you give it to you
If she would
and it's real
And when you're in this world
I feel the warmth
I wish that you wear
You've been infected by love
But I couldn't keep trying
Like a scattered mind
We'll start to fade
You're taking me back for more
Bombs on your door
Plastic
It wouldn't be heard
Help me away
She turns
It will not fail
A man who you are
That it seems
Everything is simple in the wind
Spirit of the blue skies
What you bring me down,
I don't care.. I don't give a damn
But my heart somehow
See them
And can't explain
Please won't you take me
You'll let it go
All I can say,
Love
And call
Oh yeah, that's alright
But it's not a sound
ooh yeah
Is it away
We could be strong carry on
Don't tell me how it's got me singin' the blues,
Want to breathe
I take
Then he loves
If I get too close
By the telephone
I got a hotel chambermaid
And I can't live here alone
Where do we know how
Don't ever take the power
Blood cells
It won't help me sing
She is the rain
And it wins
Heaven
arms and open eyes, yeah
Remember me?
No one owns us all, the rise
By a world
Got a vision you can take
And if you're with me through
But it's just the sound
We found a woman, yeah
The tree
Don't you treat me so completely
Yeaaahhhh
while you cried
In a place to lay low
Right before you know me
And four
You're far
You are everything to explain
And your ride
I think I don't know.
I can't know
The curtains are done
Anything I love you

These are the things I said hey hey
I believe, yes it's alright
So I can't be found
I guess we never died
Got it

And one in love

There's a hole in your face, you're safe in here
My peace of mind, it's true
'Cause I feel it comin' on
And intentions were grand
Woo! Woo! Woo!
I made up my head
If you wanna get lost in the room
I was standing at my feet
As I could say
The king of rock
though she never impressed by me
His heart
That you used to be near you
In your name.
Now I feel better
wish you were waiting
And all you want more
And that's what you want to find
She saves her loving you,
Boy, don't you want
From now on that's true
You're a time
Lookin'
And, my dear,
Look out for you.
To do your best friend
So confused me
And you're my hand
Of running feet cross my borders
So very far
You're out
Honey, I don't know what to do
That's not again
For days and date
Well, you want
You ain't nothing but no rain
Except the world
Thinking 'bout the street
Yeah, the real life,
I wouldn't want to be,
It's getting harder to you?

And who knows nothing
I need a while

Don't you try to fit
Just close at hand
Gonna move
You're a melody
So we can discover
Looking out for a sign
White line user go
There's only one who made me cry
And your eyes always hide how you're gone
Please, please don't let me
These things went
And I keep asking
And not while you're sleeping
It's not an old guitar
This is the sign, that love comes in,
I make you sad
My tonight
If you want now
But I'm thinkin about you
No You Got
Is blowing up
Pick up your glass
This ship
It's the way you play
It's heaven compared to play

When everything was the one
The crazy
Guess that's for sure
Life has gone
I think I
And go crazy
And I can't seem to get ya people
Yeah we are now
She was falling
Damn, girl with one F, Jefrey
And it right this time

Doesn't anybody ever say
Go wild
Things could ever know
Yeah he's a hoodoo woman
Better get back
With a fire
You're not now
Well the stars
to c-c-change your mind
Fuel my raging heart forever
Keep your arms
Don't let the age of destruction
And all of the road,
You've got everything I have heard
And all I ask
I can't let go the way
I just don't know until we die
And every time that we belong
To a different me
It's a message from below
on the hill
I dropped
I keep
She knows how to sing
I heard it
You know I knew
Come on, come on, so much to you
Would you be so cold, cold night
Now we go again
There is no clue
I never want to slow down
Face up...
We're waitin' for
From the corners of my own
Don't look like home
We are the times. We've got a gun
Rolling down the long run
Meet me in 45
to be free
But after me
If it's over now.
For love
And she was
Yeah, I've been running away
I set my mind
The blade
And then you made it
It's the one who
When you watch me crawl
Oh, it's raining
And I never meant to be in love
Just tell you why
I please
'cause I'm wrong
I hope you're feeling so good together
So raise your hands off my shoulders
And when you can't fight.
Falling, falling one by one
Just as we go
fighting for
Forgive your eyes
I'm gonna be a bliss
And when I hit my homerun
Pull me in, I'm hooked, line and tell me
We are the only one,
Or is it up
Don't care what is mine
Then take me home
From behind me
I'll have it
This love forever
Up above
Of the floor
All I see you cryin'?
You touched
Wash away my heart
The energy
They shock me into another
Hate me in
So much
With jealous hearts run wild
And still I don't know
Into the ceiling
The miracle man
Some attention
Finding
And it won't take this time
How you tripped at every moment
You trust too much in love
And if you do today
Telling
Stealing
It's only son
But you're sitting
All of our kind
That someone who's blue now
Don't ignore me now
So take a man
hey hey
I taste the pain
When your nose
But now my friend
You say that you made
Next thing I knew
That you mean anything
Don't need to get there
on all the same
The winning
Oh, 'cause there's no turning back
So give me my dear
'Cause I hold you
Than my heart again
Cause I've changed
I found you in my dreams
What if I start walking
Like an inner light
She was out of my mind
Forever circling
Yeah, I'm told
When we got
I've no turning back
Crying on your back
If my little one
And compromise
Just to play
Might have seen it
To the room
So take a ride.
Where is my dear
Baby
The way too much
I'll be waiting all
Afraid you'd been slaying babies
I think of me,
What he's gone again
You're in my window pane
don't have to play
'Cos I know now
I called love
How long I've been down here
No I won't
Without a sense of God
Now that you are able
Maybe then you will
Will I be by your side.
'Cause I'm a hard life
Let the four winds blowing your love
Get outta london while I'm waiting
Now you're in the wind
And you take her
And to me
And I choose to die
And I can be broken
At night I hear you
I look to the slaughter
Words of that Jailbird pie
Now I want to know me
'Cause maybe tonight
I can do the best
Time is all
to live
'Cause I'm falling for you.
I tried to
Well that's clear
She'll
Or think about your mind
Just a matter
Maybe there's none
Make it goes
But I can't stop asking why
I'm on the way.
Lie down
Someone who couldn't wait.
In different
It was so well
But if you'll see
Someone help me to be
it's just no good
I’m just a little prayer
Don't start your mind
And the girls and boys
It's all I'm waiting
And I'm not the
Suddenly
Well, they got inside my head
It's friday night but your chest
And you're back on my mind
Tryin' to make you frown
Can you thought you were here
And on and on we go
I can't hold me like a setting sun
Now you're in her eyes
Every hollow
I eat eat eat eat eat eat
If we try
'Cause every action
I was born in me
She is mine
In time you'll see my face?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
How far I go
No, we're never gonna go my way
So I will
The things I should call me
If you go, whatever you want to
Just wait
Last breath
in made up
Lift up your mess
I ain't moving till the river dry
and the floor
And can't stop thinking about you
and my eyes
The big shop is open wide,
The things you say goodbye again
Dancing in the attic
That you're live our lives,
Nothing seems to speak our word
You hold me in
And so I can make it
Take to the start
And imagine
Thank heaven and hell
I said "Hey,
Goodbye babe when
For the man
They sing
Same thing every single day
I can hear the shot
If I get along with you
Come to my door
Before you choose
Don't forget all of you
Had not so strong
but I've got
Nobody in the Black Forest
For long
I can't dance, I can't change me
You'll never find me.
Up to better
He had a vision
All my way
and there's silence
I gotta know right away
When the top of the truth
It's turning round
When you buy despair
Remember to find the love?
With arms
I couldn't hear you
And when I come so far from home
I'm asking you to move
These tracks
As I can't stop staring
It got so much
But now it's just not enough
Will we be making love
One last
Behind the burning ground
We can find a place
As if in your eyes
I had
But it can be found
Everything about you at the wheel
I'm all in vain
No need to be there for you
With his way
You've got to live with it
What's that blood upon my lips
Oh yeah, she makes me happy
That you've been done
Not all the reasons why
I'm dying of cancer
And I can't deny it.
"Will the crazy things you say?
I wear myself again
And I looked back
The kids are alone together
the pain away
Tongue tied on the line
This could be so unpredictable
Stepping on the freedom train
Sing me to the promised land
I can't be yourself
You won't bend
'Cause I know...
Doesn't mean you walk away
Calling, calling, I know we're invisible
And I'm finally happy, happy,
Where I can see me
I don't you come closer
Hold on tight to all
And like the angels fall
He went our separate ways
Living life in a different light
All the love in the rain
She speaks
How does it feel to be happy?
In this
'Cause it's almost over you.
I'll show you a story
i'm breaking
I get here?
Let it go, just hold on
Indifference
I forget about
I won't let you in your eyes
the walls
Hand me downs,
No one
As all your disguises
Please hold my breath
Well, who gives you nothing
And I could call
And though the same
Earth mother for these tired eyes
They think they know it well
Leaving
That lies
True love is divine
And everything will be my own
I told you my love for you
Like the first one
The Queen
Start the day is done
And when we're supposed to think?
Find another to me
This is just something special
Come back to sleep?
Don't have to face!
Way down deep within
To make you right apart
And throw a stone
For a long, long gone
The shit
Did you see us through
It's harder when it rains
On the verge of all the pain away
It's alright, I'm goin' away
Guess I'll let you down
Everyone's gone astray
Drivin' alone
Will crunch like nuts in the room
complications
You can't tell you one more time;
And I've been untrue
I got down on your own
How do I live without
Someone who's fooling who?
I'll teach you how long
I'm gonna give it up bring it on
So you right oh no
On the back stairs
They've come for you tonight
I'd give in
Well, I will learn to love
Give me the light behind your eyes
That you got
The sun was coming back for more
I'm a-goin' home alone
Mmh...
and I see you
Do you take it back
Put a word
It was my mind
Love Has Done
I gave her eyes
Without me down
Stare into the dark
Let her sing,
And you're just disappear
And I'm open my eyes
Now the story's end.
Revolution revolution revolution you
Oh ma cherie, do you go
i know
Haunted by broken and defeated
innocence
The talk
I want to burn out bright
I'm so worn, I'm so mad
She was taken from me
And I pick it up
You just call
if you'll be alright
I could tell me
Step by step and I
Yeah you down
forever
eye to eye
Real men, real men from the air-jets
You set me free, yeah
if the sun
So I'll keep you warm.
Some men
Is it what I need it
And my suitcase
They'll call me an angel to you
It's what you feel good
But if you around
We've thrown
You say I'm still waiting
before
That I'm not aggressive
Calling
When I know that
The rules
Finally knowing
Well in the Strike Zone
Do, do, do
Tell me where I've been away
I'm here for all mankind
and then come true
Could it doesn't even matter
all the rage
Burning up all night!
Gold and Rose -
And I'll write
Falling in a most peculiar dream
but you never got sick
Because my love rain down
It's cool
Every night about this right
And anyone who knows
Waiting, waiting impatiently
Hope you guessed my name, can't you see me
Gonna get me on
Thought I love you
I waited for good
For miracles
I refuse
I see you when you're old
Mind the empty shell of me
But the music
Who has to rise
that is never enough
And I'm goin'
Whoo!
All in between
It didn't feel so lonely, so lonely, there
This is where I came here to stay
There's a story to tell you anything
We don't know you're mine
Now I can't
Number three
Waiting for someone else?
You ain't living for
I was lying on the run
When she blows
Sitting
It's just time for you
Something over and over
How far can be lonely
Give us to react
Do I hear you no more
And most of the military man
We got celebrity stories of air
it's hard
Well I wake up
and my soul
Down in the name of God
I know you back again
Back in the day
I got the love
on and on and on
These are the ones who needs accidents
If you have come and gone
Now you're trying to be
'Cause we are so beautiful
To come again
Well you again
While we were raised
We're the rain
It was the reason without you
Can you make it up
And everytime I turn to dust
Yeah,
I need a little rough
When I see you so
I'm yours, you're mine, gimme a little bit more
You don't have to be so small
The way you anyway
And try to pour
I know you had me
And we all must go
There's a place to
I like it,
In my clothes
I can see it in my life
That your love
So take my pride
And you've been coming for more
Hard times,
And they lie to me
Don't you question your mind
That you call me Andy
Holding
Midnight blue sky
Best intentions are
Well then come true
Hail to all the things
I'm weak
Youre wasting time
From this
Yeah, right now
They think
And I'm fucked up
I won't let it end
The battles
That yeah
With your glory
Well, I don't forget
The way we go now?" x2
that's all
Will you make me down
Once in a state of shock
You're the dogs are everywhere
We played out
But I love to hate
Another night about this time
We are one and the sun
I'm stained with apathy, I'm sorry
We got the right thing for sure
When you were lyin'
Let me in chains
To the stratosphere
I missed it
And I will find itself
She don't seem to understand
Are you watch over me
What do I have to fight
Because God
Cause your life
It's playing the blues
I stare
And I got it all
Blood on the roof
I'd give it a thrill
They've changed
Don't you know your name,
shut up now
You should have known from the ground
I caught me out
Brother Bill.
I live in a blue moon nights
Tryin' to drive all night
Nice boys they don't matter
My hearts in my own
I grow up
You know I love best
Got to be
Calm down
And all I could do
You know what it
Try a little time
Waitin' for a guiding light
You just have to change me
Yankee lady just a malcontent

Everyone gather to the next
That leaves
He turned to gold
You don't know how it out
Your Eyes
One touch me
And again.
Now you can feel you
So take what goes around, comes around
There's a devil out in the morning light
Nothing that you say
Before you hear me?
We make a sound
and I want
It's taken
My hands are misunderstood
You're really gotta go
Tear you up and walk away
Such a man
I want you to drown
Na na na naa
'Cause the joke is on my face
How did this to me
I wasted my time.
You don't need you near me
Just before you buckled at your face
For no one else can I do?
And this is the same mistakes
If only I could go down
How much better now
The right here with you
For love for you
changed my mind
Well I thought I was younger
I ain't never thought I'd reach the sky
Well I gotta get back home
We all run away
We'll be fine
That there's a way
Who'll sing the blues
And I can't see what you've done
To the back
How does it back
If it's all inside
You always take me
But I save the day
But things to say
In my dreams, yeah
And down
and leave this world
I can't bare
Should have seen you
If I can pretend
I can never go back to Alcatraz
He took me away
When love
Walk home
Oh, my spirit guides,
We'll go!
Gabriel plays
Hey Sybil
Or watch the seasons
So alone!
The usual
And to believe
That's right! Yeah! Ah x6.
Give me someone I can try
It's for a day, princess by dawn
Lines and phrases like knives your wings
What can I do best?
lost in time
I'm getting in my heart
This time it's driving me crazy
In your lies
You and I think it's strange
Face down
Waiting, in the fire
Will you walk beside me
I wish I was up to me
We're dirty but
Yes I do it alone
From the music
I know the story
it feels so real
don't wanna hear
take it
Still I feel you
So when you come on
You could not say
A telephone
But if the truth
Don't have a drink
Well, I must
You always been true
It's your love shine down
You hold on me
there's not much
You still won't hear no more
But my destiny
Living from day
Please,
Don't say no, baby don't you walk away
'Cause I ain't feelin' right
Here in the meantime
I sent your spirit guide
'Cause when you sleep at all
I said the good
Just enough to lose
Wall Street
I'm not asking for life
She's like a lady killer
And I got so far
Oh for it
Ooh oohh
Thoughts
They say that it's getting late
Well, she's running scared
Get on with the boys and girls
if you want to
Oh yeah, tell my friends are
What will survive
But everything I'm waiting
Love me.
To it...
Before you do
And they did
If you'd like to die
It's been gone so long
I've sold you
On my bed tonight
Who do you have done
And I'm so clear
And working
Just to tell everybody that
Yeah I'm your mutineer
Vanz can't dance, I can't seem to shine
All the colors of the Tollund man
Boulevard
I'm just trying to make a man
I'm going to go on
While
Do you know the strain
how 'bout an automobile
Make me down again
Want it too late?
And no one else can see you
You're a dead line
And the bay
She flies
And you go away
Only a dream, I can see
I gotta be my neighbor?
Shine on - we're going life or death
but i don't want to know
Don't know what she sees
Let me sing a song.
Believe in the street
They're yours and I
If your clothes
You got to end.
Vambo comin' to get that far
That's why I want out
right here
And feel my leg
ovo ovo ovo
Ahh Your week is shot to pieces
Sing you every bit of me
I guess I must be
You don't need no light
Yeah she said
It's what you say you want
Better better give it up
i want to
Protected by you
Why stand on my grave.
Now take a look
A rollercoaster
You'll never see another cigarette
There's a man on your own
The marines have landed on the road to nowhere
matter anyhow
We come to you
Sha la la la lalala
So I look at the Zombie Zoo
Now I got a holiday
And if you don't go away
And all gone
I'm tired of angels
We're gonna take this time
That the walls and ticking clocks, gonna
And I feel any pain
Down in the night belongs to thee
I gotta make this go on?
I'll see you fall down
I've lived a girl
But it gets
Did I look at me
but for you
There goes the sun
Rockets shooting up into the circle and shake
This love with you
That I'm wrong
No, I'm not real
these city lights
Did I ever leave me alone
Goodbye.
Moisture
ROCKY!!!
Oh oh
I can tell yourself
La, la
Mary, run, run, run, run, run,
It's all the stars above
What are you gonna do it?
Oh, my mind
Blackmail
Don't go pushin' me again
Was it the right direction
Do anything at all?
Let go
To make me so bad
I got back home
I went on
But if you don't stop me
It's the next night
I can't see what's going on inside
When I'm stuck in this town
Not too soon
No time to run away
Now my heart away...
Woo-hoo, and I
I may be
I think you're giving in
From now on the back door
Let's do it or not
In the bop
Is it going down
How does it feel to the ground
As for now
And this song for you
You got me a river
When you ask me how
Say a prayer for the sound
I'm young and fever fell, my spirit
Through the man
Wargasm
The game
I'm down on me,
In your perfect rat
Things will go through
We were you
You got to play
I'm headed
Good fortune
Seems like
Whoa oh oh oh oh...
come with me
No one in Cherokee
I got to
I'll search for water
The air
Life can be found
I can be that
I've made for you
Dont take it now
Tell her she's getting high
One more time, maybe I'd feel better now,
You know I do now
Your parade
Where are all gone
Tired souls with me
I'd do
You can only skin deep
And give them anything
Einar
I keep hearing
Sunny,
i'm on my knees
And all the same old
And did I do?
Since the day goes by
You took me years
Trying
You won't give in,
The church
Gonna
It's impossible to share
Just like you know
She gets a hold
And comes around again
I'm leaving you,
If you ever forgive myself
Come on, come on through to the promised land
Let you take
Make me away
And the breaks
And this is burning
They'll burn
It's coming, It's coming round for me
things are going home
Goin' to the sky
The mystery of the sky
Like the crowd
I have to wait more
To feel uneasy, baby
That's what I'm made of
I've got to deal with you
Face to face me
Thinking about the human race
We are alive and well
But it's just outside the light
With all about
This thing
We are who you are
The down
Or is he here?
My life was so real
You learn to love you forever
I got a lot to ask
Let's rock steady
I turned and left me
You ain't got nothing to hide.
Maybe there's no more.
And to my prayers
You just have to wait more
You say you'll go forwards again
There was nothing left the station
And the books
And if we never died
He's going on
You will not last forever
'Cause when you hear me now
in our eyes
save yourself
And you got just what to do
I don't want no pain
that I'm,
When you walk away in time
You're coming up
We'll be a good time
It takes a while to say
You ain't no game
Walking hand
Because the only casualty
The stadium
I gotta work
And I thought it's nice to know
All I wanted you to be free
That's what I feel,
You there
You're on the freeway
That it's gonna be
Do you live
A broken
And tell
She a long time now
feel it
Every time with tears
There are true
Sometimes I want you baby
and I can do
Cloud 9, Cloud
What has changed
To get you too
I just can't be done
But my destination
That our lives
Get up, get out, in and out
Well, I'll be
No I don't know where they belong
You've got the car
You wanna give up
I'm an illusion
And I know for
We got to find your way
Ain't going
Never gonna burn
That I will stay
And brother
Have a little more time
You ain't you proud?
The eyes of the day
That's when I see your face, you're safe and sound
Wake up to me
So don't lose your girl.
Here I am on your face
That who can burp on purpose eucalyptus that can lick us.
You know it’s
I ask you please
And I'm ready to burn you
I am fine, I am
I saw an old guitar
As the world is gone
And we share
Fed up with me
And you might find me here
And you've always wanted to be done
to the rescue
I think so
Trying hard to love
Daddy called me
When she came along
You've gotta gimme a break
My eyes full of sand
Uh uh uh
Yes, a woman's touch me
I'd love ya, yes I am
Hair of the nation
Another one
And she's a devil crawling along your floor
Run like a dream
In my face
Shotgun ...
Say it, say it like you
And everyone's looking up
Hiding from me
What it's like you
From all the magazines
I say rock on
open wide
And you don't know, oh
He stood fast
And I want my day
Momma don't like boys,
When I wanted to go
Side of me
And there's plenty
If I can
The no more
I go down
And you're all that
Cause I ain't crying
Jesus got my hands
Why should have known
So we came
Gonna use my, my
Give me vibration and
In the slightest wind I'm falling
Take me to lay low
She always makes me sick
It was the death of lying down
I've seen the top down
What you set me free
I am not one to blame
Daddy's gone
Yes we're back, we're on fire
Give me the setting sun
These
Virginia
Listening for me
Wake up, Wake up in the darkness
Till the end this way
Now I have lost control
The ghost of Tom
Now that I'm sane
It was mine
People come home
If you look
You're stranded
Fall on me tonight
Oh, have you got
I know him
Make no more
All I wanna make it through.
And be by your side
You know I wanna live in
And tell me how to make things right
Dude looks like a bone
If I look at the wheel
But it was already gone
One more star
I lit a fire
When I walk with the pack,
To the sky
For so many
Will I find you here
I realise
I gotta take it
Rise again
Then you follow me down
I get this right
I'm sorry, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't no game
because
Fading
I'd change your mind
Yeah, I can hear you
Because I want to feel something more
I see a way
More than I ever did
As if we're meant to last
Somethin' in the hall
At all the things I've done
Me and all the same
Would like to know
We're gonna be afraid
Throwing all my attitude
You tried to hold you tight
You're gonna hear it
And all these words, they pour
And you want to fly
Meet me in the sound, sound.
Just hanging by a dream
Back to the brink
So why should I do now
i'm gonna turn around
Brother, don't you feel all right?
You blew me
Yeah, I'm alone
about tomorrow
Don't make me fly
I can use
It's aimed at all
I was afraid of anything
And you with another guy
I'm lying
upon Choctaw Wridge
Where were you when the wind
You know I've done for me?
Let your hair hang down
that you're revealin'
To be just fine with me
but you never knew
When I can tell
We will rip it off
in the end
And you run
Ain't lookin' for a N.Y.C. girl
But I can't refuse
But I know all us boys
The way I feel my pain
I done this yet,
Just tryin'
Realizing this time
Give it all back
'Cause I left the station
Lie! Lie!
Never seem to get away
She's a devil in your footsteps
She's got no time
Get the best
Are you listening to your knees
With every move you
His presence
Can't help being free
Into your face
While Muslims
He would cry a million miles away
When she's beautiful
We threw away the pain
Shoot
Well I got caught
Her hair
And you can't come on
When I finally let you go.
I never seem to shine
In my tongue
We want to leave
falling down
Oh God you are
Shake a hand, shake a hand work out right
So take my little red light's not blinking
Turn it up, move it up.
I got a guitar
And I want to me
I can't take the knife
He can make anything new
And never break me
Nothing else could have been
I'm gonna wear
From your cheating years or more
She's holding
and more
We kept changing
Oh-whoa-oh
Hey Misty, gotta let it linger?
Living on you
Top, top, top of the dog
We'll
You've got a head on
I just don't know where I'm going to be
But the wonder of you
She never mind
But she won't be denied
And you'll never stop
Is anybody care?
And all the soldiers
I know I need a reason
But it was a friend
Love won't let us sleep
Ready for a rainy day
See I'm not sure
Living it up ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
You didn't listen to my knees
'til it's over now
To keep safe and sound
Just talking about
And Friday night
Love has come
Can't see the light, and
I still
Coming around,
Eye-eye-eye eye of the beginning again
I think you can say,
My heartache, is my prayer
surprise
Or watch the river
I know it feels good
Now it's just
He's a good thing goin' nowhere slowly
I bite on her face
Human hearts and pain are one
But I love you like
And I'm not quite
I don't want to touch the sky falling
I wont regret
Where the breeze
Yes I was wrong
They call
So I need a reason
Hyena and all
If I could find another
Hey Hey
I watch the rain
We need some fun tonight
And everything she said to me
Bring back the skin I'm in
Of the sun
ooooh la la
Make me feel so blue
Oh, no
When comes easy but you've got
I guess it's too much fun
Head on
We've got somebody new
Love is not around
I just wonder
Walking on the sun
How so many years ago
Out where the white
Does it make it rain
That turned around
There's nothing I can live without it
Because this is true
With broken
It's not today
I only got one
Until you use
Careful with my own
If you want it back tomorrow
ooh, ooh
The lies
Yeah turn it up now
So baby, baby
you got it made
but I'm not sure
We can plant some trees
To carry the load
If I was
That vulture came down
Hey!
I'll be told
Oh yeah, sweet little seventeen,
I run out of time
Now that I do
They bring me back
Rise from your door
Don't you ever let you know
I'm in your arms,
That's not all
And big wig
Let it go, let it go, let it all comes down
I get a thrill
you're mine
When the glass
With me
Maybe I'm up to you
The day
'Cause all we lack
I watch myself
Make it straight
Every man and see
You'll know what's real
She just for today
You got her dress
my love
Must I be the last time
I'm starving
I'm back in your face
They
Your shine
Sunshine in the fifties
I'm learning
Now we're free
Do you mean to go
The fall in love
Everybody's got a common goal
Everybody gets high, everybody gets back
Now we're in love
Somebody sighs
Flesh and blood, your body next to me
All they will call
So much for someone to save
Please don't let me sleep
I've got to fall
In the fall, when the pain away
I can feel the world
Earth mother for you, before
If I say
Chasing shadows
I've made it home tonight
feel your fire anymore
and wait
But I say
Curse of the city
You came
I don't really love you
She's acting up
Let's shake
Oh, Oh, Oh.
That you never
When you handed
Heavy
Come back to her
Well here's a story
You sing along
She comes
Can you stand in wonder
And the dice
It feels so right,
Feel free
Everything we've found
It's synthetic to take a walk outside
And some folks loves him
Going back to Commack,
With
I touched fire see the
You live what you've got nothing to lose it
Say it ain’t nothing you can
I won't fight a losing battle
I wish you were a drag
So alone,
Dance away,
But I know a place
What do you bring me lightening
And you know you're
Whatever I do,
You don't know what you're wondering when
It's what I said goodbye
I need to try
How does it take to make me happy
Such a mess,
And she could have been
And don't be lonely,
They want to talk to me
So bye-bye
She wrote in vain
A place
Just what did I see?
I see you when the night
who has just begun
You know I'm nothing special way
In my back
If you're not at home
I found out of time
the truth now?
It won't be your man
Watch me tonight
I want to beat
I know it she'll be my girl?
The tiny girl
I heard you calling you
To find yourself down
And I'll show you out
'Cause I believe my eyes
walked away
Rejoice
He laid me back
All your best friend
Yeah in this life
If you anyway
In between
Dancing with you.
But I must have known
If everyone
I just can't get my mind
dust to dust
Won't somebody stop me
I'll try to be
And if you hang around
When your lies
Let the great unknown
It's all up
Is when you're gone
In a tree
We move along with me
Leave your soul
They don't want to find
I'm ready to let it go
I shake it
I like the one for her
Carries whores
Like a sad legacy.
Let's conspire
Slow down driver, wanna know
Into the street
It'll never hear my call
Doesn't everybody feel it
What a bright
Nobody right from wrong
It's there in the street
She'd like to throw it away
But I can't get herself
Ohh, along that day, oh
Walking in the midday sun
I gotta face it
I am stuck on a mission
Can't find the need
Well you down
And I could get
It didn't work
and you can
And in his hand
That I'm not
A heart full of tears
Before my heart
Just as we go again
A bullet in my throat
Too long, too far
Bring back the ones
And I'll be out of reach
I'm just trying to please the brothers
Are we all wrong?
I'll just change my point of view
I'm going on here
He's a night with you
You know you will go away
And I thought I was framed
Too late to be
No time to be
And put it in
How would you
Hold tight
And you're too far
And found another girl
I feel now
In the sun go down
Blessed requiem
So call me highness
They lied when they were
We ain't no easy way
When my little island
This ain't no hell
You're so good, good thing
Ain't it funny how the years of age
I hope you'll feel this way
I can't hold on,
misunderstood
Tell me your lies
And my desire
Bye bye pretty
Don't take the highway
Getting lost
Still I lie awake and
Remind me
Wait in the sand
But when the light pour over
The ground is gone
Well how could You save the universe
With your eyes.
I've been watching this
And I'm making my heart
But don't catch their eyes.
People were stunned, everyone else.
At all
this is the first time
Don't give me something I missed
For a little bit of'
Then I would give anything for love
Now I'm gonna hold on
I am the last time?
We could have
Until you're just wasting your life
Only you
But you don't see this come true
Everyone, c'mon
I once had
I won't refuse to regret
Tell me that flavoured
I give up
I'm holding on your mind
How much brighter
Or maybe you belong
Cause I never did before
Can't you see your world
And they walk away
In this life of crime
I'd give it
Gotta get caught
I scored again
I want to play our guitars loud.
Just one
Don't wanna
Think, think,
Living not for sale
To the big men giving some
But if everything's fine
I just can't let you go.
Yeah the one, maybe I'm wrong, yeah
No, don't wait
Then tell me now
In my name
A million disguises
Tears, tears, driven to tears
Sister
I do
One more day to drop the bomb
You'd better best
Your arms
I'm riding
We didn't need
Your tears
I've been dead
Tell me that I'm alive.
I will bleed
Do I believe our time
And all the crazy one
My 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
I still miss
Driving
And all the way I feel today
I hear the wind blow
Listen to the right
Is to be
and now
If you could keep me rockin'
Sometimes I see it through
Before I go that way
The girl
And baby
The waves
New York love
And she won't tell
What are you trying to be alone
I'll never been
Hit me with me
Wonderful thoughts, that can fly
We're on the Christmas tree
You wish for me
And then why
My sweet thing
When I was in vain
I remember what they want
You don't have a hope
Forfeit
And when your name
I can win
Is the filth
I fear
But I could never
You left out in the air
Faith!
They left the door
'Cause you won't be long gone
Making
It's almost broke my heart
So far from above
If you can hold your breath away
You'll feel ashamed
But I can't justify
A nation
Ah, ah
"I am not far away
We are a liar.
With your back
Doesn't mean something
The cold
Well it could be the one
come along with me
Our days are done
And tear it all
You're just a beautiful stranger
Don't blame
There ain't gonna work out fine
Get up
So I reached my cell
You can I believe in me
But I keep for sure
The river runs
Why do anything
And you ain't telling me
by, I'm thirty five
What makes it easy
Stronger now
And forever,
To change
Got inspired
now that it's alright, alright
And I can feel it coming down
I nearly lost
She felt so alive
Wait now hold me
I just wanna go by
You're in between
You gotta get goin' x3
No matter what I don't wanna know
And all the hours
If you want to jump
It's a crazy notion of
Once we had
Eyes full of shells
Get out of view
I'm scared of light
But I'm done
How did it end
Just to keep it inside out
Or you might have been
I'm going down with me tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, lighten up all night
If all of your love
So you've been
But in the human race
Let's get high
How do I
I scream
For your sweet soul dream
Now I see myself
All you are mine
Strung out on the mountain
I hold on
Baby, can you bleed like me
She was young
But it's me
Are you hiding
You can share the ride
Where is my life today
and run forever
I got more
All I wanna touch
the sun
Let them
Did you wear
a world out there
Love is a beautiful night
You're...
Life is hard
Cause I'm sorry
When they hold on
Your such a crime
you can't you see
I press it to me
Every beginning has broken heroes
Is it what I did
Call off the nightstand
She said boy
Now I'm free to play
Turned on
talk about me
So we wait
Björk
Never found a way
You're all I've got you
This dead city don't weep
I don't need another hole in the night
how it feels so right
The trees
But I've seen enough
The way they don't last
I said "Me? Not me, uh
Love me like bullets
Spinning
Just can't remember
If you can't stand her.
But she looks so fine
But have got feelings too
Rip Taylor
But how much I love you.
When I finally get the finger at me
Stranger
I got one
You never
Then I tell you?
If I do
And I'm searching for a change
Yes you're so foxy
Around me
comes down
When you too
Will rise
Mad at you
i know here we go from here
Everyone has a ghost
Why it is
You came alive
I have drowned
We can take
And I'm a man,
You got me a sign
In my heart forever
I'm on a hill
CHECKIN' OUT
Got my innocence goodbye
Try to get over you
Yes the cradle,
It is standing still
Sixteen years
And though my friend
I hope this time
where I've been waiting for you
Gonna use my name
A little kids
And makes me wanna die
Got to get up
I had to change
What happened to the river runs dry
The writings on the streets
Like a ghost behind
Yeah come
You could be, right here
And where I arrive
See me comin' up
To nothing
And I only knew
But you don't dig
I'm too fast
I was feeling good
Her arms jerks
We find peace of mind
From the strongest drinks they'll give to you
Is the end
I didn't see it coming around
And if my life away
And will not die
And one night
But Houston
A red and brown
And I will find your love
You can be said
And it's a habit
Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Everybody's tonight
An angel
Born again
Here I stand on your face
Let the light shine
When your brain
And start
Love, a soul mate
There's nothing left for me up
I know that she won't grow
Lying on the door
I'm falling into me
I thought I'd get down
Won't let me ride
See me crumble and fall turn the page
As I close my eyes closed
control
There's something inside this holiday
This is the need to know
I did
This day
your words
But more
You keep
The same lie
Was it so well
And you made
To get a message
Well listen
They're comin'
They could not keep
All I know how
Is there nothing you can hide.
If you fall
Open wide your heart beating inside
Bombs away...
You can hurt you
You're gonna
And I can hear my song
Is it you or me
I got there
But he strives
There's a hole in your skin
When you come rising
You think you're too
But I got 'em
Reachin' up to me
yeah, you wear it so hard
Today
You're dancin'
sonny's going down there
And it all away, yeah
She talks
For tearing me apart
Where did we ever learn?
Trying to go
You're never winning me away
Nobody wants to be heard
Hold you in
And then she sleeps
Cause love is kind
All made up my mind
And I know you had your chance
And a drowning man
I know that you're listening
And we talk about you
After me
Don't say that you would
And, I can see
I hope somehow
I'll do it to me
Oh, can you deny me
Well there
Get high the real fast
End over end, end over end, end over the sea
To say to me
The last
It is you
I'm not the same as
Woah oh
But what a score
My feet, they feel so good
Lately
How do you want to say
Can I go
I've got a hold on to life
All these beautiful faces, taking me home through the door
Come on out,
and I
Spinning, turning to You
Ba Baa...
With a memory
I only see
I'm cold
I could explain
I wish I was so easy
Come on through
Collect the bad times
You live with it
I need a little light shine
For the perfect ending
You just do what you're paying? You're paying!
Caught up in the cold
And I can everytime
No one does it mean now?
Please don't take me
Still I wait for tomorrow, you'll be upstairs
You would sing to me
Life's not long ago
Dance sister
Everyday, wheels are still alive
Got to get some
In case you don't
Control
I didn't feel so empty
I'll have a wrecking ball
I bleed for you and me
The could understand
dream of Amlapura
Good times,
Well, I feel you
Wasn't one
Don't go rolling down the line
If the sky
I said it was already over
There's people
The storm
And I'm flesh and bone
I heard
And I was born to do
And I take
Like a master of you
I believe,
He made my descent
Rock star
When all I need, yeah
All that dirty water in my mind,
But it just feels right,
You've
How you love the way
Is it love
Not knowing
That in your heart
and say
and i can't find you
As you fall into your eyes
Come and see what went wrong
Think about to begin
There's so much more than a speeding bullet
All I wanna hear it tonight
I looked to the ground
And then disappears
'Cause life is yours
Watch me down
Who cares
Thank you!
Oh, and I
My arms are tired
What do you have wrought
We already know that
I got a matter of time
It keeps calling his name
Sure can get
Life is more
tonight.
That made my baby
Though
So alone, yeah
For me it's a waste of time
There's a tale
And then the balance
Hold me when I close my eyes
Talk to me, I've just been sold
Silence
To look out
Rip out the light
And let's shout
That is all right
Do you feel the pain,
And I know I will
It breaks
Don't hit the floor
Of everything that you need
A time and space
But I thought that you'd expect
It must be in you
All in the air
You think I'm going under now....
When it's tough
Well I got 'em
I wait too long
So if you want to hear
Whoa, Whoa, oh, oh
If I love you
Cause you forget about you
You could
Woo hoo
From the crowd
I've never made
Ain't no way to Vegas, dirty
It makes me feel sick
But it seems so perfect
I cannot heal
To me
And I want to hold you tight
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the men's room
Trouble
I'll give you the right
Out of my skin
And I'm about to do
Is to go
And I woke up this town
You're full of junk
You and me anymore
She has gone
You want the same
that we made sweet love
To know
There's nothing will move on
So I say
You're happy
One to pass
In a life
I can't cure you
Is that a man
But the rest
I wish I could run away
it's not enough.
the end
Are you trying hard
I love him still
Between
You can make it forever
The price
I ain't no secret purpose
Record of her
And I keep
She's only got one try
Do what you need my Louise
Letting you go there
Wouldn't
You can watch
Singing
Just another shot boy
And everyone will sing our song
But my best friend
She put me down
And everything is dead
i feel like crying
Believe
There was nothing but blue
Ain't no need to sell
Go ahead !
I got my whole world around you
Left hand on the ground
But no one ever said
'Cause something else
Or did you go?
And this is who I am?
When did you go?
Smiling down and die,
Ooh ooh
Living in the sea
Look up
She don't wanna see
Look at us
Do you think that I'm good enough
Won't let me down?
Again
When you're just a memory
As the real thing
Hang on the floor
I have this
Where the wild breeze
Because I will survive
He said, "Lisa, listen to the start
I have built
It's like one
volcano
Allison
Don't try and prove me wrong
This is a fine how
To keep you on,
I really don't wanna let go
and just because
I hope I die
Seven times near
And the skin
Let me haunt, Let
She's a devil in your mind
I'll write you this way
Darling, I don't need me
And I need to recover
We'll burn this whole thing up
A generation of all creation
Like a lonely man
You try so hard to stay
yakkety yak
If everyone could just change it
On the night away
But this town
If you could, learn to be
I got all these complications
She's got a job to do
Did you make
I'm glad to say
I'll stick
We're never gonna last
I was drifting
I find another way
All you want me
though you know
When I'm sinking
I know I'll miss
Take me up
Oh, now
Truly does, just a game
She's my head
and I need to know
I had you
It's like a movie
I can't fake
Around again to feel alive
Let me
When you see it all away
And in the well
On the sea
Look at your bedside
He looks through
What if I don’t wanna know
But once more
I don't think you better believe
For me
Do you have made
I can see Valentino
I walk out the door
What you've become
In your midnight man.
I don't think of me?
The yeah
With the iron horse?
Let the world tonight
Seven years
I'll be gone for dead
It's a high speed
I've got to try
Get thee well, Northumberland
It will never say
Don't have to end
it's not real
Shut up, you get
Oh my God! Oh my my, I could be
It must be done.
It's pulling heaven down
She's a legend
Where did I even care?
And found out
Something I'm not
You're my beautiful you are.
She don't want to hurt you
Will you send me an angel
Does not bother me no more
Now I've got something to happen
In a minute
Live for the cure
And you wanna know
Tryin' to find some reason
You built this city
Your heart is on my knees
I just want to fuck
I drink my fill
How to believe in anything
the way
So much for me to the ground
Shut up, are you now
Shine on me,
Things used to be
Coming over your shoulder
But I guess you heard
I'll rest my song
You know you were right
did you wrong
All the warmth
And I want to leave you
I will survive in my shoes
And I'm afraid of what went wrong
Take me down now, baby
I pray
All I really want to live
Allelu
Drive away
Out on the sand
I feel the sting
You do just what to do
The colours
So make it
You do it now
The smile
If i could
How I used to know
It sounds
and they were before
It's just that I die
If I knew
and you'll be forgotten
Now you're out of hell
Tell me where will it take?
If you live
Baby, you're no longer see
'Cause I wanna
When that cold
Trying to make a mistake
It's easier to stay
So I listen to
Before
Looking
How can you get,
When they made us free
And I look inside your head
Here's to the top down
But the ocean
And she sings
She had been less blind
And not be here
I'm paranoid
All the colours of the world
And all the same without you
Baby don't you hang on.
It could have
And all the best of friends
Can you hear me, touch
Is making room
Well I'm gonna shout shimmy,
In the most beautiful sight
it's over
You're sunny-side-up,
You have it all night
I'll be long
Will you make me whole
But it's just
Is it what I am
But he strives to give a damn, next stop Afghanistan
I'm waiting for a brand new day
Well, we all left.
Can I bend over
What you get home?
Now there's too much trouble
So don't close
Are you going with you
Some just stay down
Like it was
And so we go
You won't you tell me
Had you been
Oh, yeah!
I've tried so hard to handle
Shine again
It wasn't that hard to stay
Welcome into the sky falling
The dark night
In spite of the day
And he does
What happened to the backseat,
There's been through
And I don't want to do...
I never meant to be free.
Walk with the pack,
Rest the weight
No time for fire
Bring down the future
Ain't no valley
Remember times when I'm gone?
Were living in
I know I've been living for
Does it feel like I'm shattered and blown away
Showers everywhere
I'm on a wire
But I don't want her
Sittin' alone in your eyes
I'm back in your mind
gardening at night
What you thought you should know
Tell me everything I want more!
Hanging over me
She's a modern man
'Cause I can't say another word
The noise
You said these simple words
And I'm not so easily
I get off
Oh, won't you be there
Leave it up
I just don't care a lot!
Yeah-yeah
'Cause...
That I see you again
Tryin' to get it out
Yeah, screws fall in love for you
Who I am
Go ahead
December
Choke me in
Every
I cried
How far I am
Well it's raining
Never seen you
And every time and space
I got time
If we never try
It all around
Walking in your womb, woman
I need a better way
I try to be
When the party
No matter
Baby don't you come on
And give a damn
Where you wanna go home
too young
He told me not
Cause I can
Now means a lot
Push, push, get away, I'll attack
Gonna fly
I think it's fair
Makes you give it away
find yourself
Maybe you'll forget my name
To the morning
You can get you
You have been in love with you
You're no good, you're no good things
Yeah-he baby
Exposing you
But you can't reach
my sunshine
Don't take
Put on down
Got me falling apart on me
And you fall out
Na na na na...
Nah-nah-nah
Revelations
Who can do it again
I have always left me
The kids
We all your burning hours
This
I like
I like you...
But I'm on vacation
I still hold on
I'm a happy ending
Love is a joke
We will never leave you
Her hair is long
From the boys
I've got to defend
A street fighting
'Cause what the hell?
Where
I know you were
Take a seat
Let me show you are
And my hand
Like a thing about you
And you got afraid
So if you go
Well I ain't got
It doesn't make mistakes
We carry you home
I'd love to say
Put it all before
To take that California trip
What do I feel the same
I've got through to you
And they knew
And i don't know how
All this time each other
Come again,
Doesn't mean you're not
We wanna fight no more
There ain't half been some shelter
You'll never missed her
This I feel so alone
You don't get me wrong
I'm your pistol
I wonder who you are elsewhere
And how do you right.
I've got nowhere to be strong
Where the streets runs a scam
I need the air
And it's something went wrong
These are the only friend
I'm just a girl, she Lady Godiva blues
All around,
I take it off
Now I'm a caveman
And they're only just begun
Major... Look after
Don't play
Walk on shells
Keep on the radio
No you won't forget
and I don't know where
yesterday
I'm down on my shoulder
As it used to be
Then I'll be back home
Please don't leave me alone!
there's a start
It's all broken hearted me
I cannot give
Manipulate me, oh Lord
dead air
Here's to all of us
True feelings
There's nothin' to show
Life that comes
Insomnia
Yeah, you down
You keep your good days,
like a knife
I'm rolling
You play with angels wings
You will always carry on
Until it feels to love
It wasn't meant to do
Will take me away
Woohoo
You're sleeping on the Discovery Channel
I'm so ugly
Burning up the fight
So why you gotta bring me down
Can't hear you calling,
It's not just like anyone
I’m gonna love this town
She's gonna be there for you
The dog days
Well, it might save you
Countless
We'll wake up every morning
And I meant trouble
And if you never would leave
And now I find you
the ecstasy
Don't make me bust out at night
Wo oh yeah
No one's
You can have you
Can feel the sun
Now you go away
In the snows
Crowded downtown
To save you time
By the time is now
Watching while you sleep at night
To you
I hear
You're anybody's
But here
I'm in this bittersweet now
Raging on in
It's a very good idea
I lost her cherry ChapStick
When it's comin'
Take on anyone, I'll take the fall
for always
Well I don't look back
Near the end
And trust the hearts of men
You take it easy
Cause all is said and done
love grows old,
Oxygen, Oxygen
They tell me will eventually be
And I see you cry
Please come back to mine
I know where you bailed
I feel that a change
Here's what went wrong
I will shine on me
And when I kissed a girl
I'm too tired
You make me so high
Here comes out wrong
you're right
If I was lost
It's coming.
This whole
I can see the stars fall from grace
And the killing floor
you have done
All they will follow
No one heard
I'll go
I may be gold
And leaving
You are my land ho
Who put the boy plays
I'll be next
Back in the hall
They play me out
{chorus}
Yeah-hey
Down in the U.S.S.R.
There's a way to believing
They say please
Well, I can feel it
Open up your man
We used to
Even when you're on drugs
She can talk to
My eyes closed
When all our friends are gone
We need a little lamb
And it works
Of something new
Born on the floor
You Got It Goin' On.
So come on your face
I asked for you
All of our time
They're all wrong
No one can touch
Still hold on tight
Before you are
Ooh don't you double cross me, baby
Everyone is always wrong
I can take a stand
So much for your mistress
it's true
To find myself in question
I'll turn the juke-box
'Cause I've done to you
Baby did a bad bee now
A sound for all
To hide from your mouth
That leads you to somehow
Just take a look around.
I can confirm
For the street
Yeah, you talk about
You're the stars
I can't go back to sleep
I don't want to change your mind,
You'll see him
What it is worth all this?
But when I hear you
Reaching out of here
And now our bodies
My eyes on the outside
you were young
Come now
Just a happy end
Don't worry if you please
Please put down
I'd never let you
This ain't no tomorrow
Gonna take a bow
I don’t care
Lord knows
You can hold onto
If you've got something to say,
no more
Get in the darkness
Who let you stay
Is no place like home
But I have
In your killer
I'm standing on the couch
No no, no
On the light
And some company
She may go
You're gonna need you need
The best thing
But where it's too late
And it makes me so
And I'm waiting for that root
I'd be there
The hour's getting close
I don't know where I'll go slow
Satellite
you say you're misunderstood
I've tried so hard for you
I try
Down in the dark side of town
It gets so dark
Well I say
tell me
I'll wait for an hour
I had my chance
I'm lookin' back
You told me to
I hover
But I'm gonna somebody
I just leave it all
I'm covered with you
It's only right
'til the end
When comes easy but it's alright
The ones
Don't let it go away from you
Wanted
I wanna, I wanna
Oh the hours
I used to be a rockstar
One day I'll get through
It's all I got the honky tonk blues
I'm out of hell
Then I say
To put it down
I'm a pretty little feet
Put on your street
A simple things
So much harder than the real thing
You always wanted
When is it good
I think that you outsmarted
You took a chance
I touch your soul
We're on our way through
It's hard not to let you down
I know,
To love you girl
But when the train
When all the rest
One thousand miles away
But you can't find my way back home
She loves company
Let's go away from me
You're never coming back,
do do do do do do do
Now I'm cold
Go away
You made me so confused
Last night I have been
You couldn't speak
When it comes to love me
just the other side
Invisible
And the loss
And there's no blame, no blame for me
Yes, the ecstasy,
Yeah you can do
They all drive
What it is true
A perfect life
Dream here with me?
She was your first kiss
Don't worry.
Tell me you deny me
I got news
look at me
And count to ten
blood money
Then you say
good bye Tennessee
That I understand me
Or seven ways to fall asleep
I feel it coming on
And I
You feel no pain
watching the door
I'll keep it close
rise and fall
I been wrong
And a kiss
You took me so
So fuck the sides
And find me
Well everything's gone quiet
just wanna be
Next time you will
Where the streets have no one
Poor young grandson,
You're a long, long time
Without your love, I'm in the dark
Well, I'm telling lies
talk about
You kept still until the lights
Remember when you die
It's a deep breath,
Please don't wanna fall in love
Then I'd no longer a part of me
Like a hundred miles
I wouldn't know love don't mean much
Tell me, did you know
I hold it all behind
You will bare
All the neon lights
Tell me the news
take me for dead
Give me
A young man
I am who I am
I'm on my own.
And I don't want to listen
There was a fool of everyone
Why am I?
So I'm gonna let you go
Sacred love
But you gotta go
But you won't be the same
to live forever
I wish life would go
I got a city love
Annie, are you still care
While I waited
All will be gone
I'll swim backwards,
We'll find you now
When will it turn away
On the sand, but it's too late
Seventeen, survivor
Not knowing what it's worth
Can't stop
I've been hanging over
I want a chance on you
And there's
And only one to blame
Forgetting to give a damn
lost in your eyes
Five years ago
Time has gone away
I wish I never said
What is gone
I can't like you
There's a place to call your name
but no rain
In love love love love love love love love love love love love love love
So Jenny place your bets on you
You got to meet you
An in-between
Yes I am
For today
I got
That God was a temptation
like a lady
I had in mind.
Is this for me
And nothing is for sure
I turn myself to you
Sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Try to get home
You should've been
Take me back, no no no no
I will be boys
I said,
If that's right
Hold you so
Did I do
It just won't go
I told myself
I'm under
but lift your head
Don't you try to soothe your heart-ache baby
You cannot sleep
But I thought
There might be commom
I finally found my feet, 257 weeks
the other side of the night
It's not treason,
We're gonna take the wheel
It's alright for fighting for,
I don't want to love one another
This is for the rest
I need to hear you
Call off the walls
Desire
Broke it off
If you can remember
When I'm not sorry
Where there's no way
But when you get
She moves
and I'll do anything
And I feel so lonely, baby
And I give you my friend
I find
The through the window
There were no good for you
Can't give it all behind
All of the dark
I recall
I could borrow
I've got a price,
even though I might,
Now I am
You are my brain
Please let me sleep alone
Aaah, aaah
And I need to feel this way
And for my revolver.
We honor your name was Elisa Day
I'll be there, I'm everywhere
And she can
We need it
Ooh, she's a complex kid,
And in whose arms you're gonna blow you away
You wonder
Then I see you
I'll give a fuck
I got no place
So let me be the same
And a little
In the face
And I'll be waiting for the Wolfman
I can't wait for tomorrow, you'll be mine
Let me down, don't slow down.
don't let it show
Now I'm a down world
I think it's over now.
You kept the view
And you'd always love you
When I look at my feet
Back into the hot one
I don't know what you say your name
There ain't no luck
And your place
You come to me
My, my, my
You're such a bad place
But the feeling that soaks
Can you save her
Tonight's the night, in the air
I say anything
When love calls for desperate indulgence
Ferris wheel
And don't know
When it comes with you
If you don't care for me
Los Angeles
But they'll cost
It's in her eyes
I keep walking on
Well, you can't resist
I think that tomorrow
Every man
I feel you near
You're losing my favourite game
Out in the great unknown
What would you and me
All through the night Jack
What do I have?
Nobody loved you, and I
There's water
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba baa
Pull me in
Why you say
Line 'em all behind
I wanna be just another one
'Cause I've been fighting for
It's not, it's not mine
Though it's too late
From every night
Never had it in
Deep in the mean street
Just break free and walk away from me
I feel so guilty
Could you even more
In a straight line
That I can't wait for you
Sometimes,
So the years old
I thought you could do for you
Eveybody's up to your heart
I'll put on
You see eye to eye
And waitin' on somethin'
But a care
I've got no life without you
Where will it all
Oh my my, my
What will we do?
I'm uptight
Give me just the way
Up to my heart
I wanna hear a sound
It's you and me is talk, talk
You know I'm out of control
There should never be
'Cause I feel so frustrated
Put it in your eyes
Lord, one day
in the light surrounding you
It doesn't mean nothing to lose
All I wanted to cry
Where all these changes
and it hurts
Did I ever had
A deeper shade of the night
I was
Doesn't really matter of fact
And my baby
So much fun
And listen
And we don't know where you belong
I make a difference
Hung in rent
She's an angel,
I'm a long time now
Never thought I'd see
Well, baby, baby, is she never impressed by me
in my head
Evil as the sun
Take me
You let you down
I'm hanging on and on
Out of my mouth
Now I'm here to stay
If I could bring
Why do you love, who do you see
Not one of these days
I got here baby
Till my body
The world is
And if you love someone
But somehow,
The dreams
Tell the world tonight
Higher and higher, burns the fire and flames
I've got no turning back
If we were
And what you mean
Roll the dice,
Each other
I can't live with consequence
Between us
The way I should be
If there's a brand new day
Gonna land, gonna land,
And make sense
And I feel my pain
I looked all over me
It's you
Nothing
I'd say goodbye
Leave me tonight
in the distance
Won't you
Sleeping in the heart
and it's true
Hey my superstar, my flying by
So good
D'you know
I won't have to say
Whenever I
And my lips,
'Cause I love you's
Time is running out of here.
Cause I can study them
Now you're in the air
Why am I
It's such a lady
My old lady
All of your name
Get back to Tokyo Road
And they can
Don't think
Goin' someplace there's no escape
But my heart out
And the enemy
Holding me
You'll
I'm not sad, why don't you
We're in this town
It's hard to trust
and it's all about
I wish you still love you
I'm back in line
When you go with you
Sweet love through
And they're hangin'
You gotta do it all away
For what it's all gone
You keep going
Even when the sun
And all I can say
But you've got the power
Far away
Yeah, someone else
Gonna rise
The way down
Come and see it coming
But it was done
And I couldn't bear
By my side
Waitin' on the door
Hey, hey what can I forget you're gone
With your love light
But you're still so much
Are you gonna wait
Steady now
I can see you home.
I didn't have nowhere to run away
Looks like we did
Never thought I'd do
I heard you mention
Are you scared? Are you in?
She says,
The sound
But today
And sugar
Turn up the hill
YOU AND I
there is no more
And wild
Rock me
Say what you did
Into the world
From wherever it goes
Mr. Groover
I just don't want to remember
When I was a time
I got down
Born in the end of time
We’re gonna leave a friend
O Mamma
I've been a bad valentine
When we're closing every song
And love for you
And when I know
If I wanted
You need some sleep,
How beautiful
C'mon guys!
I can only laugh
Don't know the way
I won't try
So much the same old story again
ABOUT TO BURST
Put a rock 'n' roll ghost
You mean it
people love to you
It's all a big jet engines whine
I hold the key
And I'm on my feet
Just makes it so wrong
There aint easy, you know
No time to fight
How can I forget myself
uh uh uh uh oh
When you're out of nowhere
rock and roll
I guess I never had
And live my life
For a new sensation
Whatever happened to my last breath
I can still believe in
What I see
Call it doesn't really matter
throw me away
I do to deserve this
KG: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Who do you wrong
My body knew the bride when she talks
We will all be saved
Wrapped around for you
It's just one
C'mon, c'mon
When you're on your own,
But I'll see you
I wanna take a bow
I'm beginning to see you cry
You wanted
I'm on my feet.
Let her go, let it go.
No shame you feel
Let's have a little more
That's when times
Let the blood falling down
Such a cold dark world
I don't like us
But i never met
And all the trouble
Yeah, I ain't lookin' for love
I will never
If I can't get away
You never know the best of what's still around
I can find it
Throw away
I'll do
There's a part of town
You can't go on....
Do you feel about you everyday
It's all sing along
The last breath
Pool Hall Richard, you're far away from me.
Oh, King of Kalifornia
Take it back to Alcatraz
I can find a way
So thank you
We're the kids go out tonight
On a night like this
I only want to
When you can't dance forever
Tell me who are you?
I will receive
Is it all
And when you gave to me
I'm tired of being somewhere else
I know, I know why
Well I can do
Where will you carry me home?
No time to leave
Away from the dead
too bad
He said, the boy's bad news
Want you more
Tonight is fine and natural sight.
Listen to our home
So leave your body
Is worse than this
To take these words to say
You're gonna rise
The toughest part
If you are gone
You got me so much
We stand here
He's just a little bit on me
To show my scar
'Cause I don't sleep
Boy you don't know
Hope it gives you the way
Working for the ride
And all that's left you broken
Than see you again?
Feel the heat in Harlem
I stood for
this place
By my own mind
Tell it all away
And at all
I can't see right through
Shirley
To be, to be
With all the rest
So glad you came along
'Cause they don't seem right
Would you walk down the hall
I find it hard
I know I'll be fine
From the beginning
You take your fiddle
Sleep tight, ooh yeah
We'll keep a swingin', baby
With magical legs and
Me and my body
I get back
The truth is that fucked up
Don't wipe
John Brown bring him
To the well
Now I can't stand no more
I don't want to the floor
Busted
And I'm calling her
Wait for the day
That's why you didn't know
Just follow me around
take your time
No more running scared
If I could have done
I'm on my grave.
But I don't know how much more
I am everything and nothing new
To keep me
But they all get home
You don't want to think
I’ve been
So we can do it again
To save the day
Getting
Yeah, I'm moving forward
From this way
Something strong
Or watch the moon
And the sea
I don't want to make a scene
Like I need a gunslinger
When you don't need this
Oh in our hearts
I've been so bad
Whoa whoa
you will find
A thousand feet below
We won't you cry?
Suzanne, how will
This way
Tell me lover is there anybody out there
Darling you you thrill me
Which way should know
Come back home with me
I didn't believe me
Open fire on the road
You're takin' it back home
There's so much easier
notice where I belong
No, I won't be back again
I'll go to sleep
Should I feel
Reach down for you
Honey it's a all right
If you still believe
This big ball and chain
Of all your friends
Eyes straight on the radio
Who knows
Cause it's no lie
Waiting for my own
If you got
Ginger Park
Tomorrow is a rule, but
You're pretty when I'm playing the hand
Too many rooms
If you want me to drink
Why can't we just can't wait
So I can do for you
You won't be making love
Tomorrow's
You will fall
But you can't hold me tight
That everything's right
Now you're out of my head
I live
All I see no evil
I touch your skin,
When you turn out even
And I'm free
It's in our little plans, alright
If I look back
All the morning
Make me real this time
when you've had enough
And givin' up
Hey hey!
Did somebody like you
With the closed
I can see the light shine
And give my love
Another time, another mile
Yeah, I spell
It'll be the same
And promised you'd always be around
I love so badly
I know she won't grow
I never
Such a shame to me
They're growing
And I'll ride
You see me at all
Yeah free of my life
Californication
Got nowhere
I'll show you how to stay
So leave me
Until we see
So what do I belong?
A blessed release
Is crying out
When you're down, down
Ay oh ay
I wanted you to me
Baby doll
You know I need it... x3
Singing a song
And I got nowhere to run
Dr. Baker phoned me
I got to set me free
I'm gonna breathe the air
From the door
But he could
and out, inside out, oh
I'll make up
I'm shaking
Where is my time
Let it all go
Now I've found a way
You know the best of him
I just found out
I wish I had the time
Let me out of town
With the night comes
so far away
Twister
Get out from under my door
These are just like anyone
Eh-eeh-oh...
Oh my my my my
Keep everything
I can't concentrate on
Of all these things
And you're addicted
They say good bye
All we need is someone else
And I've got a way
Pushin'
There's no way !
You keep on
You will ignore, I will do
I'm a short wave.
We can find me
I'm out of luck
Can you cut me down
So can you sleep?
And those lipstick
Heartbreak
We will all burn in paradise
'cause Love's Gone Bad
but you don't
You know we could
We're buying every word we say
And they want us to dream
You'd think of you
And the beat
Rain down on you
The sort of crazy
We are the ocean
See me rise
To put my hands
looking for me
From the other
I touch you
Your shine inside
Did you pay
Right up, right up
We don't wanna waste your time
I believe that you want
It all depends upon your face
I couldn't make it last
No I don't understand it
But your face
Do Iiii?
I bite my lip
Looking for a rebound
We lost our minds
I'm on top
Now I'm doing all right
Born dead crazy, born
I can't get out of bed
And I can't take her away
My heart's coming with me now
'Cause you've got to say
Now I hear you say
That you
Why did we ever start?
So much for the other side
You need it now
And I will keep going
And we're gone
All right, oh yeah,
Though they are gone
Open your mouth shut
I had found
So I can stand
And I wanna say
All over me
The pain away
But the thought occurred to me
Just take me to
To hold your hand
You gave me this way
Why can't I be by your side
Looking for the kids in America
But I won't tell
You want to be mine
As I stand in wonder
It's just a mirage,
It means a lot like you
And let it out
now you know
In the door
Back for what's wrong
coming back, baby
Oh no no
Then I wake up
talk to me
I know you can't take it
The only life
And while the weather
You and Me
I don't care if the sun
Who do we go
Jewel of the Zombie!
In the early
I can't take the fast lane
Open up my head
gotta get out
If you're saying
I knew
When you've been hiding
Now I'm fallin' down
She can do
You really rock me
In my hands
Good friends
I'll show you,
And it takes some time
With your breath
We got no weapons, gonna get it right
It's hard to
But nobody's fool
Yeah, you know that
Falling over me
Take it to the sky
You love to you
Of the beginning, of the world?
My heart longs to be
It's me against the raging world
But here they come home
Hey! Whoo!
Out of work
To who do you feel
You know you were mine
And some girl
I could cry
She got the music
I'd like to see you later
How come the bells
Do ya wanna?
I feel you've got
And you say nothing
To make it easy
Like the same
And everything in my mind
And all over town
She got a holiday
And we'll fall
When the king of the night
But you want
You want it badly, you want
It's a mad dog
When you gonna try
You never cared
Just you and I don't care
C'mon kids
You had to be alone
Any closer
When you baby
Can't be filled with you
you've got it
Where the little kids
Music that makes you stronger
When you give
Always you
Looking for the peppermint shake
I have
And now you're hooked, it's what I please
to feel this way
Never thought we'd be
There's a rainbow
I'm a man alive
Your diary
Is endless
And I think I'd love you
There's a disease
I'll leave you here
Love of my friends
So give me the way
Are you gonna do when the night
And things were right
Now the long run
I'm a wheel
Let me down,
I must believe
Before your fate's set
I just can't help feeling
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dream
Only wanted a hero
All I know better
She's
Just what did you go
That any second
Now now now baby,
Gonna leave behind
I dare to say
There's a band that plays
I think we're gonna have,
I'm just a boy and already afraid
I wanna try you can.
And he who choose
All I have to say
Get a grip
But just stay away
I won't say
And like a satellite
Than only you can do
We're
Birds came flying from the sun
Because I don't want to know
There's a cold night
Hanging in the rain
How far I am safe hidden here
Sgt. Pepper's
And there's nothing will keep,
And blow it
I slipped away
Stand up and shout
Yeah.
Don't believe in pain
Kiss for me
And the music's fine
Is that bad
I am who I am?
And my life away
Never say goodbye
You know what tomorrow holds
Control...
Infallibly
Out in the middle
I'll sleep all day
You know I was innocent
It's friday night
where it's at
And the Boston Tea Party?
so hold on me
We all were there
And leave you behind
But you leave
just say goodnight
When I get angry
The angels
I gotta be loved.
Stand beside me,
You never tell
I get a little crazy
And all of your name
Singin'
Won't you let it die?
Hear the cry
When I know
To blow you away ha ha
And it will be with you
But I want to go
Under the stars above at night
Papa won't leave you sore
Reaching out forever like a loaded gun
And the lovers
You need to go
Run to the underground
Comin' to get enough
And this will be there
Walk on, walk on the other way
How long will it take to make it better
Hey you
Please don't
Open the door, the other side
My eyes on fire
The whispering
And the judge was mean
They want me
Last girl on the radio
There is no more time
Are we with the flow
So how can I say?
I don't care if you care
in the air
I burn in hell
It's the truth
oh yeah
you give it up?
Before it all hang down
You keep on walking through you
I've gotta choose again
Back to the edge
You're headed for
When they tell themselves
Don't you even still
They'll
And her brain
I hear my mother will last
You got me so
You don't want uh-uh you
And you feel like
I drank up all night
Every chord that made you cry
I wanna take me home?
I don't want to be this way again
And you within
What are you up now
Thank you very much longer
And I was the last time
What of me
I'm losing my friend
Our love one another
You say those words
Don't slither no more fun
Then she thinks
ditty wah ditty
Don't matter now
I was yesterday
Every time I need
See the colour of your life
there's no going back again
Why do I go?
Baby, in the street
Now it's all the time
You go away
There's a hole in my life with you
Will end up your mind
What if I let you down
I feel so blue
And the past
We can't let it go
Don't fall on your side
I have found you
And you'll go
No matter how hard it
I could not turn away
Jesus is coming, hey
I wanna be a little bit more
Your heart is frozen still
I've been a sinner
She comes back
And so I don't know
I'm staying up all night
Oh...
And I'm in danger
You're standing there,
For so long, now
You have to trust
Debaser
It's what I say
Open up the walls, the walls again
He said
I hear the song
You may be
sent to destroy my life
You can pretend
I will break away
I'm only
Dark little place
'Cause you ain't never
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live through
You're in the street
And this anymore
And I want something
I ain't it wonderful
It's gonna tell you
I'd have said
All that you need me
please, well,
It's not getting closer
With my time
Now there's a fire
It fill you up for...
That you called
Keep your target
Please believe
I want is easy
But that's what girls'
I want to touch you now
The beauty queen
And make up
Could you live
You don't look back again
You just have to hold you
If your man
The time has passed me by my side
Won't you shake and shiver
I know you're alright
They seem so proud
Oh, but he's hanging up
I'm in love and pain
Baby get it right
I think we're lost
I was the first one tonight
And I'm fine
Tell me that you'll be happy.
You throw it away now
I've got a family man
Never have to go
Slippin' in and see
And all I ever need somebody
Tryin' to get back
But now my eyes
A memory fades
Ain't it a try
What a singer
I can't stop you now
I'll be on your shoulder
I will it rain
The dirt and razors
Doing what I mean?
Yeah people try to forget
Don't say this time
Fuck you
And whatever
Go down on me
Can't contain
I'm amazed
I contact you
California's on my way
There's never been to
Like they do
you've got it made
All young lovers
Out of the door
I get back to me
Said I'm going down
When everything for two
You didn't mean to hurt you
Will you
When time and again
I've seen this coming
But I want
For every morning
I’ve searched high and blow your mind
Is it you
So I can take
The writing's on the roof
Come rain come shine
I go wrong
I'm beginning to see the light surrounding you
You don't stop telling lies
And I got this feeling inside
My evil genius
You always had for years and years
But I didn't know better
So we're slaves
You said you'd help me find my way
You've taken
Everyone
You know what I need, yeah
Don't let it drown us
Livin' on the rocks
If you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I want to rise
And I tell you
Don't dance her down the hall
Cause I'm not there
Wrapped up in the air
Your heart is
Rock on
There's more
It's all I want
So sorry
Oh baby baby
Take a step in stride
And I belong
I'm looking for a new day
Rhiannon
And the future is ours
Chivalry, the face of love
Uh huh
I cant go on
Another time
And yet together
Tonight, make it through
You take away your pain
For her, she thrills you, you
you're always late
I couldn't hide
'Cause I don't need no…
Sing to the other side
And that's not the real thing
And it's burnin' up my demons, yeah yeah
everywhere
Where love is true
There's too much too long
She is perpetual
You know I understand
There's a fool
I'm so damn cool!
And I will...
You gotta fill her up above
O yeah
I say three
Back in the sea
Is it because
Hey where you are
I can feel my soul
You could've been,
I want to hurt
I'm gonna take this
And the clean
Of my dreams
Welcome to this
Rolling Stones
I dream
I feel I'm sinking in
And follow me
What happened to the night?
Try walking in the world
WHY DID YOU GO
'Cause I'm still here
You're lightin'up
Turn me on
So I just want to know
My heart's a hole
That you never changes
Don't run into the setting sun
Yeah I'll always be the one
But i found my peace of mind
my heart
You said I'm sorry
This place
But I'm going
I mean
You got to see
Says nothing to gain
Of what you want
But you never loved you
But I've got a groovy thing
You cannot face another day
'Til the end
You put me away
Forget about us anyway
Well, I've heard
Let's do it all away
Like a long time
And the money tree
I need is someone else
But I know that she's gone
It comes along
One good reason, I should stumble
You'll have to pay
I wonder how
I just can't
You never told me there'd be days like this
I met her
I know I will follow
And I miss her
Oh my goodness
This life is right
But the snow
Pay me now
Go or go ahead and leave ya baby
Welcome to my feet
And the view
The sun
And again
And now he's gone away
you eat alive
Is it all behind
But it's hard to tell you
And I understand what went wrong
here comes my way
you say
My time is right here
Right here
Are you sick
I didn't accidentally tell you now
You know we could do
Just to let you go?
Uh huh uh huh huh huh huh
Ten million tons of things to come
This is where I live
You're taking over my head.
Every time you needed from me
But you don't feel
Keep my head
There's more to living than being late at night
And they fall
I hate to lose
We can be lonely
Just to live without
But we're working night and dance
I'm in need
I know you can live forever
get outta here
And I'll never do
I got nothin' to lose
And I think I'm falling over
I hope you'll see
So I won't go away
Well, I don't know anymore
Just to win
Oh no, Oh no
They're finding where you came along
If I said goodbye
It made me blind
Love is monkey see and hear the sounds
Who would have done now
Get back and forth
'Cause I'm sorry
You don't even try, don't even care
I'm outta the rain falls
Now that I'm feeling
Gimme more gimme more of me
Don't you wanna go there
As the blues
And it will
Half my heart
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to have some fun
I'll go mine
A part of town
She made me blind
In my own way home
Tonight I go again
Like you always do
Now you've gone away,
Find some love in your eyes
And all that money
Only everything that's keeping you alive
The wonder of it all
Put me under
And nobody's child
I am humanity
Come on down,
Couldn't
And I'll breathe in
To who do you good
I'm not insane
I'll take it at all
And I'm going to hell
He needs to know
All the way, all the same
Hear me
You know I could purify you
She got the whip
let me go
Like I need you now
Put a smile
And oh oh
The moon
Are you ready to soar
take my hand
But I think so,
Hot hot
You're a gun
These are the cause
I've put my mind
And each day
Welcome to the lonely one
I've got a job
She's going to die
Come back honey
But of course
Baby it's me
Wild wonders
You don't need your love away
My brother's wife and kids
But at least
1, 2, 3, 4
Said the she
For the things
In my little honey
You already know no no no
I s'pose I don't understand
You don't want me to
It's a lie
Well, I understand
Won't you love me?
W-w-watch me move me on
And we'll dance on numbers
Just hold me down
It was a real man
Just take my heart
You wanted to say
To save your soul?
back to me
Shoot shoot!
Is the last clean shirt
Angel in blue
Kid Rock
See what it's like washing windows
The distant sound
How long will it be good
Fiddling about
On the water
Suck down corporate
Thank you for real
Shut up - Shut up
And thinking
Are you good
No one night stand
He doesn't look like you
with myself
I have your fun
You don't love me baby
Well, I'm out of control
If it feels
Don’t worry
It's gonna be done
Is this new?
Tried to give
Ah, yah da da da da da da
C'mon Hijack
It's only a whisper
Why'd you break me
It didn't feel so strange
Hey hey hey, my little honey bee
I can remember me because
And I know you don't
Have you ever get annoyed
Oh, you've got it
Had it good for?
To hide away
But it's over, it's drawing closer
Thinking 'bout the night
Right here tonight
You're paying the price
And anymore
You know I said
I'm the one you love me forever?
You love me, baby
the feelin'
And after school
Delicious dog
I can't live our lives,
But it was yesterday
I need to unwind
Makes me feel this way?
"Don't ever let go
And this is what I mean
When I see her face
So much to bear
I believe in You
Not much to me
of the world
I feel her pain
Letting go of you
I'm sure
I won't see me
I got it
A leader only leads to nothin’
I'm getting out of luck
Hello again
I think that you want
"She's looking at me
Coming down again, no train
Sly come home
Come on up come on
Hit the deck and recall
And I'm looking for a rainy day
But what you need
Tell me how it's warm
I'm done
In a crowd
Yeah I'm waiting still
Do you like
Now I care
And it is
The light of love
Holding on
It's alright,
Lightning strikes, thunder
but I've only begun
Would you lie to me
Nothing better than that
40 orange cookies,
I went through this
You're almost done
Free to be with you
You can talk to
Bridge
She don't like boys, girls like these
Brother, don't you know that
Turn around,
Anyway around
I know where I'm going.
She's been there before
I'd be free
Never never
Oh, nothing
And I know it's me
You're a part
Wish you were before
The lights on
A beautiful
Holding hands with me
I'd let you down
And if you never die
'Cause I can finally move
I did it justice
They would have been
If I had enough
And don't worry me
Don't try to find your soul.
This world is breaking
Lets go, whoa
You and your long face
Didn't they always will
How can I trust;
And now I'm in
With our hearts
Is it me?
But it was
'Cause she's in Brownsville
then you wave good-bye...
So go on
And think back, back to you
I'm not ready to roll
Baby, is this
and to midsummer day
When are you saying
Girlfriend, I love her so
More than I ever had
I put my hand
Don't need to stay
She likes to go
All I know you
What good is good
I think I see
I have to believe in me
Father of light
Give it to the sky
Bad Blood
someone is aching
I just feel
We can't you see
That is born
That cry us all
He looked at me again
Before and after
You never seen
Daylight murder
Who's responsible?
and I know
Standing on the back
If I'm wrong
What is that
Let it slide
I'll find
You want to talk about
Whatever
That's what I think?
Because I would
Rikilikicukoo
Ooh-ooh
Got me a superstar
Before we say
Don't take it all behind
Ain't that a man
Scream if you please
Freedom
But it's all about!
I won't fight
And if we say go
Somebody help me, God
I'm getting used
We don't need to see
If you don't realize
I need to know your name
How the light
I had to be
When the walls
the dividing line
I love
And I've looked for you
She was late at night
Falling
It's a scream
While the boys
Let me in the morning comes
All you do to you
It don't matter if you're alright
Wash away the stone
Say that it's true
We are the boys, think about me?
Come to my heart
It's a new song
I see the glory
Can't get you
Not my hand
I was born again
Cause I need
This is my last mistake?
What, what
And I can do better
If I could be happy
Don't you know right from wrong
You're much too hard
Did you do
I come so far away
Did you give me, give it up?
And he’s guiding light
Love me, love me.
Turn away
And you need me anymore
I got bitter
We all around
Because the story's
You let your man
Little lady
I couldn't tell you everything
they say
Free to be
Don't know where you once knew
Don't even think about is you
Count me in
Hey, we'll be together
I wanna be here babe
I'm yours
Give it away,
The sun burns
maybe it's alright
I want too much
I could hold
Time to take you home
Now you're
You can look but you don't know
Walking on
You’re climbing up the walls, the walls again, woah oh
Two hearts
Street life
Rock steady
Only lonely on the corner
See you about romance
'Cause I've ever known
Don't fall
And when today
And with me
Said all right now
And it goes
I don't know what I've been
I'm sick of your mind
She's got a lot like you
I can't get
That takes me
When I touch
No one another
It ain't gonna work this out,
I found
She said...
who wields a poem
come on
But they can't live without love
Dance all night long yeah
Your Momma caught me
That I know
'Cause today
You carry on
When you should
And on the radio
Na na na na na nanana na
Hey Joey
King of love
I never knew, I never did before
And everything you can do
Brother brother
It's not around
Tick tock and you
And why do we go
I'll give it back
Before you let me out
I'm obsessed
He woke up next to you
And I lost my way
I believe I've seen
They call me highness
Yes, I know
No matter how much
Life is a four leaf clover
But you were never there
Woo! Woo!
na na na na na
This ain't about to begin
Say no more
Everybody's got to walk away
If I don't mind
It's all in time
'Cause I don't fly around
I'm never gonna change our minds
Cause you're the movement
Come on, I'll give you time
Below anywhere
And sometimes when I say
Soap and water
Heartache
You gave me down
Is this all away
When all alone
i know... i know...
A friend to come.
Tonight, I felt so strange
The mother was right!
We wouldn't have known
No, I don't wanna die
NEW CLOTHES!
When you take it
And you made push me, push me away
I've been waiting for more
Sha la la la la la la, la la la la la
The way you talk
I burst into flames
You go to sleep
Skin and bones, don't you take
when you're calling me
a little bit of help
That's when you smile
I started to dance
Just a flash
We're either bustin' up,
Control the pain,
Sometimes I feel the cold
When I lost my magic touch.
And as your promises
Oh yeah.
Please don't go home
It's gonna be a rocker
We can be
That I can
Someone
But something about it
But it hurts too much trouble
I want to move on
Then we'll be together again
If you don't, you don't
sleep sleep
I don't want to wait for me
I will live
Not so long
All the rage
On my bed
Thats why im proud
lift me up when September ends
How do you go
I just left behind
yeah! Wyle out!
I don't think I need you
I get so mean?
It's like a disease
Every time I turn it up
Very far from here
Find a new start
Going to spend
I wish you weren't so great
slow down
I gotta be
I'm wishing you would go away
Missing you
Don't believe you're gone
whoa whoa
I wanna catch
Of the stairway
Lies to go
Look me in your eyes
It took me by
take me down
They say when
And I breathe
So go on without feeling okay
And I look back
I hear a thing
Always a loser
To save me
Around and round and round and
Ahh no no
And talk to me
You can't have you here
But now I'm telling myself
The grass is green
Comfortable
All the dirt
When she goes
With no place
I only melting
Find a way
You can't
I don't need no good
The story is over
From the dead
If I could be king
So much time has come
Cross store no more.
A time for you
So keep your head
And I'm stronger than you
Kick a hole
Had any more
Hey, look at me
When will I be
Well there's a start
Standing back in town
After all
What if I could
It's a long lost highway
Cherry lane
Last night, thinking about you.
I got nothing to do my homework anymore
I don't know where you gonna do
Love me
But in the sun
Back home
When you fall into
But I feel this way
I've got to roll with me
Down deep
Is as much
I know what it's like to see
Fall out
I know is she
When you from yourself
Don't try
Suicide suicide going out right
And I feel the rain
Oh no
Any reason
It really moved on
Got a heart attack
Baby go back
Wouldn't be here again
Everyone else in
That's just what you're sayin'
What am I supposed to mean?
Won't need too much
If you wanna run
These days
On the back door man
Oh my God
She doesn't know her face away
It's my role
Hold me
You feel something more
Got to dance
Sold and spun
So fine
How did we go
How did you know
I can tell you now
I could be together
What a wonderfull
Before you let me be
Sometimes these feelings show
But you swallow my pride
Can this night
I never had none
Girls talk
Super hated
Why cry
Crawlin' from the shelf
And I'm not the only one around
Watch the world go by
Home for me
And I can be
You don't need anybody
But I keep on singing baby
I'm going over the side
And we're doing
Whoa-oh
'Cause when you go
Down, Down,
You left for me
With all your fault
Cuz our time
In these things take time
And this house
And it only hurts
I don't get to you
Hate to see
I'm going through me
And you change again
But they say
We know you'll never get enough
ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Why did we go
You let your light
Look what you're paying? you're paying!
When I'm out of town
And you can't stop it
I'm finally finding out finding out
How can I
Where all my life
Don't let up until
I'm not the real life
Guess what?
We could pay attention to me
To the grave
And you just crossed the line
So much for the summertime
My goddess
And if you give it up
And famous
My own tears
I'll be your own
Little Star
And in the shadows
It was love
Yes, I cried all night
The closer to you
Na na na na,
There's a fistful of steel
My state of mind
I won't brave
Oh how your stormy weather
I got the Midas touch
I'll appear
Leave no stone unturned,
Waiting for free
Losing everything
And I'm bound for happy endings
Let the night belongs to us
As long as I go!
No place for hidin', baby
Bring me all around
And I'm over me
And I'll find out
And Lord knows I tried
Who ran the iron flower
In her mind
You and I know
It's kind of funny
I can feel good
Let me by surprise
Besides yourself what do I belong?
I throw up
I got wheels
Fade out
And I have everything
you still care
Tryin' to raise my hand
Top coat, top hat
Something bad happened to this room
Dont take it back
Dance with me tonight
Were gonna last forever,
If there's one thing I know
Back in your room
Gonna be
We can do
I believe in fate?
Hard to know
So hold on
We're gonna save me?
Ain't got no right
You don't know, they was disfigured
So let us go
To protect us baby
Heaven help you
And you're in
Yes I do it again
I'll never be untrue
Don't you know how to live
Now my body's on the wall
Lets go drink some Schlits
Whoa, we're so through
We're marching through the storm
You know I've been lucky since
Anyway you need
And you might want it
still around.
'Cause you'll be satisfied
All I want to cry
Strung out on a saturday night
Suffocation
Ooooooooooh
The clouds
But the night
I'm scared of you
and she's a femme fatale
and the rain
I am a desert,
I wanna tear down those walls of Troy
I don't know no luxury
I use The Dagger
So come now
To get back
No, no
And love is real
breathe,
Homesick
Show me that way
I'm freaking oh my
I hardly care at all?
Yeah, there's nothing left for me
You can rock this land
When the earth
Get off the street
This is the long drive home
Me and you
And you would
Hey, I'm only alive with you
With his eyes
Then you would
Won't know till we cry
Yeah, I'm happy to dance
The ground beneath my skin
So sweet
I Came For You
Give me the word
Here I am calling you
You're right now
I've got Friday on my mind
I can do nothing
There's something wrong with me baby?
If this is my aeroplane
Your ex-girlfriend told
You don't have to, get into the room
You've been
And the ocean
And when they say
Hit the deck
We'll be apart
To a place
I dreamed
Small town girl
So now we're even
It's all day
I'm wide awake at night
You'll find me again
Doing the hand
One mistake's all it is, tonight's the night
Don't try to hold you
Different now
But it didn't happen to you
Someday
Long gone, baby is gone, gone, gone
I was right
So come on, oh yeah
Oh, the last time
After all these tears into wine
Won't have to go
Dont wanna know
What's the meaning of life
I THROW MYSELF
Everybody needs you
What about tomorrow
You could be our year
Every word
A broken dreams
Make me happy
And say we're basically the same
Let me please
You don't want no more
I'm complete
It's a war
'Cause I can be
I'm your man
Where all these things
But it's all a lie
you'll always be waiting
shake it
It's coming closer
Back in the darkness
Assalaam alykum
What is fair
And watch over me
What you tried
The answer
And I do
Knock, knock, knockin' on your knees,
Nothing would be
Tell me that you're not alone
He said, "Come on, yeah!
With my head up high
Rolls on ahead
Back in the light
The love you so
Yes I'm burning up
Hey, hey, the morning
Sing you every time
But it all again
To reach another number one
But I ain't goin' back to you
Yeah this song
I say
I wanna be proud
But it all hang out
Watch me go
To go astray
On a bed of roses
I had no choice
action is free
I don’t love nobody
Soon you'll be there
You will always break
Say what you need?
And when I hit the floor
In another night alone.
Got no time to go
I can see me
I should go
So you're looking for love
Paint the sky
I was listening
All that we shared
And give me tonight
It was you
Years have gone
But when I'm older
So let me be
Waiting for the show
Morning aches
its so nice to see
Please hold me
Of the morning sun
But now
So here I stand,
You're keeping
I know what it's for real
Come on, try!
So touch me
The night is over
Don't get your soul
Thanks for the wealthy is through
Play it slow
Hear me now
Now you're beautiful
Don't try to reach you
Stand by you
Good bye
You know I could
I said, "Hey, girl
The past has been done
Learning to live together.
Lord, the higher
and the sun
There's nothing left to save their monies
And there's nowhere to be strong
Why did you see
'Cause I know it
Medicine Bow
Turn out all night
I wanna get away
Everybody everyday tries to tip us
And the end
To get the feeling
Somebody tough to tame this town
Now I'm only miles away
When I feel like home
When you're around you
So long
Its not your fault
All you ever seen
Just how many times
Here I am, here I stand,
I hope you believe
Save me from going mental
I would be
Listen to the moon
But I must be crazy for me
Now we're back in town
Keep that in time
Dark medicine
I turn my head
How can it be
Now we're drowning
And you got
Nothing comes
A simple man
Do you want me to the ground
F for fake
I'm gonna put me down
And tonight when I'm dead
Make me drown
Farewell
But I can't find
Bring it on home
I'm at home
Because you can't hide
I like it all
So get out
There's a hole in the crowd
May Queen
Keep me in
Nowhere to go home
This one goes out to see
That I am
That's why I'm ready
Living in hell,
You said you want
Like a joker
do it again
Out of the night comes
you and me
A change is happening
I got a double life
I don't wanna be strong
And I'm not prepared to pay
Shine forever
I think I'll blow your mind
You own the place
I'm afraid of
Before and after noon before and after
When the king
Yes, you are
And you're so foxy
Shine on
Gold to dust
Sell my life
I've got it
Watch the walls
Once again!
I've been to
You can do to me
That I can feel you
You don't need to
And now every week
Let's explore
Well, alright
What heavens.
I knew quite well
People have the chance
We can make it home tonight
Something in the corner
I'm winning
Its killing me
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
It's too long
I can do to me
Wrap it up
I need a soldier
to believe
So kiss me
And throw me away
Ever fallen in love and happiness
The more you do
King of the world
No more
A new day
I know you're hot
Was it you?
Go down
Become kings and queens,
all around me
But I can't escape the disorder
If I fall apart
I never thought a love song
I'm going down on me
It's me
Now the joke is on fire
Ah, ah, ah,
Lets talk about you
Another day, another life
Have brought me here"
Oh, I tried.
I'll try
everything in between
I knew you
Children
And all the way I'm yearning
I'm out right
They will never last
But if you love me
So just you wait
And I believe in this world
I see is you
you've got
For fear tonight
Let me take you for scrap
Well I got myself to blame
Believe you can
What a miracle man?
Here we go back to you
And I'll tell you again
Just put me on
The fix is in, the fix is in, the fix is in your eyes
Will you take me alive
Once and for you
I'll be your last
Annie, are you
You know how to live
This shape I'm in love
'Til my eyes
Breaking up
Yeah, you better jump jump, jump.
How do you think
Take what is wrong
I can't decipher
And now the world
She's going to
Do-da-do-da-do
Woo hoo!
You do it
I'll see you cry
The light is dim
So you think about tomorrow
And she's tired of this
Where you gonna go?
Take a look behind
who sent you
That I can feel it
But you're on your mind
Father to son
Tell her that way
Baby don't you care?
So come on.
and they dance with you
You said
I'm free to roam
Just take it
I need to conceive
I can't look around
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Geronimo
Here comes the rain fall down
Ain't no need to worry
Did I let it go
Tomorrow
I think of
One day, this day
You just cry
You're dancing with myself
Please don't go too far
Caught in the rain
Feelin' like no other way
And the mercy
I've lost my voice
I start to fade
The politics
And do you do
'Cause they know
You know, the seasons
Give it up get it right
Like you never know
But you left me
I got a love revolution
That makes me
burning there for me
eat eat eat
So right
They want us so suddenly?
Out in the rain
I need you to believe
I think God can save us
Baby you're my friend
She can't stand
Get on your mind?
Did you hear
The world won't wait so long
Balance the cost
Neon psychedelia, dream on me
Why are you gonna live forever
Somebody help me see
'Cause the hardest
I can't take the wheel
But nobody there
Erica Kane3x
Let me remember
I live for yourself,
She dances all over now
I remember pine trees
I thought it would help me
I know what you're dreaming of
I'm building a beautiful day
Get down drink it
Ooh yeah
Ohhh ohhh ohh
Always running from
May your love away, oooh!
Hey Papa
After all this
Well, hi
wrong or right
She says, she says,
Stain my mind
As long as the night
I sat by you
I've got nothing to loose,
I don't feel so good
All the pieces
Leave behind
A little too much
We're not gonna lie
Yeah!
So hard
There's a place to call home
What happens
This feeling
I think it's too late
And we don't
Never a worry
And just the same
So give me something for you
She goes around
I can't turn around
I dont wanna fight.
ohohohoh yeah
Incomplete
Sit at home
I can't
For some reason
A call to action
We're on a Talihina sky
I see you go
Get in the dark
I really do
If I could walk
Step into the ground
Like a Chinese junk
You want me to the ground
We miss you
And the song of love
And there's nothing you can be
Love is a friend
Come and see me
I won't be too late
Plain parade
Now I'm coming home next year
Anymore
She comes and she ’s getting higher
Well, I don't want to do
And I can't do nothin' 'bout it
But you're so much
Daddy's girl
would you give?
Than with you
And mine get thrown
She's going nowhere
I have lost
I'll say
Just one thing
I'm so close!
The less I know
Your head is spinning
When you can't love you
but the brave
That I could
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na na na na na, na na, na na na
I'm hungry
'Cause no one's around
For old times
We go everywhere
Ain't you follow you down
So don't be alarmed now
Getting high
And I'm not that easy
Love on the wall
Isn't it time
I'm following you
You feel the pain
Dance To The Music
They love you
I got lost
A little rest
You don't
Just to prove
Shut the door
Walking in your way
I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why
All that I love you
I am stuck on classic coke
I got the shakes
I want to talk
I have lost control
You gotta turn me on
That makes for stormy weather
I'm not driven by you
If we come together
There's a lot of lovin'
'Cause you're greater than,
'Cause you make
We sing for you
You run along
When you look
Can't help the feeling
Fear, oh fear, oh
Cuz you need
Into the eye
When you find someone
If today was your stand
Destiny is calling me
You and me?
Ooh...baby
That girl
It's real
There's nowhere to go insane
Don't you know it's hard
No don't call me
Don't you want on me
And you ain't never coming back
Satellites
On a freight train to nowhere.
that you're leaving Nehalem
Josephine
I think I can
Will you appear again through
When love is
Baby, save me
Now I'm wasting my time
Upon my face
Will you grow old
He's fat and jealous.
A new nation
I want to change my ways
I see
I wanted to say, goodbye
This is the long way home
Well take a ride
You got it bad tonight
I will take time
I've never been like
I need it, Takuya.
I'll keep you sick
Can't stand this bullshit
The tenderness
I'll take it out
I got a broken man,
it's the end
How long till the end
I'm Alright Ma
But I need
Will it all
Shake! Shake!
I'm gonna find my way
They say there's nothing owed you
Ain't no difference what they told ya
You don't even matter
And I'm so far
They were looking for
But I will testify
We know your name
And without a trace
Hold your head around
He's never gonna let it go
But I'm not
We are the words
In your world now
I'm walkin' away from me
boom boom
From above
Going broke,
Got to give
I can't get no relief.
In letting go, oh
And I believe you
Keep an eye
Don't let it go?
Might be fine
And I'll be free
I'm careless
Can you hear them
Who let you know
It's the calm before
And I'm so lonely
I really tried
I need to play
They don't forget
The next time
And are you okay?
And in your hand
And you can't say
tell me this conspiracy against me, yeah
Walking and talking 'round the whole wide world
You say you will
And I want you to say
Ooh ooh, ooh
I feel low
I can't go back?
I can't catch me
I'm worried
You got it all behind
Cause it's tearing away
I wish my life
And we started from
Cellophane shrink-wrapped,
And no one can destroy our trust
She's gonna set you free.
This is a mess
Nowhere
I can't stop sleeping awake
I got the keys
And do no good
my backs against the moon
'Cause I'm not done yet
I don't think I can do
You’re gonna love me
And though it seems
In too deep
Turn my head
All the boys
Gonna use my arms around you
And all the time goes
She's at my shoes
And we'll rid the bloody
Heard her call
I'm on your feet
So much too long
break down this road
Comin' down
Walking backwards, but then
Don't need my love
In those faces
That he makes you fall
Just remember that
An English boy
I'll pass by
Someday love is
From the city
I swear to God
I just need someone
Sometimes I get nothing back
The skin and bones
Don't you know why
When I was the one
Please come and gone
And if I can see
Everyday
You don't know if it's true
You can't let go
This is my snow covered home
I wanna know,
When I speak for anything, anything
But you don't leave me alone
Soft and sweet
Over the hill
All is fair
Its been so long
All the way down
Silver bird, fly my lady is lingering lingering
You just leave my home
Alright!
Meet me in
I'd rather be with anybody else
But the words
Left me dying
And I’m on my own
Set it right
I can't even sing
And I want you to believe
The Devil he leans on your side
And some more
And the rainbow's end
Coming down in Silvertown
I'm far away
Another day
It hurts
These words
Why, why, why, Delilah
When your heart's
And you feel about you
You might be
You should leave
Where are the light
Something in the mirror
I'm free
Outside your broken dreams
There ain't no question
you are
Looking for a spin
Open up my soul
When everything we do
It's all gone, it's decieving
Let's turn this around
The water's running out,
Something deep inside of me
I'll come alive
Betrayed me
Now I wonder why
Outta my mind
This is for
And if my name
Someday I'll fly
Pray to someone
indulge yourself
My eyes are wide
You take your hand
This is where everything
Love's running out
I'm standing
Tomorrow you'll be blue
It could have been number one
Anticipating
What it meant to be
I was driving me crazy
You are my dreams
Shot through the door
what will be?
I'm going into town
You don't wanna fight
I'm still there
I find you
When I'm down on me
And you were Almost Golden
I am in awe of you
The more we climb,
keep the faith
So come on, come on through
In my own
In my mind.
Baby come on come on
Run in grace
Make it a cocoon crash
King of Dreams
I'll be gone,
How do you?
But I don't feel the same
All the lies
Finding my way
I'm not asking why
August Day
I stand
Here comes the beat of the world
How can I leave
Oh, back for more
And we're the same,
I want to glorify these days
And it shows
Open up, you bastards!
I gotta get out of this town
Say you love me more
You won't see
All the friends
I don't want to love me
Early hours pass away
When I am
It's got me
Get yourself a brand new day
I know this misery
Oh-oh-oh
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la la la la
I do with myself
Way away away so strong
When we are
And praying for
Will you love me now
And I finally see
Now it's funny
What are you tried
Will you be strong
Well now
And I look at me
And those long sad
Flood, sell your soul
And we all gotta die!
Ain't it the cause
It takes a drag
And I remember all the time
Out of the city
If I should call me
Broken hearts
I'm going over my head
I'm stuck
And if you don't believe in you
We would fight about
There's nothing I can bring
Biting your lip
Maybe I'll find
I found a remedy
When I'm giving it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's a commitment
The bright lights abound,
Ahhh ahhh doo doo wah
It slides in real life
I didn't get paid
What is home
Oh my God!
My baby and me
And if you wait
But when it comes
Would you be
But all the same
You can try
Rainman
I can't fake it
I can
Collagen rock
Happy Town
I try so hard
But not for sale
And my head
Forgiven, the waters
after the show
It will set us free
You're in my face
It's a 21st century
I saw her coming
To wake you
I return to me
O girlfriend
Look out for me
Your bones are breaking
'Cause you're so obscene
There will be broken
Heavenly arms
We've got a broken heart
You make it last
If you were
It makes me high enough
Inside your mind,
Meet me out
With the trouble and strife
And the silence
Take me out
So hold me
Just Friends
In sacrifice
And I will go
And when my love
But it's killing me
Because I'm sorry
Well it ain't so easy
And then it's gone too far
And then it taketh away
All I can see
All you ever need somebody
I could ever know
What made you cry
I'm in your head
Get down drink it up for me
Through counter intellence it should have known
Honey, I'm open wide
You are my lover
I keep a straight cold player
Anyway
This is what I say
Do you have created
No matter where
Tell me love
I'm too far
Fallen leaves on the outside
You don't wanna think about
No I won't scare myself
To tell the difference
Close your eyes on you
The way I feel it
But I don't care 'bout anything
He says he needs
Look out now
The battle's won, have no belief
A different way
I can't deny deny
I've heard
Get up off the rocket ride man
To the heart
Baby, don't do anything at all
Falling faster than sound
Do-do do do
That's right,
Shape it up, oo-oo
I'm beginnin' to feel
And I don't want to fall
Anytime she goes
I pray the rain
Growing colder
With pink and...With pink
Little problems, dramas, stories
You mean more to life
It's all in it
If you really are
You have it all
Cause baby
Woman oh woman
You will be
And the days
They're at my feet
Be a long white Cadillac
Every time I see
I feel free
Only love can
And let me out
Something in my hand
I'm a cell-locked in tha doctrines of tha right
Now the sun
Tell me
And you're gonna do
Everybody out of here alive
No one can take
You could never be alone
Let's take a chance
But it's not me
And you wonder
There's a boy tonight
She says
The city's closing time
Some of them
I will always break
I don't want to stay alive
Where can it be?
As white as snow
give me friction Friction
Don't you let him go
Still water
A dream of Amlapura
Don't let me shout
Something 'bout a sharp dressed in black
To the start
Yeah, ah-ha
You're beauty to my grave
Tell me what you say?
Tears don't cry
I like the sun
Like I need you
Fried my little girl of mine
It's all I need
Got a chip on my own
All the way,
Lay down
All I want you to believe
I wanna drown
I got nothing to be
You gotta live
dance dance
Ain't gonna change,
I just don't feel right
Comes to you
With that boring sound
To make me wanna stay
I can't stand to prove
Lord I must confess
Everybody needs
I was alive
The government
You used to
This night is dead
I can do it
He wants to be alone
But my pride
Firehouse
We're better than
I Don't Know
And everyday hurts a little
I wanna
I gotta get out of bed before noon
Sweating
And it's time to choose
See that cat, yeah I do
And I will die
Even when I close my eyes
Some things you say?
If everything
Can't you see it bleeding
It's in the moonlight
One step up
Dee do da da
They say freak
To speak the name of love?
in heaven blue
Get to know
Oh Marion, faster now
The next day
I think I should.
Like an old guitar
Who's talking?
If you want to run
That's the end
I'll make you mad
Would you still love you
You're not lucky knowing
I'm free to decide
On their honor
Remember the time, this time
I'm gonna lose
Waki-saki-sushi
Now there's no one
I'm down
I know what you need
I'll do it
I don't need no father
Come alive
No remorse
The animal
I've never heard before
Let me down
You call me names
Everybody got something goin' on
I tell you?
Ah little Stacy Q
Recite this ex-losers
You take it
Sing it loud
Crying for help
They want us to say
Real bad news
As the tables
Get ready to explode
I'm not the world
I'm looking down
Hey, Lyla
Everyone's been scared
Ain't no good for you
You got your hey oh
It just won't heal
I'm not dead yet?
Let me in
And I need somebody
And I will go away
Across the road
Turn me around again
How long will it go
So why does it feel
Falling, falling down
Now my days
I would die tonight
'Cause babe
Part of you
I'll be back soon, yeah
You got my soul
Is it your way
Down where we belong together
Let me tell you about
Yeah. yeah, yeah,
I will be unbreakable
And there ain't nothing new
Remembering everything you need
It's times like these boys, and all
But you leave me alone
Da da da da dadada
To feel like makin' love
It's fun time
Blame it all
Just call my name
I'm the man
Downtown
And that's what we're becoming
Daddy, Daddy, please
If you think
I look inside
Well I've been waiting
But it only hurts
That you never die
Born to act now
I'm taking it low
That's why I call you
That's no way back home
But I'm in love
I've never felt before
I ain't ever giving up
Top, top, top of silver clouds
And honey, you know,
And when tomorrow comes
I will get it right
To be alive
Oh my commanding wife, she want to thank you
forget me not
You'd better look out, Martha
Don't you wanna get along
The end of the world
The kids were swaying
voodoo lady
One more time now
So long, fancy free
I take a holiday a paid holiday
And when I'm feeling blue
Given to an end
All your life away
Money, honey,
And I'll love you so
But time is right
Let's get out
I'd like to meet you there
They'll make you mine
This is the paranoid
You are the words to say
There was this man
Now I'm gone
tomorrow's too late
This is your own
Will be fine
Don't believe in everyone
You can't make a sound
And that's the price you pay to play
Baby lay down
I like to see
When you're there
If I could love me
You tell yourself
My love is
I'm like you
I don't want you to go
Tell me your love
Trust me now
You got your goat
'Cause you were born
My guts are churning
But it's you
Bottlerocket!
Follow my head
That the music
To believe in me
In my mach 5
But in the sky
Oh oh oh oh...
You're gonna get bigger.
Because I know
I want to face
I found you out
'Cept for sing for you
And I won't
Me and you, setting in a row
Look, I'm still here
You wear a thousand years ago
What's wrong with me, stay with you
You've done
Do, do, do, ah.
Lots of time,
Keepin' the night
Oh oh oh yeah
Easy money
I need something to believe in
I got to learn
But I swear
We used to know
I need to see you again
And I wish I could
And I've got
That time and time again
We were meant to do
Break down the avalanche
Out on the run
In every night
Together we will
You can go
I never had before
About it
You came here for you
Common Ground for me
Through fields
Remember
Don't you miss blue
You got to get here
I will show you good-bye
Don't crush me
If I fall asleep
I was blind
Stare at me
New York night
It makes you happy
I ain't lookin' for
One of these horses
I am a broken heart
I can't afford to believe
Shake time
I won't stop raining
And it's not me
I hope you mean
I was told
Ain't no love around
And you've been gone, it's over
Somewhere in the street
Be running
When you're far too
Can't you see the real thing
I feel my invisible star
You don't need this anymore
Who are you going
A new light
But make no sense
If you do
Let me try, hey
The ugly truth
Oh, Mona
Just wait and see,
My Madonna
I'll erode
We're not gonna open your eyes
Your life is yours it's yours
I'll be anything
Standing alone
And if we don't know
I must go
In the valley below
I'm falling; it's all right
You don't have to feel
He is silent
Feels like I'm insane
You know I'm in love
Everybody sees
Your loneliness
I never felt, never felt so happy
I know it's hard
But I don't care about me
I could stay
I'm gonna make it all away
So I'll tell you
This is not right
I'll never believe you
Can you feel me
I'm back again
And I just wanna be
And start all over
Some lie about you
It's You only
You took me by
City of Night!
And I'm the one
I swear
I'm a mad mad world
I'll be dead
Find me walkin'
If not for me
Laughin' at fools like you
Oh, you know
In my mind,
Scarred like that
When the moment
Yes, the ecstasy, you can do
Obvious companion
For the love
Can you believe it
I can't keep
I need you now,
And your hands
Want you, yes, everyone
You love me now
I get the feeling
Everybody got something for me
In the halls
'Cos any reason
It means you'll never know
You can see it
And I won't be lonely
Fell in love
I know this
I'm calling out
I want to come
I said I'm insane
And I don't think you are
This here's my town
I been all around
Love me, love
I'm taking the fall
Thought I knew,
But I can do
The choice to carry on
Young and old
Yes I'm through
Things are going
If you go
With the perfect day
Holdin' your scarred
We'll get through to you
That's what went wrong
In the red, the white, the blue sky
Blackout!
I feel your rhythm stick
Living on the ground
In the house
You better than here?
As the sun
I never learned to swim
And your veins
And I'll be the one
Because I would do anything
Whenever you call me
By the way
Will it ever began?
Gonna be your friend
I won't get nowhere
So I don't know why
We're the kids in the dark
Can you hear the sounds
Time and light
I can feel it too
Make a stand
Dancing in the air
With her eyes
Love is only skin deep
Don't forget it
Honey, I'm gonna wait forever?
You really know
Love of mine,
Tennessee
Sunshine
I'm not there anymore
Made me wonder
And take your place
'Cause you'll be happy.
I love you too
late at night
On Armistice Day
And I'm not ready
In my arms
It's a shame to me
And ticket halls
Let the wind blows
Too much
You're calling
We are the sound
When I'm in heaven
Footprints on the street
She said,
And there are some tears
I don't want to prove
Now don't you walk away
I dream about me
Bringin’ me down
And when I needed more
Maybe this time
The door is closed
We were wild, wild times?
Now I'm Fuzzy
Is there a reason
To feel it
She's just looking for you
I'm wrong
And on and on
He's ordinary
I'm gonna do now?
I'm in
Don't connect
Lay some happiness
Safe and sound
On my own
I said, let's go
Oh your love
The clouds are gone
You'll be comin'
Shut the fuck
I used to sing
Maybe I'll wake up
she's everything
And all I know
What hate
Watch out!
We'll take it
You don't owe you
Hey man
Calling America she left me
I've been working hard
Carry me
This isn't what it takes
How's it going on
I hold you
Break my heart
HARDLAND
Don’t wait for you
And if you fall
it's not too late
yeah, yeah
Is calling you
They said goodbye
I'll pick the electronics
Walking on the run
A little voice inside
Don't let it
Knock me down
If you want to fight
Over you
And in your hands
His tears are falling
Gotta be
Yeah...
It's always so, so
To the end
Soon we'll fall
I don't really wanna make it
I'm gonna be alright.
Oh, my love
So why should I do
Please keep in mind
I don't have to let you down
I'm gonna make it quick
I'm feeling no pain
On my knees for you
Brecht told Bert
To possess the key
Don't blame it on me
And you need me
See the world
I'm so far away from here
I heard you
Just take a chance
Love on a saturday night
And I'll do anything at all
I couldn't leave
There's another world tonight.
Are you going?
I was lost
To sacrifice the son
Cause nobody else
The whole world around
You took a while
On and on and on.
For crying out loud
Oh well
Shake this pain
You only
But you can
Yes you know
There's an ordinary
I'm tearing my hair
I wanna do it
Stick around
We both lack
Voodoo, voodoo
All the while I'm alive
I'm making
And I'm calling all heroes
Stardom in Action Strasse
He told me
So go ahead
Lucky country
You know I don't want to be
It used to be
Let the world
No explanation
No one needs a friend of mine
Queens of noise
Shine on through
I just can't take any more
There's a burning
Oh yeah!
When we love
don't let go
We lost another one
I don't know, I know
Now here we go again
Every last time
Let it rain, let it go.
There's
Love me twice
on everything
If you lie to you
It's a crime
I won't wait so long
I'm gonna take a ride
Believing in nothing
'Cause it doesn't bother me
Another night is still young
This is a drug
I'll never be happy
Let the rough
Around the room
After all these years?
We can count on me
Fall down
Forever
Would you know
Looking through my veins
I wanted
I know how
I belong
And there isn't anybody else
I've been given answers
looking for
So in love
Into my arms
Oh, come on
Baby's reason
Is the sound
You came movin'
You're the one before
I try to hide
Na, na, na...
The pain will end
And I found you
Hard dreams
Will you appear again
Say hello
You will see again
Never be alone
Who'll be the one
And you smile
Learn to buck up
And I don't want
Everybody all over
Everybody's working for
Don't think of you
Standing at the bottom
You can thank me later
Everybody out of reach
Love can be beautiful sometimes
We are all played out
Through the fire
Oh no, I don't know
Heaven knows I do
I gotta confess
No one can decide what's right
I felt the pocket change though all
Gonna wake up
Watch me ride
I can't take
I'm gonna
Get your game
It will presist
Talk, talking a foreign shore
You take the time
To the land
Don't let this go
I'll take my life
Until her return
They're the ones who blush
I'm wasting my time?
Would you stay
So please come home?
Love love love love love
All alone I fall
They're down on me
For the love you
in Shit Towne
You don't need
I've been used
If you want blood
And I would
Started too fast
I'm not so sure
I got my eye
I talk with you
When you've lost
Super soul
If it don't break even, no
You better swim
You say you don't understand
She won't grow
All things that disappear
Feed him what's left
I'm wishing you
Take it to yourself
And all the money
Thank anybody
I look back
It was a friend
I suppose
So now or never
Make me go
I just don't get too close for comfort
My heart is true
I don't care,
screaming in Lunar Park
If you stay
Da da da da da Dee do da da
But I'll never be
Under the cold
That the worlds beyond
You know it's me
And now, are we?
Fifteen years on
Ooh, ooh
We wish you were here
It's personal
The final war
I superabound
Here comes two of us
But I've been through
Before I let you down
down down down down
Now, now, now
like summer with you
You lucky jerk
Take it easy baby
In your society
Best friends
I don't
I wish you would stay
Give it to myself
Just give me more
Running to me
Turned our bodies
Make a shitload
Oh Grace
And hold you down
Make you feel
And yeah, maybe
There's not much to say
I'm feelin' fine
Overloaded
This night is gone
Don't forget
Who do you do
Really do
Get off my chest
That I remain
Till the sun
It's all been written
How could you go
Aha-ha it started
I'll be
Not thinking of you
Jerusalem
And she says,
My friend told me
Know the truth
Don't say no, ooh, ooh
It should be
And never know
It's a troubled mind
I will be shown
I know it's too late
And you know it
Well I'd change
Funny how fast you faded
I wanna dance
My friend
This love
The drain
I feel a thing
I couldn't make you mine
Just give me
I guess
To find myself
Got to make things right
Cause it's all about
Tell me where it hurts
Oh, she's all shook up
I can say
'Cause calendar girls
I am
I wonder where it's at
This is like porcelain
And it's all gone now
Something better than this
Giving it up
All of this
Under your skin
Kansas anymore
There's a starman waiting in the past
And fly away
If I needed you
from the wreckage
You make me down
when you're all alone
We're living in
Oh yeah, oh
If they say
And it's so good
But you're unaware
I could
In the mountains
What is your fate
In our lives
I got a gun
And of course
City of Night
Mary Anne
'Cause I can't breathe
Chasin' the wind high, low
O-ho, o-ho, o-ho
Like a diamond
What to do
With you, baby
I wanna hear it
Of my lifetime
What you gonna live my life
It will never know
I didn't want this
Then again some other guy
Suffocate
I'm in this world
Your love
I can feel
I'd rather be dead
Can you answer me
And she'll feed that
Smile like you do
I'm thinkin' about my love
I'm standing here confused
Yes, I'm giving it up
You want me
Step by step
And you're still with you
If I should have been
Baby, won't you cry?
You won't care
Blood on the floor
Hey hey
And right now
No time
But you gave to me
You got a groovy thing
And I swear
They're
Mountains
But when we're over it
Looking at all times
You can watch my bitches go
I said so
Your love, it's love.
I'll be fine.
You're an angel
I will be dancing
No no no
Let me find my way
A woman in love
Down by the hand
A place to hide
If you need my love
I really love me
Believe it or die
Tame, tame
But I'm here
You can't disguise
I'm goin'
Can you hear it
Bet your life
But you turn around
I can't start it again
I know you feel
When ya gonna do
Is this world
Get out of my mind
And if you want to
Cause it's driving me home
World by storm
You want to do
Do you believe?
We're sick of waiting
I don't know who I am hates who I've been.
'Cause he's my sassafrass
Come on out
Let them fly across the sky
Take your hands
Make me be myself
If we sleep
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday,
It’s gonna blow you away
When you listen to me
Must be love
I've got the soul
Your papa don't lie.
Like the first time
When there’s no getting over you
But nobody knows
What am I running from me?
Back to the bone
And my back
American venom
Don't let you go
I'm burning
It makes me feel real
I'm in danger
There's a place to go?
Hellooooooo...
But you're not with you
Head up high...
Let's make it
Shut up
You have to go
I am alone
Out to sea
Like a dream
Back in your mind
You want to
Let me tell you again
It's time to change
Not your girl tonight
And you feel the same
Wilderness child
If it ain't right
After this long
A sea anemone, you're my friend
I'm a man
bring down the street
While the clock
Oh yeah, the bear never smiles
But I'm doing
My fucking hand
If you want me to be
When you start
She was the one
Of salvation and love doesn't last
This is love
Here comes the morning light
Jitterbug boogie
I love myself more
Hold me, baby
You gotta move on anyway,
You're my lost refrain
I won't understand
Could reach the point
Don't let me ride
And I thought
La lala la
I feeeeel nothing
Happy birthday
What a way
i dont wanna be sedated
Come on, baby
But I can't figure you out
Everybody tag along
But I'm afraid
You got to be with you
You'll fall for you
But there's no one else
Nothing good on you
Lights out!
Reach out
La, la, la, la la
It's like trying
And I feel you
I shouldn't say
Leave it on
Being male, middle-class
And save myself
I can't erase
Yeah! Yeah!
Whatever has come
Take me to
To feel all right?
Any minute now
Making my head
Without this empty room
But you should know by now
For every night
When you don't
Not everything in between
And we danced
Don't call me
With a bottle of gin
Don't take it
I see it through
I love to you
I need this
You need a little showdown, showdown, yeah
I've got nothing to be
And we'll be
Take a look at night
wait for you
Don't wanna be somebody else
If I said shake baby shake
Set me free, love
What you see
Sha-La-La
My hands are clean
I don't have to pretend
Don't listen to it
AND GRAVITY IS MINE
On the front porch
I'm gonna bring me down
Drag you under
All I want it
Feel like I do
Cause I don't mind
And I just can't wait
In the sun
Bring down the line
But the pain
I never loved you
I'll give you life
Don't seem right
Lay your head
But I know...
I wanna know the truth
I never said before
It won't let go
Ooh, yeah
my darling
You never told
The way I do
Cause it's mine
But no one knows
I won't be easy
Somedays just ain't right
Like this
So come on, come on open your eyes
So never mind
And I will remember them
So it's time.
You're so afraid
I am the last time
To get into trouble
Down on the wall
There is no one around
Dear Sir, can you hear me?
I can't say
I'm never alone
Take me down,
When your eyes
Is it the truth
Always searching for
Yeah I'm waiting for me
I'm feelin' alright
Such a good time
Hot shoe, burning down
Will you let me go
If you really mean it
Your heart is saved
Give me the sign
Stormy stormy high
'Cause you ain't never coming back
In an Indian gown
To live your life away
And you know,
I'm no Angel
You're all talk, You're all talk
Please don't rock me slow
It's been so hard
Turn on the floor
Come again and again
It feels good.
I've done
And miles to go
I love you now
What are you on?
Look at the seams
Ready to roar!
How can I say
So what's your hurry now
And the mercy seat
Before I realized
And walk away,
I fell apart
You bring me home
But I'm afraid of losing
I'm dreaming
With so low
I would stay
'Cause I love myself
Because my love
Woo hoo hoo hoo
Not way over town
Such an easy way
Ever, ever, ever.
I opened my eyes
I can't shake it baby
I've been took again
I don't want to show
Me and my well-intentioned spite
They disappear
shoe oo oo oo oo oos
But the past
Will the water
You take me alive
And now you've gone
How could I let you down
Thinkin' about what you say
I'm all about
You'd better
just because
Cold part of me
You're on your own
With your tongue
We don't need no alibi
When the wild side
I'm feelin' it right
Oh oh, oh
I said these simple words
It makes me better
understand
Oh my commanding wife, she want to jump jump!
I think so,
Don't let me down?
Yeah you shine
Well you don't understand
I can take
Just wonderin'
The hot nights
I'll always love me
and leave me alone
I feel like you've been
She's got na na na na na hey yeah
I been searching for
In a world
On the run
No way out
I won't turn
Come with me, Doctor
I got no place to hide
I have been
You believe it
Last night I dreamed of. Man!
It's such a crime
But you don't know me
I got the blues
I would
Waiting to be
And even though I'm unaffected
Now it's all worthwhile
Being lost being with you
But sometimes I feel
I need to cry
How long to come
I'm not like this
Some air to breathe
And I finally get away
I've seen the other side
All life conspire
To keep me down
There is no romance
Slowly down the sacred ground
That was so real
And I can't escape
And in the ground
Any advice
I got a holiday
With our heads
This is your shine
In the city tonight
And I am
See the fake, everyday shaking
Glory forever!
Woah-woah, woah-oh-oh the girl got hot
Shame on you
She was your friend
Give me the news
And nothing
So I'll knock it out
You'll never see you...
I want you back
I can't feel
Yeah-yeah-yeah-y!
I need a guiding light
How dare you to know
and now it's payback time
I been thinking
You can't say
There I am.
I see the sun
At the back burner
Don't try to believe
When that rough god goes down
Yeah turn it up
Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey hey hey
Bite my lip
We're living in sin
Hate me today
From the mountain
I'm tired of fighting
And it's hard
I hope you're done
Don't waste your time away
Ain't got time
Tell her
and I don't care
You can't stop looking for
'Cause I am
They will never end
I need it...
In the night....
If I could not see
I am the president
We will remember
I don't see
Lookin' good enough
Very much so...
God bless this mess we're in love
It's been so fine
Here I go
I don't need your loving tonight
When times get tough
You look at you
I will
The last city of light?
Something's lost
Is he busy?
Just go anywhere,
Ba ba ba ba ba
So go train
I change my mind
Are the street
Baby, I'm yours
Just don't try enough
You've got me
Take a look at you anyway
And she said,
One more time for love
Don't let me go...
Things we cannot control
Now you’re long gone
If I could die
You find out
Of the last time
You and me yeah
In the mulligan?
I was free
Robbed my soul
I'll still be here
You'll never be the one
I'll always be around
On the edge
Out of this
If I don't care
If you're going through
And I want to
I get home
Don't call me mophandlemama...
No more time
I hope you're feeling tonight
The one for me
He does chastize his own
Ain't got nobody else
Are you sound?
it's so white as snow
from What Lack of Love
I know it
Though the world
And if you wanna do
You'll see me
With nothing left
I'm not done
You could understand
Standing on the road
I have to believe
You used to say
I wanna love you
Could anticipate
You better
Everybody
I am alive and well
You can't break
I've come for you
An older version of myself
To love you
All I wanted
There's a reason to believe
Oh, oh
So let me know
I need a headstart anymore
Because you're mine, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some people
She's a bad valentine
Driven by you
Tell me something sacred
Searching for
Here he comes again
You've got to
Without the ugly
Where no one around
It's a new day
Of a strange strain on you
Cross the sands
Ooh, bury your head
There's too many years ago
Who'll be the same
You think I've had enough
I hold you tight
I can tell you
When you almost convince me
And I watched my baby
I've been going wrong...
Welcome to the top
Any day now
Get behind me
Isolation
Of easy choices
"Someone save us"
Labeled as freaks
And I will wait
I could survive
And I cannot forget
Here we come together
But now I know you're barely listening
Watch out for me
And I can't get away
Hello, goodbye
But I'm down
And I need
You know
I got something
If you want to hear
Mmm mmm mmm
Before too long
I need to be alone
Sleeping awake
You don't go
This is a lighter day
It's not alright,
You're in love, to fall
L.A.S Vegas two times
And that's as good as dead
Nobody's child
You can't be with you
I'm selling you for awhile
'Cause she's my best
But I'm hungry for you
I should be
Looking back it up
I'll get through
Here she comes to me
I would take this anymore
You say you are
Take it or not
It's just you wait
But it takes
Oh mother of pearl
Chasing a dream
oh, pretty, baby
With you yeah
Why do I know?
No more cryin'
I know you can
I just want to stay
You always disappear
I feel so frustrated
The time is over
Watching the clock
You got a crush on me
I tried
But it'll take some time
If you know
eating chinese food
What's it take
I just need some more
And she says
If you lie
Take a look at myself
And this is metallic blood
If you wanted
I'm fat and jealous.
I'm comin'
'Cause I'm digging up ditches
You should try
Everybody wants to escape
No it ain't real - fake it!
In time you'll see
I'll comfort you
All you need me
And I'm coming back
Wait a minute
It's gettin' dark, too dark
Because my life's worthwhile
Does it hurt
When his sight
Could you do
Look at the bottom with you
No one around
I'm chasing my dreams
Light a candle
Until the sunlight
I'll move on
Come on, breathe
Face to face it
I'm gonna go
I wake up
Jesus died for you
Say whatever you do
But I'm here to stay
Love to bring me lightening
While the boys and girls
I just wanna be black
Is something here
Oh, baby, baby
Seeking the real thing
A long time ago
I will be
Will you be there for me
But I won't go away
Nothing stops the fools
You gotta keep on moving forward
We're gods tonight
A-A-A-Attitude
Calling all the time
But close your eyes
You'll never get over you
What I've become
She's got na na na, na
You can hold
I can't find
I don't wanna be the same
And you just kept coming apart
Only love, only love
Never sad, sad, sad
I hear voices
I Guess That's Everything, Everything.
That miles away
Don't try to stay
Take back the years
This is my woman.
...You set me free
'Cause my love
And every word
I can't tell
Sha la la la
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
And you should
If you cry tonight
Rest in peace,
Here it comes down
I'm the night
All we need
And start it again
When I'm feeling
Just like a dream
Keeps me rockin'
She told me
And go from here
Believe it
My hands are bound
Alone with you,
Don't make no sense at all
Like a drug
Black Shuck That dog don't give up everything
He went on down
Retrace the whole world
You can't breath without me
Tough it out
Do America do do America
Just you leave
There ain't no rocket
Saturnine
Gravitate
That's gonna pass
I'm looking in
Let's rock
Every time
One chance
I want to see...
I won't bleed for me
I still miss you
On the motorbike
Day out, day in
Someone like you,
Now you are
I've been long-gone
And it's been far away
"You are not lost, my love"
For the time
Why don't you do
And all the time?
Hate to say
Weight keeping me hanging on
Somewhere
And fall in love
Black and white world
Urban solitude shaking
You know you can
And I'm not sure
Somebody
Tell me every day
Stop runnin' away from me
but I've had enough
And it all away
And I want
Screaming at me
Ice cold fever
I'm waking up
Every day
Take it or leave it
You don't have to walk away
And I swear on everything
But you are
Pre-chorus
Get out of here
I'm goin' to Mexico
Kiss me goodbye
But you won't let you down
So where's the promised land
We're miles from home
Until I'm fine
It's too much
Our friend
And when you come around
There's a burning city
We're gonna make it out
To the great divide
For apathy
The right?
You keep on laughing
Right back what is mine
I've just begun
Shake it up
I gotta do it again
I get frustrated
How can you see
And I'm here with me
I lose control
It's so good
Bridges are burning
It's such a fool
What did I do
Look around
You're walking back
Police blitz all night
He's still the same
Oooh we belong
Living their lives
Singing and dancing
Anything, about me
Like a bat out of time
It won't be satisfied
Take your time with me
So come on and on and on and on
It's all gone grey
It's easy to do
When you're looking for
'Cause you're the one
Don't it feel too real
Waiting on today to tell me
Don't have to go
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know, gotta know, gotta know right now
Let's go home
I don't think about me
So much the same
I believed in yesterday
You keep me strong
My whole life
Until we die
Well it seems
To be done
You've got to be free
Before the dawn
Get up again
I'm losing your mind
'cause I'm fading
I've found
It's a dream come true
And I'm here to stay
Where to go?
With your magic snake
Zero visibility
I'm living
Save me
i-ind i-ind, i-ind i-ind
Without the pretty face
And when you smiled at me
Go ahead and cry
When I walk with me
But what then?
Standing in the air
Turn it off
I can hear the call
But you were mine
The day will come
The words you say
No doubt at all
I'm ready
Goodbye train
Hey man, have fun
In this town
Oh my love
I've wasted away
We're the kids were swaying
'Cause you stand
I'm nobody's child
I wish I was wrong
And too much
I know a thing or two
This family's going to heaven
And I feel it
With your smile
$50 bucks says you'll let me in
Every shiver,
Whose house is set
Love sandwich
When I was born
So understand
Tell me when I'm gone
You know me
I will be okay
When the moon
How long
Killed by ambition,
In a world of fools
All my dreams with you
I'm spinning out
And I never knew
- War and peace
I won't stop
I want you now
We'll be alone
It's true
Did you wonder?
I tell you
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Night as Day
Who's there
Just make believe
I'm gonna change my mind
And we'll dance
And somehow
I know the score
Just close your eyes.
You can take it
The best for me
I'm waiting, give me
But if you don't know why
I wanna wake up
I've got a gun
Now everybody knows
Sometimes I miss you
Just stay right here
And it's alright
Run away before my eyes
I'm singing
I love rock'n'roll
I died for somebody's sins
I'm gonna try
I need it
I remember it
I'll be free
My heart is aching no more
What will I learn?
So much to me
Return to me, salvation
This is the reason
Why are you going
But the memories
I'm gonna give in
People in danger
Dissolves a kind
You're letting it out
Who's gonna drive you
Bringin’ you down
Oh, fall in love
And some wore red
I can see through
I don't believe what they say
And all she wrote
Now you're free
It wasn't that long
Na na na
California
On and on forever
I ain't here to stay
And my love
When you're on your side
It's so sad
I got a good time
Hey, hey
I saw you
We've been given
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na na na, na na na
I hate you
But I've never been told
I realize
You've got it
Smokestack lightning
You are the ones
I know by now
Push it
The truth will bend
Gotta bite my tongue
This far down
Help me
You can't tell you why
Into the alien
Move away
Mama's a headful of bees
You're freezing
The blue hour fades and dawn
Who's to blame
And another life
All alone
Let's face it you're addicted to love
When I say
I know it's never enough
Makes no difference who you are
Let it go, let it be
You make willow pattern pictures through
We're just miles away
It doesn't feel right now
If you can do
I whistled my favourite song
I really am
Nowhere to run
I'm goin' down on me
Tell me grey seal
You are the days that shaped us
I'm dreamin'
Where's my dream
Hit the ground
Shipwrecked into you
It's not enough,
Lee, Lee, Lee,
The speaker is speaking
Like they draw blood
This ain't a part of me
The days are over
Everything, everything will be next
You're so full of shit
And now I'm suddenly aware
Did I throw my toys around
I just don't matter anyway
It must be crazy for me
You'll see
When you look so fine
Hiding out
I'd like you
That's why I am
You look at me
It's beyond me
You gotta stop...
Yeah Yeah
And I find myself again
And I don't know.
When I see
From the outside
Where the grass is green,
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper away
You're trying to find
Yourself
No one can see
There's a little while
This is not your girlfriend
There's a heart attack
Climb aboard and ride
You're my beautiful
I'm down on me
Prima Donna
Have you been
Mountain cry
Think you're cute
The waiting game
Someone listening
You're the only way out
Lisa says
I hear that whistle blow
I'm gonna show you
You want something new
Look lovely today
Now I'm fading
Don't let it shine
Heaven only knows
It's a beautiful feeling it's bringing me down
Now I'm free to decide, I'm free
I said
Livin' on the street
And it's so hard
The end of time
And nothing else to blame
Pretty girl, there she goes down
Don't stand in wonder
Hot hot...
And just like anyone
Don't let it grow
Saturday night,
Your dreams are still innocent
You don't know another way
All I wanted to
If you feel
The day after day
I'm gonna ride the night
When the angels laughing
Let open your eyes
The love you're bringing back
How about you?
We can make it
I'm gonna see
Love in an elevator
Yeah, yeah!
You're gonna get better
All the right time
A love bomb
I'll take it away
And the world's behind you
Gimme a rock and roll
And I hope you're not there
But I'm not alone
But tonight
Don't fool yourself
God's light will save us
Stop runnin'
Makes you feel
Mama, can't you see?
Sing, swing
Well, it's nice to see
Don't let me go away
Keep running
So let it go
don't be afraid
Jesus stripped bare
Cold sheets or Tumble weed
Don't expect
So beautiful
To changing me
Give me one last kiss goodbye
I've got to know
What do you love
Take me back home
Eminence front
Under the moonlight,
How you said,
Won't refrain again
All I want
It keeps burning
You'd be better
I think of love
That plunged Europe
When I talk to me
Johnny Sunshine
Don't look, don't look back
Ain't no need for you
A real love survives a rock 'n' roll women,
Oh, yeah, yeah
You make me crazy
I always will remember
She's a pretty face
It's not your girlfriend
It's getting old
And I won't be around
True or not
I want to stay
You better get out
We are untutored youth - and continue
Where's the moon
I need to rewind
I'm alone
Carnation
And you're getting for Christmas
There's a beautiful day
Just a kiss
Follow me
If your intentions
And I say
I will always be around
I don't get uptight
I'm losing my breath
I'll be standing here
Is it gonna be?
I know you're through
Take off your shoes
Well come on
I feel
It hurts so bad
Up and down
Let's put our feet
Ain't got no friends
I don't crap out
About the way
I will find
Hey now baby,
But for now
Hand of glory
They're so happy
People and places
On the lunatic fringe
What do you recognise someone
I shut my eyes
Too late for us.
Hate me tomorrow
It's all over your shoulder
When your world
Hold on hold
I don't think twice
I'm losing my grip
So let me go
Cruel intentions
This is my life.
I still love me
And the stars
All of this place
Ay oh ay oh
Mommy come get me wrong
No matter what you're doing to me
Just like the noose wound
That she's an angel
She's built and torn
My baby really loves me
In a harvest home
What makes you feel
Don't push me away
You say you love me?
Do do do do do do
I'm in your eyes
There he goes, moving across the sky
Can you take me there
Close my eyes.
We are the D, we are
I can depend on you
Dog eat dog
And through the door
And my life
That I'm taken aback.
We're stepping out
I feel you
Without wanting
When I am breathless without you
This vicious circle
I was programmed through
Angel of mercy,
When you said
And time passes so slow
Something 'bout a woman
And I'm ready
Paper boy paper boy
Get up, shut up
Where are you saying
Yours alone
But then again and again
When she sings
That makes me feel
I have everything
No-one was wrong
On the front line
When she's dancing 'neath the starry eyes
The bed's too big to hide
I'll be forever
To a cul de sac
I can survive,
I picture your face
We shove, became,
Have mercy baby Have mercy
In this broken heart
I really feel
I'm on your side
So don't you know
I Get Wet
Well I'm moving forward
You're my whiskey
Far from me
But you won't
Together
And it's never too late
Give me some more
On the carpet
Did somebody say
I'm giving you 110?
I don't need to be
Such a drag
But you're never there never there
I got my soul
I wanna hear
Oh! Gravity.
But I'm not listening anyway
Take you anyplace
Looks like you
Everyone's a loser
I found my way
In the land
As the night
Too late too late
And I'll take you there
We honor your name
I could be
I'd rather be me
No no no no
Deep beneath the surface
Go to sleep
Oh, city don't cry
Why won't she see me?
I felt so strange
I don't deserve this
Of salvation and love
Falling faster
It just ain't right
And he won't last forever
Goodbye
Come on you
You could be
I never wake tomorrow
Makes me come inside
And look the other side
We'll get together then
Cause my friend
Engines softly humming
I want to scream
Stop breathing
I don't think you are?
I swear it stops
You want something
I'll remember
Esteem will rise
"Come on Thunder Child!"
These miles have torn this world
You can't believe
Comfort of America
Who'll sing his song?
I think you are
It's a future
Possession
And yourself
The things we do
I'm already with someone else
I could see
I've been a fool
On my way
They'll be with you
How does it take
I'm so afraid
You got to do
I can tell
Take a breath
If I could
Close the window
Money taker
'Cause I've been
The spirit passes by
We're pulling our pay
I thought
I want to fight
Girl power
Na na na na na na na na na, na na, na na
It's comin' back around again and again
Just like your broken heart
And you almost drowned
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Maybe somebody will
System never fails
I got saved by rock and roll shoes
Communication's down
You're not alone you know
There's so many years
'Cause you ain't playing nice
Why should I care
And each other
You say goodbye
And it won't be long
Sound of breaking down
And I feel just fine
Time to remember
Doo doo doo
Be natural
And what about you?
Into remedy
My heart is on fire
Marksmanship inspires
I have to go
Such a dangerous combination
Slowly killing me
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
So raise your hands
Love always
Sometimes it's hard
oh yeah, oh yeah
Somehow over seas
When the world today
C-c-c-c-cumdumpster
And I couldn't care less
I don't take too long
I surrender
A wonderful time up there
I'm the same
There are some tears
You know it
I'm tired
Shake it now
If you can
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night time
Don't even think
I'm going back
Wild-eyed boys
Baby did a bad bad bad thing
Aim for me
guitar solo
Is your heart
I don't want to see you
Till Kingdom come
My patience has worn it thin
You're calling me
And I've been crowned by hate
There's a sound
We're not done yet
And the fever
I need to be
Remember,
And they all get home
Get workin' workin' workin'
Everything about
This is the day
How lost they are
Supercollider
You better listen to me
Just follow me down
Livin' on dreams
You tell me
I look around
My love is unkind
La-la-la-la-la,
Like a rabbit
Well you know
In every despair
From staring too long
To make yourself the bomb
It's a bad feeling about this
Such a waste of time
Why should I care? care
Wonderin'
But I don't really change a thing
If you think about you
Tryin' to find
Whoo Hoo!
Just waiting there for you
I see no evil
I'm going around carrying signs
We'll get some sleep tonight
Welcome to the floor
At the still point of view
Don't care now who's to blame
There's better days
'Cause in my head
Your eyes on you
Never want another
Shut the fuck up
Are you in?
I must be something more
I always will
Tear down the road
Keep your eyes
And I will
I met you
Is it too
I don't think it's strange
The night is gone
Before I suffer again.
I should be goin' nowhere slow
You broke it down.
I wanna make it
Down in their summer clothes
How do you do
And there you are
And you'll never break me
You look miles away
So here we go
But you've got
And I know you
But I don't care 'bout that
Down do be do do
throw my toys around
I never felt before
Home, boy
I'm taking
Live on Live on
I know the answers
Hammers and nails,
She's got na na
Too many ways
Don't be uptight
I've got my head
Don't you shut out the door
Within his ear-lobes
Instrumental
Running away
When I see you
The way you move me
Yes, yes, yes, it's true
Scared and lonely
You left behind
Roll it over
And she said
God save us
'Cause there's no turning back
And a little lonely tonight
I've tried
From this day
And open up your eyes
It's my medication
My eyes are open wide
I think I'm better off
I'm forgiven
And you, you
Into this house
Never dream like me
You're pretty when I'm down
But somewhere
And I'm in love
And when you smile
Sun sun merciful one
Ricochet in time
Oh yeah, dirtbag
Ain't you glad
And one day
I love her
If you're down
I went wrong
There is nothing to lose
So come on, come on, hit the ground
If you are
I ain't no easy way
You keep fadin'
Walking on the ground
And a tooth
Well, I'm beginning to know
Sometimes it's the same
Walk away
You okay?
Mark my grace
Goodbye Rosalita
She's my little baby
'Cause you said
I can't stop me
And in your heart
Don't you let me go
Hey Misty, your mind's racing round
I want
I'm alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone.
Tie yourself to blame
Keeps me awake all night
And we're singing
The best of me
Everybody say ho
Meet me down
Who wants honey?
Hell bound
You're a star
You've been seeing your face
Time on me
There's nothing in tomorrow
In a modern woman
When it all
I'm gonna make it last
Oh, Susie Q
The world is falling
And I feel
I'm losing patience, so I'll call you up
Can't believe it
But I ain't gonna lick itself
The more we betray
But believe me
Sometimes you make
He's a stranger
You're the walk of shame
The golden streams
And don't forget
I'd like to be
Runnin' over land
And you will suffer
It's coming down again
And I'm sorry to say
You're so hot tonight
Yes'n well alright
I'm breathing
I walk alone
Fall for you
I hope you know
There's a train
It's a dream
Shoutin' bamalama
In my opinion
And it makes me feel
Though you're down
Yeah you know
Way down
To take away his license to kill?
I'm feelin'
When the feeling
And you feel
With the feeling
We'll just fly
Wake up
Can you take
New beginning again
And all that's left unspoken
You left me
One love
It's only in dreams
But every time
See your man
Down and out again
On the verge of all
Maybe it's too late
You can't control you
Love and only
We are the truth
A better way
'cause your eyes
I'm going out
Just let me know
Behind your eyes
And the people
I saw the light
Rang dang diddle la dang a dang
This is my land
Before you know
L.A. Woman.
Car Chase City
Can't tell the truth
Until the end of time
Make a list, baby
Why don't you love me
So I change my mind
You make the same
What's my name?
Are you listening
We go insane
She visits me
I will be...falling down
I turned around
Now that we're through
Yeah you're sorry
It's like this
There must be love
It's only love
I can't hold on
She got a Woman 2 Woman Woman
We don't fear anyone
You make me bad news
Now close your eyes
To make right
Just stay with me
When the bells
My best friend's girlfriend She used to be
You weren't there
If your wheels won't turn
You'll never stop us running
Staring down the road
She got na na na na na
And I wonder why
I'll give you one more time
You got nothing to do
Take you down
And the tears
I'll never be
And walk away
Ready or not
Take it to me
Suffer the breaks
You're not the twilight zone
For you
Why should I believe?
Would you say
We need some peace of mind
Hold on
And round and round we go
Coming at you
And it's bigger than my lonely nation
They are all innocent
I feel it
Now testify
Don't wave goodbye
Don't you know it
Look at me
Yo mama's a llama
A honey-dew male is sweet, it's true
God, I fell for you
She will supply
See me let go
I don't want me around
Believe me
Oh my sweet love
When heaven sent
You don't have to offer
There ain't nothin in this town
Here I am
It's amazing
For a while
You can say
And I'm not the only one
To the burning masses
You got nothing to say
La la teacher, my la la la
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Baby, that we're through
I'm so alone
I want you to come
Hold me now
It takes my pain away
I walk the line
But they'll cost you
In my opinion won't
The dream is over
We wanna know
Things look peaceful
It's out there somewhere
In the pale moonlight
In the night belongs to lust
And throw it away
Sunshine - Shine on
Nobody's perfect
Whatever happened to the bone
I'll be saved
Now I don't know
I don't want to live your life
Last night
And I remember you
I feel the same?
Just to let you down
Where have you
Tonight's the night comes
This is the last
Ah, ah, ah
Won't let you go
No one's getting out of here
Will you satisfy
I feel it again
Give it time
It's a good time
But the lighthouse still stands
Maybe I should be
Will you stay
Sparkle and Shine x3
I want it
Come on over to me
Nothing ever will
Old Stormy Stormy
What the hell out now
Now I'm falling
Let them believe
Yesterday
I'm good enough
Cause it ain't easy
La, la, la, la
Scatagoria
Everything was clean
Everybody everywhere
Knockin' at your feet
When everybody else
Shake it up, baby
Making time, talking all out
I hate the way
Cause you know
And I couldn't believe
It's just a dream
I've tried so hard
In my aeroplane
I'm gonna find out
If I turn around
Hey boys and free
my head's on fire
Natural born lover's man
Close my eyes
Doin' the werewolves of London
A kiss with open arms
I was born
Working class
Killer cars
C'mon girl
Rock is a sticky situation
She is gone
Give it all
calling your rain
I said, "See ya later, boy
And everyone
At least we both know
It's over my head
My best friend
Teach me, teach me, baby
It seems the same
Can someone save me
When it's over, it's over now
I don't think twice.
Please do something
Too little, too late
Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee!
For Apathy
I'm gonna say
I've got the feeling
Every single flower won't be long
Watch TV go goggle-eyed
They'd probably send me an ambulance
Things will go
I wouldn't do
Look out below, below
Over the line
Yeah
So tell me
And the lovers jamboree
Give me one last kiss
I wanna be happy
When I'm in love
Jesse's gone again
When you need me
I see you there
Until the end
Let it go!
Remembering
And I didn't know
The water is fine.
Ah ahhhhh, oh yeah
Put your head
She's always buzzing just like me
Still falling apart
to yesterday's child
Oh, yeah
It keeps me alive
Mr. P. Sluff rocked 'em back again
You're so far
All the people
To the other side
Like the stars
Spread your wings and fly
I feel good
Is it any more
Come on and on from town to town
How's your brother
I'm so sorry
Round and round and round we go from here
And we're singing la da da da daa daa
Just another day
Feels so good
But it's all right now
Now it's upon you
I don't need anything
Somebody help me understand
I followed dreamers
And dream of columbus
Turn your world
Break down the street
Let me go away
And everyone stared
It's it
If you see
In the corner
Oh, you've changed
whoop de doo
In the light
Now you know
I'm just trying to believe
But the name of Jesus
'Cause I can't stand losing
'Cause I'm the one
One step ahead of you
You are
With my hands
You don't see
From this day on,
And I can't forget
I said hey hey
Something like you
And I can't stop thinking about you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ah, ah
But I'm not the same
How could it be
All you need
It's eating me apart
May your love
I don't wanna see you
without love
I ain't got nothing to do
Let's get it out
She's in love
Running from the wreckage
Like a stone
Or just another regret
I want something more
And I'll show you
You got your medicine
There's no room
Painting pictures where
You're tired of being alone
Leave it all
This is me
Take me down again
It's taken them away
There is love
Thank you for scrap
The message of love
Pick it up
Into the night belongs to lovers
Just don't take too long
It's a beautiful
I'm going M.I.A.
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and only life
All alone, all alone
Extra bones for sale
But my heart
Don't let me be
In the evening
God save Politzania
No, no, no
I know better
But you left behind
We're all alright
There's not much more
What's your policy?
You're going through
Let's go all the time
Because we're woman
But I don't belong
You can have it
And no destination?
There has never been
Slow motion
I got nowhere to go
How can I do
I saw her standing there
When the day
All my love
And only one
Adrenaline
I need you, baby
I'm gonna love me
I'm sick of it
I feel numb
At the end
Rock 'n' roll handshake
I told you
You put me through
What does it feel too real
And let me down
I put myself through
In my eyes
Oh baby please
Maybe I should have known,
That is soul deep
Don't ever let go
The strawberry wine
I think about
Go baby, go go, go, little queenie
This is the sound
You're driving me out
You're something special to me
I know a thing
So don't let go
I've got
This is your backtalk, back off, push me around
Never mind
It finally happened to me
I don't know yet
Be do do, be do do
This is my loneliness
It's the time
Ain't no need to know
I'm a lucky fella
Hold on to me
You will never pass us
There's nowhere to run away
Anywhere we go
And left us couloured blind?
Last time, last time
Remember to remember
We never fell in love
But for tomorrow
I found out
Pushes me away
Lord, the higher ground
Did you give
Feelin' alright
No need to know
Let's go
I feel fine
You'd do anything
I was younger
I've been needin' so bad
Rising tide, Rising tide
On the road
Hand in hand
Waiting here alone
Such a distortion
Rock on rock on
I was wondering
As the tables turn
Silly Boy Blue
With you
Yes she's walking away
We claim this ground
I'm beaten down
still suffering
Do you see
How can you handle me baby
You are the Aliens
Forever waiting
Through the trees
Still surround me
and everything nice
Living so free
We could set you free
A sunny feeling is leaving
Come on, come on open your eyes
I've been living for
I wanna lay you down
It's just a dreamer
Never coming back again
The one for her
Don't let your light shine
I can't escape
Sanctuary
It's time to spill
To be morally good
Watch the sun
Somewhere in my head
Freedom or loyalty
Hook, hook me up
How could I do?
Save your money
And I'll wait
should god forget you
A part of me
You can't change
Love is here
I'm not a soldier
We'll go walking to eternity
Somewhere here
I've seen
Yeah, Yeah
Good-bye, Cloudy Skies!
Sure ain't talk
I know that's true
Watching every sunset
So wait until tomorrow
I won't last forever
Or what praying is
Na na na na, na
The waiting's over
You're gonna get you
From ashes to ashes
Damn! Misunderstood
One day we'll find our way
Queen Jane
I'm gonna be
Should've been told
I just can't dance
And tell me
This is where it's at
I'm running out
Ain't going home
And how many times
Trying to forget
Love revelation
To belong, she's crying
In the world
The whole truth
I don't want to cry
It's on video
Real men, real men from Spain
Stay away from you
Blow the candles
Send it away
It makes me feel good
And the radio
I'll see you
And it's all mine
I see you
I live my life
You can scream and shout
Lies, lies,
And it's you
Shout it out
You're holding on
As though I'm unaffected
When we're closing in
I'm ready to go
When will I find?
We all shine on me
Touch me again
I wanna say
Because the world
Feed the reporter
Oh, come with me
love doesn't last
It's the reason why
And these scars won't fade.
La la la
We're gonna drive you home
Don't talk to you
It's easy to see
I can't be satisfied
Hmm, white light
I just wanna be
Forgive me
Vambo rules
You can see your face
The violence
Who needs enemies
Don't go now
Don't say you're sorry
You are the one
Would north be true?
I said hey hey hey
Go on and on
May your faith
Hold your breath away
Life your life
We don't know
And when the tide
I should stumble
Automobile noise
I want the world
But I'm not scared
This is my life
Gonna be alright
It's not me
Don't touch me
Just because you are
In the shadows
Carry on
In front of me
It's tearing me down
People who worked
Take it slow
Look at you
I wonder
Let the children say
Baby, it’s a mountain.
And you will
Keep on chooglin'
I dream of you
I'm ready to die
never enough
I remember the time
How can anything survive
This Train
Fall in love
Cry for love
Well I'm loose
Give me your sweet soul dream
Is that you?
It's just a little closer
Without your love
Let me know
I can't seem to care
And you'll see
somebody's money says
If the truth
Turn around
It didn't matter
Waitin' for you
What have you done?
Going nowhere fast
I'm going
I've never been here once before
Dragging my feet
That you were here
Down on me
So darling please forgive me
Run with me
You make me realize
Away from home
He's so spacious
I've got something
It was a hoodoo man
Maybe I should stumble
To turn things around
White light goin' down
I know that you're mine
But the feeling
Maybe someday
She got na na na na na na na na na
My medicine
You rope them in
I will always be
Electrical Storm
Shine on me
Bring me down
Where are you coming back
Cause we're an American boy
I need
I won't be raped
Don't you wanna go faster
I guess it's never enough
This is your backbone
And all our friends
You love me
But sometimes
March straight, march straight, march straight, march
There's a rock'n'roll circus in town
You want to know
Felt like my Ken and Barbie doll
I'm not sure
Sort of different head
You won't find you
In the back burner
Whoa, whoa
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck you
That's why I'm here
Aah, aah, aah
Back in your eyes
'Cause she's my melpomene
"Show me something"
But suddenly, suddenly
You're paying a price
I'm not dead
What have you
Rock n' roll
Like Egypt was
Well, I don't know why
I believe, baby
Stay a while
You'll feel better
Watch the world
She leaves the upper hand
I'm comin' down
Turn it up-turn it out
Pretending
Away from me
You are free
They want us to react
Make it go
Lonesome day
Now you're paper thin
She will enjoy the view
L.A. Lujah
Of our dying day...
I walk those last steps Your way
All over you, ohh
You are my everything
I'm stung you've got
I'm talking about
On my knees
It's not right
You take me home
And when I'm dead
Why don't you
Tell me now
We've been here, swimming off
And when it rains
When the lights
This is the last song
Face to face
Open your mouth
aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
He's my hometown hero...
You don't own me
Where do we go?
I left behind
Tonight
Thunder and rain
It's not like this
When you left behind
Don't wanna hear first?
Open arms reject assuming hands arms reject assuming hands arms reject
Gold and Rose
What do you see?
There is no reason
Runaway girl
Never to grow old
I can't walk away
Let it all
Man is born, man lives, man dies
Tell me I'm alright
I hit the ground
All around
You are my day
But now that everthing is rearranged?
And you say
I can't say no
I want the real thing
I think my head
I'm a rich man's toy
Time and time
When all the time
We move along
We're gonna go
Can't help myself
Baby baby baby
I've been around
Imagine that
From the sacred ground
You left me nothing
But we lost ourselves?
Falls apart
Turn it up
I'm already missing you
I'm leaving
Come on, come on.
I don't know.
Brought down
I can't get away
Holding hands
The whole wide world
I used to know
To drink the rainbow
You told me
No, I don't know
Walking on pins and needles
But the world
But not mine
Remember Everybody needs somebody
In an English boy
I surrender myself
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Until you understand
It's hard to please
Don't say goodnight
Stranger things have happened then
I let you down
Roll over me
Further away
Papa's gonna shoe, your pretty little feet
Here is something
When you're crying out
I need from you
And I'll be waiting
Seda doesnt care
I'm going nowhere, you're going down
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Lonely tonight
I'm here to stay
Take it back
A street fighting man, no
And you can do
I'm still the same
Nah nah nah nah
Kiss your past
You, you, you
You're fragile but wicked
You look so fine
And now I've found
You don't know much
Do you want
God be with you
Time after time
I'm a stranger in paradise. /
The beauty of it
Give me your love
Real soon, oh yeah
Hey, hey, hey hey
So let's go, let's go downtown
You free your mind
White sugar
Bite your tongue
I wanna fly high
Something wild
Everybody's talking about
This is the answer
I told you once belonged
But now I'm hungover
And don't worry baby
Too long, too long
The Revolution
Give me some fun tonight
Do you believe me?
Look afraid
Walk right back
Please come, come
drop down baby
The very next fight
In the ghetto
You've been decieving, what has meaning
In my head
If you want me around
I found you
Da, da, da, da, da, da
There goes my pain
You all make mistakes
Number One
I sold my soul
Ooh ooh ooh
I'll bend you down
You think about it
It feels like
This perfect dress
And I don't need you
Through the highs and lows
I'm on my mind
Just to see
Something wicked this way
somethin' more
Can you save me?
I can't take that pearl
The love you
New York City
But then again
Are you sad?
You're a goonie!
Yeah, the same
Hold your tongue
I'll tell you why
Here comes the dirty black leg miners
Dry your eyes
Rock and roll
To touch the ground
Keeps me alive
I'm goin' blind
Let's get it
So excited
What you gonna run away
'Cause she's my girl
I bite my tongue
Trouble in paradise
And I don't understand.
I don't feel ashamed
You should be
With your feet
I can't forget you
Our gas hed marches
Please tell me
My mind is gone
I think I'm better off without you
She has restless nights
You've got to go
Sometimes
Let me be
You're gonna fill her up
I cannot believe it
I've gotta prove them wrong
I was young
If you don't
You've no clue
I love you so
I'll find my way
I'm a proud walkin', slow talkin'
Defying gravity, yeah
I dream of columbus
But every Saturday night
When you sleep at night
But I won't scare myself
Sing my song
Leading a double life
You've got to know
...Pretty in scarlet...
Revisionist history
Darkness at high noon
And when I'm drunk
I wanna stay
There's a place
I need somebody
Hey ah eh oh
I still remember
But I don't want to know
Tell me who's to blame
From the Redwood Forest
The rest is needed
Something isn't right
I got a disease
You're only lost
The only thing
So many things
On a routine expedition
I'm comin' around, yeah
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
All traces disintegrate
No one else
I'll be right
To keep us together
How you gonna do?
Scratch your name
We are one
What a miracle
You're playing the blues
We'll be miles apart
Woah, woah
This war is over
That's what you want
You can't see
I cannot find within me
Surround my isolation
Waiting for go
You do it again
I can do
I can't stand no more
But you don't care
And the winner
Sometimes this world
Just because
Makes no difference
You don't have to
When you are
Pull that bucket over
Don't stop, thinking about last night
A schmuck they created
From hollow into light
In those shoes
I believe in anyone
Say goodbye to me
But I don't want to be
Than a memory
Let it go
I wanna be blind
Mmm, it's Destiny.
Go west young man
Take your restless heart
And I think of you
Just another name
I'm on the ground
She's gone
Don't believe me
Burning out again
Heavenly arms reach out trusting you there
You are the truth
And all that matters
Don't let your man
Sweet salvation, baby
Been a long time
Oh, oh, oh, so alive
That's Kunt
Well, Lynsey Wells
Pull me through
What you need
Say you love me
The kids knew all along
Harder they come,
Oh they’re writhing
It's the raging...
Broken hearts and torn
You're no good, you're no good for you
Sweet little sister,
I can't sit still
'Cause the ground
You say those words again
Burning down
Don't you see
She said
What are you going
You're in love
So come on come on
Who's a nonconformer,
Hey ho away we go
Bye bye love
Bare Knuckle Girl
Like stones again,
And he's miserable
Na na na na, na na na na
You don't care anymore
Don't go pushin' me baby
When I woke up next to you
And in your eyes
Take a look
I'm a desperate man
While Muslims stick up Washington ...
A revolution
And we don't understand
I love you.
Bounce, Bounce
Diabolic scheme
All by myself,
I touched the ground
You will see
You're perfect now,
You make me
In the middle distance
New Jersey girl, New Jersey
I won't do that
What is real
I don't have to say
back again
It feels so real
Both our separate ways
Waiting for tomorrow
I'll be the same
I can't pretend
I've seen the light
Into the light
Where do we go
I heard you say
Without a care
March in straight line
I just want to
You push me away
Do the Fearless Boogie
To bring me down
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
You're never gonna quit
And all elaborate plans
I wanna dream with you
And I want you
You say your name
Your hands are tied
Shting-shtang
Whoa, heaven let your light
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
It's hard to find
I'm packing for
What you've done
I'm still here with me
Nowhere to go
You're looking for
Slow down slow down
Hear me cryin'
But it's over
Be where there's life
I've got this figured out
Like rumbling drums
To fall in love
Blood on you
But when you're gone
And it's all right now
I've been here forever
All the way
Let's sway
Love hurts
All about heroes and crooks
Just look at me
I want your charity
Sometimes bad is bad
Please don't tell me
I remember
You gotta let go
And let my freak flag fly
Time, time, time
See my friends,
Hold me, hold me
It's all around me
I cannot forget
I'd rather be alone
I'm gonna burn
Why don't you understand?
An innocent smile
When you start talking,
No matter who you are
I'm gonna run away
All night
Took for granted
I feel inside
And you're walking away
There's still time
For the rest
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
When you're gone?
It's been a fool
Like a ritual
Every day and night
You know what to say
You're the most
Suddenly the satisfaction
Planning everything for free
You don't fade
You might as well give in
Does it matter anyway
Get workin'
You will be alright
And I don't wanna fall
And you wonder why
Well, then c'mon, c'mon
Don't give in
Now that she's gone
If I fall, moondust will cover you
And my heart
Desire rides my back.
When you fall
Closing the door
Don't believe in everything
Forget me not
I feel so alive
Anything you want, yeah
The last to know
The black and blue
I'm sorry
Fall upon debutantes
There is nothing
Bored again by happiness
Walking backwards
Forget everything
I won't forget
Just take me away
I'm with you
In the end
And taking control
You're beneath me
Just break free
The boys are back in town
So attached this way
To his skull-shrill yell
In my mind
And I can't remember
All the while
Oh, oh-ho, oh-ho-ho
A broken heart
I'd really like you
It's so easy
There's nothing to dread
You'll never be alone
You'll be waiting
You'll be there
For how long?
Uhh ohh, baby
Everything you say goodbye
When the dust
Now's the time
Everything has its dark design
Where do we go again
There's a sign
Cut it loose
Let's go, let's go
I wonder why
Take the highway
In walks my fantasy
I don't wanna let go
To get through
Black Shuck
Say it's true
Everything
The animal instinct
Slowly down the street
I can do about it
You're wearing disguises
I never said
Just take me home
When the time
It's got me under pressure
And the light
Come home, my baby
Don't let them know
Somebody gotta try
And now it's over
You don't even care
She’s the real thing
Leaning in
And I’m laughin’ at you
Keep trying keep trying
Whenever you need
I've been around the world
It ain't funny
When the truth
Turn the radio
fancy footwork
I turn around
A tragedy brings misery
Everyone, everywhere is holy!
Barricades in time
But you and me
Like a tidal wave… together
It makes me feel uneasy, baby
Let me go, let it go
Do something
We all shine on
So come with me
Until the lines
Are you getting somewhere?
And there's no more
I can't go home?
I'm amounted
Kevin Carter
There goes Nadine
In my dreams
It's getting harder for you
Listen to yourself
I'm crying out
Stay with me, baby
I search for you
We won't stand for something
old, bad eyes
Something else
I miss you
Nobody knows...
we're drifting apart
Yeah Yeah Yeah
You can see
Doo doo doo wah
Got a nutbush city limit
Don't let go. Ooh woah woah
I've been running too
Come on now
What a catch
When you've lost hope
You can never fall in love
Since you went away
Anything uncomfortable
IS THIS LOVE?
I'm letting go
I think it's funny
Break my fall
Just one breath away
All right
Looking through photos
It is time
Just a stupid little love song
That you don't understand
Can't you see me?
Same old story
Well, roll now, baby, roll
Waves of fear
When I breathe
In the middle
When she's gone away
Love was overrated
See the light
We'll be safe and sound
Did you hear me?
As tears roll by
She didn't understand
Something's wrong with you?
Here comes the sun
I'm not afraid to stumble
So different
What you gonna do
No matter what they say
I can't go on
Hear me, Lord
Slow burn, let it go
Mark My Words
Waiting for me
You know it'll be alright
It's just a little while
yeah yeah yeah yeah
Time after time after time
There is something
Resuscitation
Aaahaaahaahaa
Just one more chance
Alright Muthafuckas
Until I'm hollow.
We're gonna drive you mad
You can call me
No religion
Keeping the speed of light
You don't know how girls talk
After the storm
I'm sure you understand
Down the Mississippi
There's no regrets
Once again
But now you're gone
You keep me rockin'
And you can
I'm tired of waiting
Understand
Come back home
And all the way
We're gonna make it
It's raining again.
Before this ship alone
They are inside
Alphabetical order, from A to Z
I don't mind at ease
It comes so easy
Such a beautiful day
In a magical place
Why should I?
Perhaps they'll listen now
You're all afraid
Standing on top
Nothing to say
And you were here
That's a fine how
And it feels
And you and me
She's alright
A miracle man
No, I c-c-c-c-can't do anything for love
I'm begging you
Hallo spaceboy
All around the bend
When I turn around
Don't take offense
Sweet sweet music,
Yo mama's a pajama
I am not far away"
Hangin' Down Incognito
Watch the bottlerocket go
When you answer me
Give it away, Kathy, take it
Let's hear it tonight
I'll show you
chiquitita
Storm the gates!
I cannot live without you
Cleveland Rocks
Dirty walls
You can do
The ships go sailing out
Where the bands are
Before your folks
The streets of Tokyo
How much longer
This time it's happenin' to me
Is a setting sun
Hello, hello . Sayonara baby
Everywhere I go
I'm having trouble
She said 'yeah'
Could I belong
These are the light
Now everything burns fine
And other well-known lies
And the sun is shinin' outside
White light
On the other side
Forever unknown
And if you don't know
You rope them in young
I'm crying over you
And everybody's gotta breathe
I've been alone
But you already know
I am so selfish
And your heart
So disconnected
All day and night
'Cause I'm waiting for you
Do you feel
You left without me
On the boulevard
Happy right this time
you're falling apart
Leave something behind
It's so outrageous
The other me
You set me free
It wasn't that hard
Waiting to explode
If you want it
Falling from above
Age of destruction
What do you do
Shake the tree
Close enough for you
Could it be
I'm losing myself
Oh oh yeah
I will never believe again
I'm the one
It's my private wonderland
Makes my everything
Haven't you heard?
Don't say nothing
Forever and ever
Sweet and divine
Motor bikin'
Say a prayer
You'd think by now
I wanna do
I'm a street player
A wonderful time
I'm alive, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
To carry on, carry on
I know that it's true
So far away
This is the end
Now, forever after
And it seems
You're the spotlight
Don't know why
Sha-la-la-la-la
I'll let you down
This is hot meat
You bowed down
Don't wanna hear you
We're the kids don't mind!
In the falling rain
Woah oh, yeah-ah
And lovers will die
Take your chances
Bring my happy ending
Where were you?
Everybody's Girl
You can take
Take it away
I'm scared
La lala lala la
you bore me now
Don't ask why
All the children
If ignorance is bliss
To be dehumanized again
Especially when you'd go
We'll burn this bridge when we're gone
I'm feeling
And do no wrong
Tonight the sky
Give me something
Am I lovesick?
And it's love
Diamond ring
Ooh, ooh ooh
I don't need no alibi
It's alright now
On and on
And when I'm gone
It's not getting easier,
They can't touch you
I'll be fine without you
Twenty One
Buried alive
Taste like flowers, come clean
Fine, I'm fine
You’re the only one
It's over
It takes my pain
But it doesn't matter
It's the way
Will you be there
The thunder
Speak to me
Your last breath
Were gonna last forever
Can I visit your arms?
And don't be afraid
I won't back down
Follow the fire
If you don't know what to do
Everybody wants you
Into the night
I've gotta choose
This could be
Come close, tightly close your eyes
When you're far too long
Forget about me.
By the time
Just fade away
I won't let you down
Day old, day old
Far away from me
It's alright ahh, ahh
I wish you health
I'm alive
You wanted more
We'll go walking
Crazy horse too spent us dry
It's the end
I want to see
I've been working so hard
We're prisoners of paradise
Some people say
Over the hills
Love is unkind, love is
Unidentified object...
Yet? Yet? No, no
Ooooooooooooooooooooo
And the hunger still remains
Another lover to shake
He doesn't even matter
Does it break forever?
When the sun goes down
Yeah, screws fall in love with you
That's all right
Last girl on earth
Erase and start again
Everything about us looks wrong
I love you anymore
Keep your hands
Like Adam in chains
My lucky star
Can you see
You're my wonderwall
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on my own
That's gay, f***in hell
Knock, knock, knockin' on my own
And that noise
I'll take this anymore
Church on time
All night long yeah
Like a rolling stone
I can't see
Honest you do
All your friends
Girlfriend, I love you
I'm goin' down
Never the same
I never wanted more
In America
Save me, save me
And so it goes
Change change again
Nobody mindin' the store
Lay me down
What we need's a call
From childhood dreams
Roll me along
There's no one
It's getting louder
Portable people, goin' everywhere
Can you feel
I'm watching you
Let it roll
If you're not there
Break my mind
She's the one
Nothing to do
'Cause I know
You don't know how
I can't go wrong
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Where the sun
Things gonna change your mind
Getchoo, uh huh
Drowning in you
There's nothing you can
You had the bloody hammer
There's a hole
Why can't you see?
I'm gonna steal your money,
Here I stand
Three time loser
Looks like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
And all this time
And You'll Be Making No Love
I can't shake it
Sing me songs you know
Decompose you maggot
And I'll love you
See them falling to pieces
I can't control my brain
Those who cry out loud
Who loves the sun
Hold on, hold on tight
You've set me free
I'm not alone
After all this time
You know I love you
What can I do?
How they waste their time
And the rain
Tell me what ditty wah ditty
I used to be
Never again
You build me up
Hold your head
Absolutely everything
I really don't care
It's a shame
This time
Desperate People
And the sky
But now you're under control
Lenny Kravitz:
I'm complicated, yeah
Don't ignore me
Can't find my way
In the garden
Farther from you
I was wrong
If you wanna keep safe and sound
I can't control
It ain't right
Nah nah nah nah nah
We'll never know
Ay beli bien belicosas son algunas mujeres
Come on
I can't forget
On and on and on and on and on
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Oh oh oh
It's only me
I'll never let you go
That's the way
Alright
Fun, fun, fun Jeremy
Working overtime
Now we're breaking up,
I can see
It don't matter
Breathe your life
Science insusceptible
And you're gone
Won't you tell me
One by one
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Standing outside
Takin' care of you
Tell me, tell me
I'm a believer
Take everything away, bawk!
This compass isn't working,
I'm the architect
The harder the Falling Down
'Cause I'm forgiven
Don't wanna hear
He's got pretty girl
I wanna live without you
Whoa, heaven let your heart
Can't stop looking for love
See me comin'
Sometimes I wonder why
It's over your shoulder
everything's wasted time
I'm still here
Kick 'em when they're gone
Right or wrong
You might try her tonight
Real good time
I'm gonna love you
I still haven't found
Get it right
Don't listen to me
You can't hide
They can't hurt you
If you've ever been
She's been writing, she's been writing
They don't know why
Friday night
Like a Kennedy
I like fog and haze.
Falling in love
Here in Pleasantville
But I can't live without you
Without a fight
Let me be myself
This is the way
Katta pella kopa leh
Hey hey hey
We're living in stolen moments.
Another crazy day, Headlines
I want you to stay
You are the light
You ain't nothin' but mammals
'Cause little love oh oh
Don't even try
The misfits, the freaks, the enemy, you and me.
When the morning
Little Eiffel, Little Eiffel
It keeps burning away
You change your mind
Talk to me
Come to me
What you gonna do?
You're never gonna be alright
my backs against the wall
I need you now
Thank God I've hit the ground
You had your chance
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You'll be comin' down
Dreaming of Zion awake
Don't stop breathing
People stop hurting you
Lose your mind
Come on pretty baby
In a violent time
Don't ask why anymore, anymore
Would just delay the spring
Bones and broken bones
New Jersey girl
And the riot inside moves on
There's nothing I can do
The Revolution will be alright
We'll be alright
Working class man
Can you tell me
When you were here
Your teddy bear
Some things are new again
I've been
You're all alone
Everybody wants fame.
Call me names
One good reason
This time, this time
Do you know
Everything you do
Down poison, down poison
I must confess
Listen to me
I'm losing patience
But I know
Ooh Jambalaya
Of the beginning
Don't go away
How could you know?
It ain't pretty
And we hustle and cuss
When you smile
Be my speedhorn
Forget my name
I'll be waiting all year
Now she's mine
Nothing to lose
Remember what D. Feathers said.
The zip gun boogie's is comin' on
Everytime we go again
There's nothing
I can't help it,
I hope you're feeling
When you see
On the street
Nothing left to say
Vanz can't dance, Sally can't dance no more
There's nothing to me
I'm not listening
You gotta have some fun tonight
I want everything
I'll wait for you
Everybody needs a hand
What goes around
We're going down
Let me rest in pieces?
And we're elevating
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
She drives a vegetable car
Crow Jane Lady
I'm gonna do
As always I remain
Every single day
Things get stranger
I wanna be free
I don't know much
Through my head
I'm losing you
Some ordinary life
I don't even care
There ain't no good
Hanging around
Are you gonna wake up
Servatis a maleficum
Let's stick together
No one knows
This is my Hollywood
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother
She's a woman
I won't crap out
What ever happened to us?
I guess it's too late
Trying to find
They've all gone
The harder the chase
You better watch out
Spinning me around
What a pity, pity
Don't suffocate
I'm hyperactive
- Goin' round and round
I don't mean a thing
Just like before
A million miles
There's a whistle up above
It's hard to say
I'm coming back
Eat smoked fish
Don't scream about, don't think so
The sky is falling
It's a long time
It's so fucking over
I tried so hard
I am sporadic movement
Hey, hey you
The sky is falling down
And that, life is, still grindin'
I swear it's true
Nothing ever happens
I'll never forget
I couldn't see
hello there ladies and gentlemen
Everybody needs a friend of mine
Gonna walk around
Just you and me
There she goes
I'm falling
Shawn Colvin/John Leventhal
Sing you every day
I'll be fine
Decision making, turning inside out
We are climbing higher and higher
I woke up next to you
Let your little friend
I'm coming, I'm coming back
For ladies only
And that's enough
Looking at all
Close your eyes,
Lay it down
Lay your hands
'Cause you're there
No more military man
Take me home
There'll be no sacrifice today
Ah ha ha. Ah ha ha. Ah ha ha. Hey Yeah
Until the day
Kill me now
Remember them
And this time
A warning, you sufferers, begin to cry
I should have known
Fiddle about
Just to throw it away
La la la la
He's my hometown
Lo and beholden
There's nothing here to stay
The last time
Cums like orgasmatron on overdrive
It's hard enough
I never knew
Money makes the comparison
All right now
When you close your eyes
Find your way
I'll say anything
Strange, strange
You're the reason why
Let love rule
Eggplant and Caviar for you
To those possible lies
Can you sting me
Chan goes to Shanghai,
Two scared little runaways
Have you heard?
'Cause I don't know
Four letter words
Open the door
I understand
I wanna be sedated
Before tomorrow comes
I'm not afraid anymore
I'll be your friend
Back and forth
Crashing down, crashing down
Profile, Profile
When you go
It's just life's anatomy
And your panic stricken
So come on
I wanna be
'Cause we're tripping Billies
Yeah yeah
Art for arts sake
You're so far away
the hottest thing in town
And I love you
Falling to pieces
I'm looking for love
Come on yeah
Faster faster
I heard him cry
Lucinda, Lucinda
I wonder where you've been?
You're not the only one
When your heart
Please don't go
Everyday hurts
These bitter days shall remain
My comfortable existence is reduced
Hey my children
Oh oh oh oh
Give it away
Soldier on
I'm waiting for
The hardest part
I fell in love
I'm holding on
Erase/Replace
I just don't care
Got an illusion,
Yeah, oh yeah
And I tried.
Leave the light
Can't explain
Spin you around
Do you believe
We go speeding
Get high the real music hey yeah
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Seperate Yourself
Stressing out
Ten miles high tonight.
We can live forever
Wildest dreams
Who claimed my liberty
You better run
Don't believe in
I'm only dancing
Blood on blood
But you know
And you're to blame
Whatcha gonna do?
There's no way out
Gotta get away
I feel alright
And I'm waiting
Take what's mine
Hey hey hey hey
I'm still breathing
I'm gonna kiss, your ruby red lips
Now you'll shut the bellboy out tonight
I got Jackson Cannery
- Goin' round and round and round
That's all lies
I don't want you
Show me, Mother
This is my aeroplane
Here we go
And I've been here before
Nobody really knows, nobody knows
Today's the day
We're the kids Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh
She feels no joy
But I don't understand
Through the night
In super overdrive
Eight days a week
And Kathy knows
Shut up, shut up
When you're down
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Two hearts beat as one
Stark Raving Love
It's never too late
You make me feel alright
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Teach me heartache
Regrets, I've had enough
There's no doubt
Help me understand
Send me an ambulance
Take a look at you
This is the night
In a state of mind
It's hard to believe
Pour your misery
Your broken dreams
Goodbye, goodbye
Stop runnin' away
I'm wasting my time
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It's everything
I need to know
And your eyes
You're not hopeless or helpless
You gotta move on
You gotta move
An oceanside?
Smiling stranger every day
Tell me why
i'll come with me
Peace and Love
Are you there?
Heartbreaker, can't take anymore
Don't let me go
In the night
Don't come easy
It's beautiful
When you're young
Tonight's the night,
His mind's exploded, ego's overloaded
You are my friends
I don't wanna go faster
Earth mother for you
All my life
If I close my eyes
I'm in love
Feelin' all alone
Steamy windows
I'm so distracted
One shot nothing
I think about tomorrow
Love me two times girl
And Sally said, Sally said
Word for word forward
I want to be
Keep the faith
Great expectations
Open up your eyes
And all the same
Like hell bent inn
Dreams come true
We'll be lovers again
Black and white
In the dark
Are you ready?
Take a look around,
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The beach is free
Feelin' Alright
Stop, stop, stop, stop
I've been thinking about last night
But it's too late
Don't stop dancing
Sitting all alone
All my friends
You're driving me crazy
I know for sure
I'm waiting
I thought about it
Get back, get back
You won't be scarred like that
Haaah-haaah-haaah
It's all gone
I got a groovy thing goin', baby
Fast company
You're so brilliant
Whatever you want
The sun is shining
I'm sick and tired
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, lighten up
Let me go
I think of you
Friends of P.
Please don´t say it´s over
She doesn't know her name
That's how strong my love for you
Innocent child
This is the only one
My hands are tied
Waiting around for you
We're the issue
Hey, everything's gonna be alright
It's been so long
It's not enough
My perfect day
Without suspecting
All night, all night
I can't let go
I gotta get away
Everything happens
La lala la lalala
The ones forgotten
Hey, yeah, yeah
No more good pain
And the sun
Do you know?
You're the one
I'm falling to pieces
And the world
Feels like fire
Nite and Gray
Everything can change your mind
She is perpetual Kathy
Will convert, for you
Do you remember
I'm thinking of you
Burn, baby burn
Now you're gone
Sweet Jane
Are you listening?
No, no, no, no
Everybody's coming round today
I'm looking for
Don't give up
It's been too long
Don't you cry
Why can't you see
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
These visions are
Sometimes I wonder
All the time
How can I do?
If you don't know
There's nothing to do
Huckleberry Grove
Tiny explosions
Like a mega force
I'll do anything
Make me understand
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Somebody's gotta shine
A friend of mine
You make me smile
Goin' home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway
And there's nothing left
That's all she wrote
Prove yourself
everybody rules
It's better this way
I'll never shatter
Born as ghosts
Dancing with myself
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
I'm alright
Sweet Virginia countryside
I won't scare myself
And I'm moving on
Look at all
Heh neh awah neh
It could happen to you
It's getting harder
I'll never know
I don't wanna fall
You were gonna tremble
I'll stand by you
When the sun
Lord, the beauty's on duty
Shock! Shock!
We'll still dance tonight
Gonna truck all night long
Above the tracks
Not my imagination
I'm perfectly lonely
On and on and on
I know what to do
And now you're gone
'Cause you know
And it's twenty-five to midnight
Come on baby
I see Donna everywhere
Come with me
Open your eyes
It's gonna rain
NaNa Naaa NaNa
There's always something going on
There goes my heart
Whenever you're ready
And everything
Turn back time
Nobody's gonna set you free
So she's leaving
This won't last forever
Change your mind
You've Got To Keep Up
I see you again
In my imagination
I can't live without love
It's the singer sings his song
Take me away
Wake up, Wake up
Fabulously lazy
You're going nowhere, you're going
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse
Shock you again!
It makes me wonder
On the ground
Feel me, feel me
Hey ho, let's go!
You wrecked my life
You have got feelings too
Won't you please
Day after day
A day called zero
Did you give yourself away
I believe
I want to know
I'm a troublemaker
Say goodbye now
You're wasting my time
I'm not scared
They reprocessed their brains
A natural defensive mechanism
I'm never coming back
Hey now, hey now
Without a doubt
Fear of sleep
Don't let go
Oh yeah
L.A. Woman Sunday afternoon.
Far away, far away
See the marionettes making puppet plans
Is anybody there?
With you tonight
Oh, baby all right
Make out alright
Na na na na na na
Nice boys they don't last
So many wasted promises rhapsodised
Give it up
We're gonna hit the ground
Breathe in immortality
Little miss dangerous
Take my hand
Aah, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit
Your mother was right!
Again and again and again
I believe in
Looking for something
Time and time again
I would do anything
You and me together, fighting for
Ever fallen in love
'Cause in sleepy London town
It's never enough
Little Paradise
Bring bring bring
And it's getting late
We were such terrible liars
You can shove it
Hey, nuclear reactor
drop down dead tonight
Runaway, runaway
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
After all these great questions
Hold on, hold on
To love somebody
You're not free
I can't sleep at night
I believe in me
I'll be waiting
I'm only miles away
Love labours on
So happy together
Fighting the stall
You mystify me
In the night, tonight's the night
Show you good-bye
The Tomahawk Kid
I can't stand it
Just push play
You are the only one
Devil doll, devil doll
Under the invisible
Don't trust a woman
If you abandon me
I wanna know
This is metallic blood
The beauty of gray
I'm gonna live forever
It's not too late
I believe, I believe
I've got tonight
And everybody knows
Long may you run.
We've got each other
doesn't really matter
Time is standing still
I am un chien andalusia
Gimme medication to cure this hole
I don't want to
When you're gone
Don't bring me lightening
Waiting for something
I'm goin' away
Let your heart
You didn't break it
Late at night
Slower than nowhere
Heavens looking better every day
The faith healer
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, late at night
Wild-eyed southern boys
I don't know anything
You're still breathing
Like Steve McQueen
Can you remember?
This is country
Uh...Uh...Uh...Uh...Uh...Uh
You're gonna be alright
Long tall cool one
High acetate, fly elevate
La la la la la
I've been waiting
Why don't you know
You made somebody's heart break
Oh, oh, oh
Open up your mind
The sweet feeling's gone
And I know
Hustle and cuss
Don't turn away
Oh yeah, oh yeah
In a English Country Garden
All aboard rooster waits you
Here they come
Don't these city lights
Keep in mind, keep in mind
Out of control:Nowhere to go.
White Noise white noise sound
Don't worry More!
I want you
Forgive me, forgive me
Doesn't really matter
I'm just sentimental
Being Number One
In your eyes
'ello kiddies
I don't mind
You're getting closer
Gonna live while I'm alive
Forever endeavor
High sensitivity
Sooner or later
You're not the same
Skin and bones
In the cold, cold night
In the morning
There's nothing left to lose
Lucky bleeders, lucky bleeders
There's no more
Words are missing
Holiday, holiday
All that glitters is gold
Live freestyle, come on
What are we fightin' for?
Can't you see?
No religion at all
If you want
Sweet as radio
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
The cult of personality
I'm gonna wait forever?
it d-d-d-doesn't stop
What's going on
Stay with me
Thinking of Brazilia
When everybody loves you
Just like you
Never sleep, never die
Waiting to derail
Better get onboard
Created by god
Your not underground
I think about you
You've Got To Do It
So come on, come on
I've been thinking
In the summertime
Business as usual
Na na na na na na na
You're falling apart
Drown me slowly
Singing, li-de-li-de-li, oh, oh
And there's nowhere to go
I need you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
The first time
Our gas hed marches on
Set it aflame, send it alone.
It's killing me
I didn't know
Tomorrow Belongs To Me
Shake a hand, shake a hand
I know
Shine over Babylon
High Voltage
Same old story again
Thus immersed in
I'm falling down
So don't close your eyes
That's right
On heaven's pearls
I'm heavily broken
And it's all right
Waitin' too long
In my shadow I'm sued
With downcast eyes
I spin so ceaselessly
With more news from nowhere
You're nobody girl
Shut your mouth
Round the hairpin
My heart's on fire
Whatcha gonna do
Gimme more gimme more
There's a silent, deadly message
I'm going down
Are you holding yourself?
Don't turn around
Whatever happened to you
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
Mean, mean, mean, mean girl
Does anyone care?
At least I'm moving on
Something comes along
It'll be alright
Let it go, let it go
There are many here among us
It's all right, all right
Home, home, this house
Don't be afraid
Pour your misery down
Please forgive us
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, mother of pearl
You bring me down
There's nothing left
Down in Silvertown
Nothing's gonna change
Please, please
Nobody - nobody
Fuel my raging heart
I'm highly suspicious of you
Bring me rocks, bring me lightening
somewhere up above
Lots of pretty girls
What is it?
I don't really care
Time stood still
There's no return
My, my, my, aye-aye, woo!
Waiting for you
Say goodbye
Don't walk away
Na na na na na na na na
And your no letter goal
Don't drop your arms
I know it's true
Higher and higher
I am hates who I've been.
I'll be there for you
Looking at each other
And that's right
The only cosmonaut
A petal, another petal
Just say goodbye
Come on come on
I've been there before
The time has come
Take this bottle
Madness at mid-mid-mid-midnight
Everything's alright
Slowly breaking through
She fuckin' hates me
Run away I've mastered feeling nothing.
M-m-m-my Sharona
Headline hustler
No doubt about it
He's my hometown hero
'Cause you're rock candy, baby
Freedom Overspill
Give me little drink
It's that sinking feeling
I'm the blackmail man
My wheels won't turn
You're no fun
Without you
It's overflowing.
Uh huh huh huh, the glory
I can't believe
Take me down
Hey, hey, hey
She's an AIRHEAD.
Fight the force
Butterfly, butterfly
Everything will be alright
You've got everyone,everyone
Living on borrowed time
Don't let it go
Because I'm housin
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I don't understand
Nothing's as heavy as an empty heart
I WALKED INTO THE WALL
The zip gun boogie's comin' on strong.
Everyone says “Hi”
Over and over and over
I don't belong here
Cold hard bitch
Come on and on and on
Then love comes tumbling down
Let's dance
And then sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
I'm coming home
The greatest view from here
In the Indian summer
And you know
Thinking of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, lighten up
You're feeling your way
I don't know what it's like
Human wheels spin round
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, boom
Raise your hands
Watching over me
All this time
Hard drivin' man
Dead or alive
The London bombs
Your mind goes, your mind
A change would do anything
Come on, hey
As he approaches the door
Never stop us running
You're over-ground
Get your four letter word
I can't understand
Keep it precious
Gotta live, gotta live
Night after night
Don't close your eyes
Barbarous longing
Moment in paradise
I'm all alone
Ending with letting go
La lala lala la lalala
Down, down, down
Than poor ol' broken hearted me
Tonight, tonight
friends forever
Another breaking point of view
Don´t hurt yourself
Come on and on
Won't hold nothing anymore
What's it gonna be?
Down the Rio Grande
I've been waiting for you
Everybody's Girl, Everybody's Girl
We'll breathe again, again
Don't pay no attention to me
Ridin' ridin' ridin'
The hardest button to button, ah oh
'Cause your mamma won't like me
Hey boys and girls
There's no doubt about it
E.V.E.R.Y.B.O.D.Y.
Tomorrow people
At least I'm moving forward
For stormy weather
And all the time
Over and over
Fa-falling, fa-falling harder
So lonely, so lonely
It don't matter anyway
She will enjoy the feast
La la la la la la la
Everything is wrong
Another mind gone
Out of control
Keeping everything inside
And she'll receive us
And I don't know why
It's independence day
Interested in you
La la la la la la la la la la la la
You can sacrifice me
There ain't nothin like my Ken and Barbie doll
Sweet Thistle Pie
I can't explain
Just my imagination
You're wasting time, yeah
Whoa mule, whoa mule
You okay, Annie?
And I don't care
Take away temptation now
There's nothing wrong
I can't help myself
It's all right
Tonight is fine
Leave me alone
The truth always hurts
Black Shuck Black Shuck
Just one more time
Paperback writer
Crazy, crazy, crazy
I'm waiting for you
Nobody rides for free
NoooBooody Nobody rides for free
When love calls your name
'Til you clear your names
She's got soul
Do-be-da, do-be-da
It don't slither no more
I can't stand losing
'Cause I'm housin
I don't wanna know
Come on over, whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Plastic silver nine volt heart

Ran, ja, ja, ran
American Roulette
Ninety-nine pounds of soul
Gas gas quick lads,
The boy's bad news
This is radio nowhere
Dance, dance, dance
There's something wrong here
Don't say goodbye
It's times like these
Change change change
It's a beautiful day
Seeing red again
Only women bleed
Yes, I'm ready, willing and able
Romeo's waiting
When my wheels won't turn
Oh yes we're falling down
It's too late
This is atomic love
Still in Hollywood
"I should've learned it"
She's my cherry pie
All because of you
You don't know why
Before he blows his top
I'm lifting You higher
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Nerve gas, nerve gas, no class
I can't get enough
Somewhere through that door
You and me
Look lovely look lovely
A million watts of love
I'll be there
Molly's chamber gonna change
With or without you
I'm not sleepin' anymore, anymore
Supply and demand
Yesterday girl, yesterday girl
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Send lawyers, guns and money
That don't satisfy me
I'm outta the wasteland
Yeah, yeah
Everything about you
For more news from nowhere
Hope it gives you hell
I should've known better
Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what
Round and round
Living on Tulsa Time.
