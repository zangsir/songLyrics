But don't leave your keys for me, open the door
Nobody's getting hurt here if nobody cares
Nobody's getting lost if nobody's going anywhere

And darling I know that you can't be sure of anything anymore

I wanna love you like it ain't no secret
Like I'm not ashamed to show
Nor would I ever, oh never never
Oh never let you go
I'll never let you go

I'm on a tight rope maybe I'm scared
Maybe I love you but you never play fair
So shed a little light where nobody sees
I built a bible for the saints with my disbelief

And darling I know that you can't be sure of anything anymore

I wanna love you like it ain't no secret

Like I'm not ashamed to show
Nor would I ever, oh never never
Oh never let you go

My love is easy
Tell me bout yours and then
Tell me you need me
Carry me home again
It's been a mystery
Most of the time
Stranded on the big top
Throw me a line

I wanna love you like it ain't no secret
Like I'm not ashamed to show
Nor would I ever, oh never never
Oh never let you go
I'll never let you go



It's my turn, searching for another break
Set me free, I only see the setting sun
Let me feel, like my luck has just begun
Wherever I go, it's all the same
We're so much alike, well, with a different name
Days going by, I'm gonna catch 'em again
I'm gonna lose this half-life, I'm on my way

Come on, we never know before we try
Come on, theres nothing we can't leave behind
Come on, we're past the time for questions, why?
Come on, yeah come on, what are we waiting for
Come on

Looking back, what happened to the time we spent
It's gone, no small cost for a life of rent
Let it go, Regret are just for feeling low
Here and now, the only thing that's left to know

Come on, we never know before we try
Come on, theres nothing we can't leave behind
Come on, we're past the time for questions, why
Come on, yeah come on, what are we waiting for

We owe it to ourselves now
And no one else can live our dreams
We owe it to ourselves, come on, come on
What are we waiting for
Come on, we never know before we try
Come on, there's nothing we can't leave behind
Come on, we're past the time for questions, why
Come on, yeah come on, what are we waiting for
Uhhhh, come on,
Come on, we never know before we try
So, come on, come on what are we waiting for
Get it on, It's my turn, set me free
Why don't you set me free, let me feel
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bring it on, bring it on, It's my turn
Set me free
Talk to me throw the ball back
Let me feel, come on



You love me
You love me like you love no one
You leave me
You leave me
You leave me for the second time
You come back
You come back
You come back like you did before
Youre wasted
Youre wasted
Youre wasted like you were in

California, fairyland
California, you can't look bad
Were over
Were over

Were over with this you and me
Youre happy
Im happy
Were happy in our make belive
Youre with another one
Youre with another one

Youre with that neighbours deep tanned blonde
You scumbag
You scumbag

Youre scum and you can go to
California, fairyland
California, you can't look bad
California, fairyland
California, you can't look bad
No, no you can't be like that
No way, I can't be like that
Oh no, well soon be like that
California, fairyland
California, you can't look bad
California, fairyland
California, you can't look bad



That it weighs you down
So all you have is time
Don't turn away
We have both seen darker days
And there's always a light that shines

Do you feel like all your hopes are a long way gone
Does it seem like every road only takes you down
Do they shut you out
Don't be afraid of what they say
Throw back your head and cry

When you need somebody, find me there
When you're feeling empty I'll be there - find me

When you're feeling weary with no peace of mind
And the tone of your voice is hollow
You're home to stranger that won't belong
And there's no-one else to follow

Do you feel like nowhere, oh no, there's no better way
Does it seem like nobody hears a word you say
And they shut you out
And where does it say that a man aint a right
To throw back his head and cry

You don't need to tell me 'cos I know
I know how you feel you're miles away
You don't need to show me nobody listens to a word you say
We can shut them out
Where does it say that a man aint a right
To throw back his head and cry

When you need somebody find me there
I'll be right beside you
When you're feeling empty I'll be there
Can you hear me? I'll be singing



I'm gonna stop and think twice about the way that I'm living 
did I say a kind word, am I proud of my actions 
you know a job well done gives me satisfaction

Can I earn your trust, your love and affection 
just one step at a time in the right direction 
I'm gonna aim for the sky, keep my feet on the ground 
raise my voice to the heavens, make a joyful sound 


Na na na na na na na na 
Make a joyful sound

Can I sing for my supper and play for my rent?
I know it sounds funny but it's how my time's spent
greet everyday with full purpose, with passion and pride 
I'm gonna follow my heart, have nothing to hide

A moment of insight; I know why I'm here 
you know, the time just stopped, I see it all real clear 
I've got to set an example, make some mischief and fun 
do unto others and play a fat bass run

I gotta work hard every day and give it my best 
grab hold of fear and negativity and lay 'em to rest 
I know my time here's important, can I do the right thing?
practice patience and forgiveness, feel the joy that they bring

Can I lay down tonight without feeling regret?
I know the love that I give becomes the love that I get 
well do you hear what I'm saying, makin' sense to you? 
if you feel it in your heart then you'll wanna sing too



I don't want to sound preachy, make it feel all wrong 
just want to write some kind of lyrics, sing a feel-good song
it's kind of hard to explain, it's just a feeling I get 
from makin' music, makin' love, gettin' both feet wet 

Every piece to the puzzle snaps tight in the groove 
I close my eyes, breathe deeply and let my feet move
you know I feel a little better now for speaking my mind 
good vibes and circulation, see who they find



Out of the broken down peoples
And we built the new languages
Out of courtesy and velocity
Somebody got to have propulsion
Push the envelope

Extra, extra - read all about it
Common sense makes a comeback
Extra, extra - late in the distant city
There are seventeen burned out cars in the valley
And "boom" goes the refinery
Where do nomads go when the Dow Jones falls too low?
Crazy world
Lee says forty-nine

We tried to get across the river
Ringo, Bobo, el numero - holy cow
At Leek town hall tonight
Get me a taxi, goddamn
Take me to a reggae city

I'm always reporting for you
In the dangerous bureau
This is McNally, badge forty-nine, calling in
I'm with Mike Flynn
Taxi, goddamn
Ringo



In the grainy light of four o'clock
He sits on his hands a lot
He's kind of nervous 

I don't think he's got much money
But he's got the time of day 

'Cause God drinks down at the Sandringham these days
Since the Shakespeare changed its name
He drinks down at the Sandringham these days
He's what we call alright around here 

Talks a bit, he likes to sit
Watches people come in and smiles
Somehow we're part of him
We nod and chat a while 

He drinks slowly like it's holy

And all at once I realized my heart's at the mercy of your will.
Tina, I kissed your tender lips and fell under your spell,
I'm so devoted to you 'cause I love you and I always will.
'Cause you hypnotized me and made me your slave,
A slave to your kisses - a slave to your kind, loving ways.
Tina, you thrilled me with your touch and I can't get free;
Free from the chains of love that I pray will soon bind you to me.
'Cause you hypnotized me and made me your slave,
A slave to your kisses - a slave to your kind, loving ways.
Tina, you thrilled me with your touch and I can't get free;
Free from the chains of love that I pray will soon bind you to me.



The drummer and the wine
Heartbeat in the sand
Rings inside your hand

I am the body power
The rhythm of your joy
The spiral in the air
The wine inside a prayer

Ride on the rising tide
Walk on the water
Spray with each burning day
High, going higher

I am the shout of thunder
A cannon in the wind
Tearing up the skies
Blinding out the lies

I am the beat of anger
The temple of your hate
Horseman in the night
Hell-hound in the night

Ride on the rising tide
Walk on the water
Spray with each burning day
High, going higher

I am the dance of ages
The drummer and the wine
Heartbeat in the sand
Rings inside your hand

I am the body power
The rhythm of your joy
The spiral in the air
The wine inside a prayer

Ride on the rising tide
Walk on the water
Spray with each burning day
High, going higher



With your hair hanging down on your shoulders,
And I love the way you dance your slow sweet tango,
The way you wanna do everything but talk,
And how you stare at me with those undress me eyes,
Your breath on my body makes me warm inside.

Let's make out - Let's do somthing amazing,
Let's do somthing that's all the way,
'Cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch your body,
Now I never wanna let your body go.

Let's make a night, to remember,
From January, to December,
Let's make love, to excite us,
A memory, to ignite us,
Let's make honey baby, soft and tender,
Let's make sugar darlin', sweet surrender,
Let's make a night, to remember,
All life long.

I love the way you move tonight,
Beads of sweat dripping down your skin,
Me lyin' here - and you lyin' there,
Our shadows on the wall and our hands everywhere.

Let's make out - Let's do somthing amazing,
Let's do somthing that's all the way,
'Cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch your body,
Now I never wanna let your body go.

From January, to December,
Let's make love, to excite us,
A memory, to ignite us,
Let's make honey baby, soft and tender,

Let's make a night, to remember,
All life long.

Oh and I think about you all the time,
Can't you see you drive me out of my mind,
Well I'm never holding back again,
Yeah I never want this night to end,
'Cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch your body,
Now I never wanna let your body go.

Let's make a night, to remember,

Let's make a night, to remember - oh,
Let's make love - Slow and tender,
Let's make a night, to remember.



you listen once and soon forget what I said,
'cause it's all in your head.

I love you like a new adiction,
you kiss me once and then go missing,
so long, you've been gone all along,

With your happiness and satisfaction,
distorted by the big attraction,
I cut you down and set you free,
I pull the darkness over me.

I can't help it, I can't help myself
and you know it,
'cause there's nobody else,
yer, there's nobody else.

Waking up was not so easy, you sobered up quite completely, feel down,
there was no one around

But, your sentimental chain reactions,
tied to all the old distractions,
I held you temporarily,
to rest your bones here next to me.

I can't help it, I can't help myself
and you know it,
'cause there's nobody else,
yer, there's nobody else.

It's just happiness and satisfaction,
safely in the ground reaction, ?
it'll make you who you wanna be,
I pull the darkness over me.

I can't help it, I can't help myself
and you know it,
'cause there's nobody else,
yer, there's nobody else.
Nobody else



Some other place
We might not of bin here
Standin' face to face

I just wanna tell ya
Made up my mind
You know I can't help the way I feel inside

Oh this heart's on fire
Right from the start it's bin burnin' for you
Oh this heart's on fire
One thing honey - this heart's true

The streets are empty
The lights are down
Ain't nothin' movin'
This side of town

So come on over
I ain't hard to please
Oh baby - what you get ain't always what you need

Oh this heart's on fire
It's getting hotter now can't you see
Oh this heart's on fire
From now on babe it's gonna be you and me

Risin' to my feet I can feel the heat
It's tryin' to pull me under
Runnin' through the night I can make it right
Its comin' on like thunder

Some got it good some got it bad
But you're the best I ever had
I never worry you're so fine
From now on babe I'm gonna be by your side



when the wind blew clouds in shapes as the sun beat down
remember then? now and later days
when the kids came out to play
all of life was now
and the future seemed so far away
and we'd shine shine shine
runnin' through the dandelions in the summertime of my life
remember then? bit o honey days
back when 8-tracks were the craze with that far-out sound
and the future seemed so far away
and we'd shine shine shine
runnin' through the dandelions in the summer sun havin' fun
and we'd shine shine shine
we were happy by design in the summertime of my life
I never had a second thought about lookin' back
if I was headed down that road there'd be no turnin' back
remember then? good and plenty days
when the wind blew clouds in shapes as the sun beat down
and the future seemed so far away
shine shine shine runnin' through the dandelions
in the summer sun havin' fun
and we'd shine shine shine we were happy by design
in the summertime of my life



They pushed you too far
And all of your thoughts
Came apart within so

They pushed you too hard
They pushed you too far
Fate comes, and fate heals all the worst of our debts
There's a broken man inside
There's a broken man inside
He'll break, he'll break, he'll break, he'll break, he'll break, he'll break

The styles are gonna change
Time will go away
The styles are gonna change, but I won't
If I could find a way
I'd suffer all your pain
Time will go away, but I won't



Douglas
At your window all day long
Such a lonely song

Oh Oh Oh
You sing and I'll echo
Oh Oh Oh
You sink and I'll follow
Well here we go

We took you down the west free world
Oh so far away
From the hills of home
At your window all day long
Such a lonely song

Oh Oh Oh
You sing and I'll echo
Oh Ooh Oh
You sink and I'll follow
Well here we go

But it's too late
It's too late
I'll sing along
But I know it won't change our fate

Wooah oooh
You sing and I'll echo
Oh Oh Oh
You sink and I'll follow
Oh Oh Oooh



My time machine crashed over yonder	
The syphillis is a bitch, but contracting HIV is much worse
Why are you pushing info into me
I have no need for it, I'm from the stars	

I thought you'd like to know the scoop
I'm taking babies back with me, yeah
I'm taking them back home
So they can see there's a much better place
I've got a sister with an open mind
And my friends are all junkies
But they're still my friends
As long as they don't use monkeys
We enjoyed the heat of stolen days in the summer of '93

Well the future boy said
"I've got friends but you know some times 
it all depends on how tall they are against yourself"

I am the future boy Hello, the future boy
I am the future boy Hello, the future boy
I am the future boy Hello, the future boy
I am the future boy Hello, the future boy

I am the future boy Hello, the future boy
I am the future boy Hello, the future boy
I am the future boy Hello, the future boy
I am the future boy Hello, the future boy

My friends have all gone and left me
so I decided to come here and see myself as a baby
But it looks like I'm stuck here this time
Oh shit, gonna miss my friends
And no, you're still you're the future
Yes I'm still the future boy
We'll build you a time machine to get back home

Still the future boy 
Still the future boy
Still the future boy
Oh, I'm still the future boy

Still the future boy
Still the future boy
Still the future boy
Well, I'm still the future boy



I thought I was gonna die
But I'm sick and tired of grieving
I've got to find a reason why

If love is not the answer
Then tell me what it's gonna be
If love is not the answer
Why the hell did you give it to me

Because it ain't enough
Just to call it love
It ain't enough
Just to call it love

When you said that you were leaving goodbye
I thought I was gonna die
But I'm sick and tired of grieving
I've got to find a reason why

If love is not the answer
Then tell me what it's gonna be
If love is not the answer
Why the hell did you give it to me

Because it ain't enough
Just to call it love
It ain't enough
Just to call it love

If love is not the answer
Then tell me what it's gonna be
If love is not the answer
Why the hell did you give it to me

Because it ain't enough
Just to call it love
It ain't enough
Just to call it love



Always catches my eye
Like the smile you gave me
It's such a sensual line


Baby I can feel you
The stone is gonna thaw
Baby I can heal you
Baby, you should take the flaw
You were the one who told me you were made of stone
Why must you come back to me to rock your weary bones?
I tried to tell you

There's a crack in the pavement
Comes as no surprise
You melt like wax from a candle
When I look in your eyes



There's a crack in the pavement


You were the one who told me you were made of stone
Why must you come back to me to rock your weary bones?
I tried to tell you

There's a crack in the pavement



And show you what I'm thinking
I'll take you anywhere
That you wanna go
I'm sitting here bored and lonely and
You know that anytime you're free
To show me how you feel
I'll take it anywhere that you want to go
Anywhere that you wanna go

And I'd make it right if you wanted it
I want it back more than you know
I'd cross the line if you wanted it
I want you back

And I'm waiting for you
To get that feeling once again
Reunited in the end
And I've been waiting for you
To capture my imagination
Cuz I've been fooled by the illusions in my head
In my head

Now I realize I never had it so good
You took me anywhere I wanted to go
Now I'm sitting here dreaming of the days we led
Anytime I wanted I could show you how I feel
I can't go anywhere that I want to go
Anywhere that I want to go

And I'd make it right if you wanted it
I want it back more than you know
I'd cross the line if you wanted it
I want you back

And I'm waiting for you
To get that feeling once again
Reunited in the end
And I've been waiting for you
To capture my imagination
Cuz I've been fooled by the illusions in my head
In my head

I'll take it anywhere
I'll take it anywhere
I'll take it anywhere
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go

And I'd make it right if you wanted it
I want it back more than you know
I'd cross the line if you wanted it
I want you back
I'm waiting for you
To get that feeling once again
Reunited in the end
I've been waiting for you
To capture my imagination
Cuz I've been fooled by the illusions in my head
And I've been fooled by the illusions in my head
And I've been fooled by the illusions in my head



That thunderstorm's still crashing in your cranium
Find that all these funny faces look the same
I know who's to blame, but I swore I wouldn't say

It's time that I got moving on
As you're still burning the dress you wore to senior prom
Try to forget how you've been touched
I loved you so I told you, but it didn't matter much

And I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about
These days I don't have much to say to you
And I've been drunker than a skunk
Ever since the day I left you
With your darkest secret safely packed away 
Up in my steamer trunk

Why I turned out the way I did
Someone somewhere dropped me on my cranium
I'm sorry, could you repeat what you just said?
My short term memory is gone, but my long term's far from dead

I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about these days
I don't have much to say to you
And I've been drunker than a skunk
Ever since the day I left you
With your darkest secret safely packed away 
Up in my steamer trunk

In my steamer trunk

And I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about
These days I don't have much to say to you
And I've been swearing like a sailor
Since the day that I left her
With her darkest secret safely packed away 
Up in my steamer trunk



For all these years
And all your troubles
They all turn into fears

I wanna thank you
I wanna shake you
I wanna break through

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

And all these people
They're all coming to you
I always thought that
I knew it was true

Oh, here she comes now
All dressed in red
Those were the days that I hoped
We might be dead

I wanna thank you
I wanna shake you
I wanna break through

I'm on my way
I'm on my way

And when they come to get you
I hope you're all right
We're gonna get free
We're gonna get out tonight

And when it's over
Well, I hope it's okay
We're gonna make up
We're gonna make it today, hey

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

I'm on my way
What did they say?
I'm on my way



Tulane and Johnny opened a novelty shop
Back under the counter, was the cream of the crop
Everything was clickin' and the business was good
'Til one day, lo and behold, an officer stood
Johnny jumped the counter but he stumbled and fell
But Tulane made it over Johnny as he yelled

Go ahead on, Tulane, he can't catch up with you
Go Tulane, he ain't man enough for you
Go Tulane, use all the speed you got
Go Tulane, you know you need a lot
Go Tulane, he's laggin' behind
Go 'head on, Tulane go head on

Go by your father's house and tell him business is slow
And see if he will loan us something, soon as he hits the dough
Put the cat out in the hall and rumple up the room
Go by Doctor Keller's, tell him you swallowed some perfume
Tell him we need him quick, 'cuz he may have to testify
That you been sick all day and that's a perfect alibi

Go ahead on, Tulane, he can't catch up with you
Go Tulane, he ain't man enough for you
Go Tulane, use all the speed you got
Go Tulane, you know you need a lot
Go Tulane, he's laggin' behind
Go 'head on, Tulane go head on 

Go, let Danny drive in case you run into the Man
Back by the shop and git the stuff and hide it in the van
Go back by your father's, get the money for the bail
And bring it down and bail me out this rotten, funky jail
We gotta get a lawyer in the click of politics
Somebody who can win the thing or get the thing fix

Go ahead on, Tulane, he can't catch up with you
Go Tulane, he ain't man enough for you
Go Tulane, use all the speed you got
Go Tulane, you know you need a lot
Go Tulane, he's laggin' behind
Go 'head on, Tulane go head on 

Go Tulane







That you ask before too long
I won't have the answer
But I promise to be stronger

You lied to me, you lied to me
Like I was some fool, yes you did
You lied to me, you cried for me
I told you to keep your cool

I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
And to be strong, to be stronger

There was a time
I felt no shame
In asking please, please me
But your rejection
Has brought me to my knees

You lied to me, you lied to me
Like I was some fool, yes you did
You lied to me, but that's history
I told you to keep your cool

I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
And to be strong, to be stronger

All the people
Are ready to hold your hand
All the people
Are ready to understand

The things you do

I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
And to be strong, to be stronger



Time is growing old and I am getting colder
Hunger's just a pain that won't be fed
I'll be working for the ghost until I'm dead and done
Over and done, over

Disaster in a halo
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters 
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters

Somewhere there's a girl with thoughts of him
She makes wishes in a well then fears them caving in on her, around, on her

Disaster in a halo
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters 
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters

Cause in the well, plans will come and plan will go undone
I know, I know
And you can't tell, I will come and I will go I know, I know
But why would I?
But why would I?

Disaster in a halo
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters 
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters



Babe, I've got to have you but you're never ever, ever there
Hey, the game is over, give it up right now
You're teasin' me, baby, how do you expect me to be without you
 
You let your hair down low
You didn't want to know about lovin' me, babe
Let's live for today, tomorrow may never come
Let's live for today, tomorrow may never come
But you just can't tell anymore

Baby, you're a teaser but you just don't dare
Baby, keep your secrets, this whole thing just ain't fair
Tonight is almost over, tomorrow you'll be gone away
So please baby, won't you stay

You let your hair down low
You didn't want to know about lovin' me, babe
Let's live for today, tomorrow may never come
Let's live for today, tomorrow may never come
But you just can't tell anymore

You let your hair down low
You didn't want to know about lovin' me, babe
Let's live for today, tomorrow may never come
Let's live for today, tomorrow may never come
But you just can't tell anymore



Let's keep it right, just like it used to be
It's such a long and wasted ride
When you're on your own, when you're all alone
I throw a word in for the real men
Hey driver man, hey cardboard man
On a cardboard scene you know it's never make-believe
Now, do you believe in me?
And freedom's only what they strip away from you
You fight back
But what you gain is nothing like it

Let's walk on by
It's a mellow song and I mean it well
So don't you trample me down!
Cause it took a lot of nerve
For me to try and come across
Let's do it, let's do it right
I tried, I tried so hard I could only fail
Let's do it, let's do it right

Right now, right now
And don't you ever walk away from me
I'm gonna need you round for the rebound
I search myself for sheets of paper
Some little stain, some little stain
And this is all conclusive evidence
Everybody rise, I rest my case

Let's walk on by
It's a mellow song and I mean it well
So don't you trample me down!
Cause it took a lot of nerve
For me to try and come across
Let's do it, let's do it right
I tried, I tried so hard I could only fail
Let's do it, let's do it right

Right now, right now
I find it hard being strong these days
I find it very hard, hard
And even harder in the night-time
When all these clouds come down
I find I'm very, very, hard to define
I could not be electric animal's, front-man
All distorted, all noise
And this is never, ever, my familiar voice

Let's walk on by
It's a mellow song and I mean it well
So don't you trample me down!
Cause it took a lot of nerve
For me to try and come across
Let's do it, let's do it right
I tried, I tried so hard I could only fail
Let's do it, let's do it right



It's been a while oh honey, my old friend
You've been there for me, faithful as you can be
You're the one I count on in the end

I wish it weren't so but that's how it seems to go
One night you're making memories then that's all you are

Well, hello again, tell me where you've been
It's been a while oh honey, my old friend
You've been there for me, faithful as you can be
You're the one I count on in the end
Well, hello again

I wish it weren't so but that's how it seems to go
One night your making memories then that's all you are

Well, hello again, here's to what might have been
We've got no secrets, no reasons to pretend
Talk about old times, laugh until we cry
We haven't done this since I don't know when

Well, hello again, tell me where you've been
Well, hello again, here's to you old friend

Well, hello again, la, la, la, la, la, la
Well, hello again, la, la, la, la, la, la
Well, hello again, la, la, la, la, la, la
Well, hello again, la, la, la, la, la, la



but i did my time
and i came back
and i took what was mine
one look into your eyes
and i know what you mean
i know what it spells
it spells never come
back again


what a beautiful story
it's the best ever told
and it all went void
and it all went void
i gotta let it go
take a deep breath
and go home
when the lights go out
i will be alright

take a look at the sky
tell me what do you see
nothing but memories
some are fading
some are beaming
i don't know what they mean
i don't know why i'm here
but i'm sure those stars will
never disappear



Oh I'm not asking for paradise, I just got to find me a home

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh I gotta find some shelter from the cold
Land-ho, will I be searching forever
Oh-oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul

Well you may think I'm a fool, and think I'm running away
But I've had enough of the city lights, oh I've got no reason to stay

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh I need some wind to help me to my goal
Land-ho, will I be searching forever
Oh-oh, I gotta find an anchor for my soul

When you're alone there's not a sail in sight
Oh it's cold and dark and there's no one there to see you through the night
There once was a lady made me feel alright
But she couldn't stay so one lonely day, she just sailed away
And took away my life

Maybe I'll always be sad, and maybe there'll always be strife
Drifting alone with a saddened tone, afloat on the ocean of life

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh sometimes I feel my ship is getting old
Land-ho, will I be dreaming forever
Oh-oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul

Will I be sailing forever…



From this soil my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah oh yeah

He made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand oh yeah

White man, white man
Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies
White man, white man
You took away the sight to blind my simple eyes
White man, white man
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made

Oh the red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah

Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by ev'ry god's name
Say a prayer for your race
Oh yeah

White man, white man
Our country was green and all our rivers wide
White man, white man
You came with a gun and soon our children died
White man, white man
Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed?

White man, white man
White man
White man, white man
For you battled with lies
White man, white man
Still lies
White man, white man
Say you look around every skin and bone again

What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forgot how to learn
Oh yeah

And recognize the circle
You gotta listen now
Get wise before they lift your eyes

You gotta listen now
And hold your children closer
You gotta listen now
Get down or you won't be around

Now listen, now now listen...

Well the sunshine shines all day when the man calls for his pay
But you gotta go through that
Yes, you gotta go through that

When you've paid what you owe, you might have to try to slow
But you gotta go through that
So, you gotta live through that

But when the masters of the tame require to repossess your name
You don't have to go through that
You don't have to live through that

Thunder rolling down out of dried-up skies
Every inch of earth crying out for water
Television man spelling out the price
Everywhere the sheep creeping to the slaughter
Cold weather coming, people feel the fire
Living on Dead End Street with no desire

Is it any wonder you've got no power
When you pay a thief to keep it for you?
Is it a surprise that your wine is sour
When you let a liar choose the brew he pours you?
Talk on the wire about force and choice
It's uncomfortable to raise your voice

Everybody whispering behind their hand
Selling their despair to any stronger man
Don't have to listen now

We taught ourselves to trust our heads
It's getting us nowhere
If fifty-five million hearts can't feel it
We'll never know where

Polish up your silver and hide your gold
Send the lookout man down to every corner
Gather in the place where it's bought and sold
Next to where you once used to be a learner
Cold weather coming, people feel the fire
Living on Dead End Street with no desire

You gotta listen now now listen, now now listen
Now listen, now now listen
You gotta listen now now listen, now now listen
Now listen, now now listen
You gotta listen now now listen, now now listen
Now listen, now now listen
You gotta listen now now listen, now now listen
Now listen, now now listen
You gotta listen now...



He turns and laughter flickers in his eyes
Intent and direct when he speaks
I watch his lips
When he drives I love to watch his hands
White and smooth almost feminine
Almost American
I have to watch him

In his face age descends on youth
Exaggeration on the truth
He caught me looking then but soon his eyes forgot
And everything he seems to do
Reflects just another shade of blue
I saw her searching into you and ached a while

I watch his lips caress the glass
His fingers stroke its stem and pass
To lift a cigarette at last
He dries his eyes
From the shadows by the stair
I watch as he weeps unaware
That I'm in awe of his despair



Sell your body
To the night

Human flesh

Working out in the weight room
You're trying to make it pay
Sweating for a future
But it's such a long night anyway

Out on the dancefloor
Working up a sweat
Your body's their amusement park
Now enter the night and see what you can get, so

Everybody
Sell your body
Everybody
Sell your body
To the night

Hey, boy, you wanna get ahead
You gotta give some head
Might end up dead instead
Hey, boy, but you can make it right
So fix your hair, alright
And welcome to the night

Down on the corner
You show 'em what you got
Your body's their little candy store
They got their eyes on you
So you gotta keep it hot, so

Everybody
Sell your body
Everybody
Sell your body
To the night

Everybody
Sell your body

Everywhere
Everybody
Fix your hair and sell your body
To the night

When the cats crawl out to mate at night
You'll be there
You'll be there

You can't deny it
It's such a riot
Don't knock it 'til you try it
Sell your body to the night

You've got nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go, so

Everybody
Sell your body
Everybody
Sell your body
To the night

Everybody
Sell your body
To the night
To the night

Everywhere
Everybody
Fix your hair and sell your body
To the night



To think it all becomes way too much
All the things I want and need in life
Seem like the things I never
I never ever touch

I don't deserve the best
The best I will settle will
Revolve with all the rest is rest
And I will sleep my days away
While the others will trust
I try my best

And then it comes to me
My thoughts were all
Were all inside my head

I control my destiny
Until I'm lying
I'm lying
I'm lying
Alone in bed

I raise my head to feel and try
I try to squeeze out a scene from thoughts
But then I fall
I fall asleep
And dream about before

Before I was caught
Before I was caught
Before I was caught
Before I was caught
Before I was caught
Before I was caught



The con man
The liquor store man
Got the man at the premiere to "Spider-Man"
Got the old man calling on the young man
Got the soul man
Trying to keep a hold man
I seen the stars lookin in her eyes
So many times i tried
Seen a man who caught the rainbow's end
He claimed
That the pot of gold resided within


For a name in the U.S.A.
For a little bit of fame today
For a name in the world today
You want to fly high
You want to fly high
You want to fly
You want to fly
You want to fly high

Got the this is your land man
This is my land man
Got the blood on the tracks man
Got the guilty man
Got the innocent man
Got the buffalo soldier
The dreadlock Rastaman
Seen the stars looking in her eyes
So many times I've tried
Talked to a man who caught the
raninbow's end he found
That the pot of gold resided within




My head but never entrusted
Hey analyst, try to make some sense of this
I know it's hard, believe me

You swore to never be bitter when
The odds were favoring elsewhere
Perfectionist try to make the best of this
I know it's hard 'cause we barely made it through winter
We barely made it through winter

Pleading
Not guilty
So don't be
Waiting to throw the first stone
Not guilty,
Not guilty

Your words, burned in my memory
Third degree and getting hotter each and every day
The enemy, closer than a friend to me
Please make yourself feel at home

You swore to make amends orderly
Then turned and killed the acquitted
The enemy, dangling me on a string
I know it's hard pleading 



Not guilty
So don't be 
Waiting to throw the first stone
Not guilty,
So don't be
Reaching for more

'Cause I know you will, you have before
And I have turned my cheek enough to know
You better pray the next one kills me
So pray the next one

We barely made it through winter 2x

Pleading
Not guilty
So don't be 
Waiting to throw the first stone
Not guilty,
So don't be
Reaching for more

Pleading
Not guilty
So don't be
Waiting to throw the first stone
Not guilty
Not guilty



While the nightlight glows with the music on 
You could climb so high in the dreamtime sky 
And go anywhere

In that sometime place ever lost somehow 
In the here and gone or the there and now 
Did it all go bust — crumble down in dust 
Or just slip away

Paging Audrey 
Any random star 
Lost and lonely 
Somewhere very far 
Paging Audrey 
Come in from the cold

In that far-off room drenched in desert sun 
Evil words were spoke — dirty deeds were done 
Could we sail back there snatch them from the air 
I dare anyone

Can we stand right here, call them back and say 
Those were never meant to be heard that way 
Let the heavens crack — let the day go black 
I'd give anything

Paging Audrey 
Somewhere very near 
Safe and silent 
There you are my dear 
Paging Audrey 
Anybody home

In a distant room certain things were said 
As the loved one lies on the love-torn bed 
And the night rolls on and by light of dawn 
You're not anywhere

Paging Audrey 
This is who we are 
Do remember 
On any random star 
Paging Audrey 
Coming strong and pure



It's jet stream, daydream, cocksure hard luck show
His lips a fountain
His daylight sparks
He's a shotgun, schoolyard, street-wise, white-hot kid
Little whipcream, phone call, breakdown, Rain King fist
His mind a countdown
His daydream sparks

I need three years to clear these thoughts
Hey, I like to say I knew one true thing
It feels like years and all I've done is fought
And not turned up anything

Little black, take roll and roll, over my bed
I'm waiting here for some reality crease
There's one big deadend in my head
And not a moment of peace

Crossfire, Rain King, with his cadillac kid
Marries every dictionary from his chain-yard bliss
His lips a fountain
His daylight sparks
He's got a shot in his kick forging the real, when
He's a steel drum, wedding ring, Pontiac door knob ten
His mind a countdown
His daylight sparks

Hung up on a speed king nation, caught up on a nail
Hanging tight with time, at least, a little while
Your sister is a beauty when she's naked, like my kid
I'm here in this world, cruel world, dreaming of a pitchfork kiss



Even the one you saw yesterday 
It looks different today 
Cause everything's changed since yesterday 
In every possible way 
Things seem different today 
Not like yesterday 

Is consideration 
More like an exception 
Of consideration? 

You held the world in your arms tonight 
And what if you held the world in your arms? 

When you're secure do you feel much safer? 
But days never change and it's three years later 
It's like your life 
Hasn't changed and it's three years late 
How does it feel to be three years late? 
And watching your youth drift away 
What seems different, seems different today? 
What seems different, seems different today? 

Is consideration 
More like an exception 
Of consideration 

You held the world in your arms tonight 
And what if you held the world in your arms? 
You held the world in your arms tonight 
And what if you held the world in your arms? 
Tonight 
Tonight



When I wake up tomorrow - I'm giving up
If nothing here has changed
When I wake up tomorrow - I'm taking off

October left some wounds
but it took a while to see
It's way to soon
to say what it's done to me

But as long as I'm ok
I want to figure it out myself
Let's just hope that in a day I'll find a way

December came today
and I'm just as bored as ever
No way I'll stay
I'll leave this place forever

I hope there's time to live a while before I die
and if some day I find that time I'll try
to make the cold winter months seem just like warm July
I hope there's time to live before I die

And as long as I'm ok I want to figure it out myself
Let's just hope that in a day I'll find my way



Greatest god's divine

Exhausting all the world into decline

His woman truly was a devil
And she wasn't all that honest
She tore him down on every level

You're a no good lazy motherfucker
Got a, a shit job you worthless motherfucker
You're a, a dead beat feel sorry for your mother
If I had time I'd trade you for another

He don't like that
He wants his life back
He wants to go back home

He tried so hard to please her
He sold his soul to keep her happy
But nothin' he did impressed her
She always left him feelin’ shitty

Gonna strike low just like my momma taught me
You're a, a low life you're lucky that you got me

He don't like that

Down deep way down inside him
The will to leave was growing stronger
And he bit his tongue for so long
He couldn't hold back any longer

You're a two faced ruthless instigator
You're a, a low down triflin' masquerader
You're a, a cold bitch controllin' conservator
This is too much I'm out I'll see you later

She don't like that
But he got his life back
No she don't like that
But he's right back on track
I said he went back home

Gone to war against obscenity
Well, in times like these
You better watch what you say
Watch 'em take your fucking rights away

Darlin' I've been falling down
Darlin' we've been and I'm falling down
Don't you wanna know? oh, oh, oh

Just a shame, just a drag, just the USA
More concerned about the things we say
And the lies they tell
I'll tell you that's what's unjust
What the fuck they've been telling us

Darlin' I've been falling down
Darlin' we've been fallin' down
Don't you take it away
Don't you wanna know? oh, oh, oh

And it's a long way down
And it's a long way down

Here come the witch hunt, black listin' fcc
Callin' out the fucking cavalry
When they come for you
Why don't you come to me?
As you sit through this insanity

Darlin' I've been fallin' down
Darlin' we've been fallin' down

Don't you take it away
Don't you take it away
Don't you wanna know? oh, oh, oh



As life slips away from you, reason has fled.
I hold you closer, give my warmth to your skin,
My eyes close tighter, fight the tears I'm crying.

Stay with me, love,
Stay with me here.
Life has no purpose if you can't be near,
We made a promise for eternity.

You are my love, you are my life.
I watch you leave, and extinguish my light.
Your skin against my lips feels alien to me,
A stone with softness, yielding unnaturally.

I love you more now,
You've gone from my life.
I'll never leave you,
On this cold, endless night.

Lying as one, lying, we two,
Warmth leaves my body and flows into you.
I don't know where you end or where I begin,
Falling to you, falling apart.

Red colours sheets, as it flows from your heart.
Such sweet surrender,
Slipping far from this room,
My dearest friend, I know I'll be with you soon.

I love you more now,
You've gone from my life.
I'll never leave you,
On this cold, endless night.

I love you more now,
You've gone from my life.
I'll never leave,
On this cold, endless night.

Rest now, my love,
Feel pain no more.
Sleep with the angels,
And come when I call.

I love you more now,
You've gone from my life.
I'll never leave,
On this cold, endless night.

I love you more now,
You've gone from my life.
I'll never leave you,
On this cold, endless night.

I love you more now,
You've gone from my life.
I'll never leave,
On this cold, endless night.

I love you more now,
You've gone from my life…



Nothing you could do that could turn me away
Hanging on every word believing the things I heard
Being a fool.

You've taken my life, so take my soul
That's what you said and I believed it all
I want to be with you long as you want me to
I won't move away.

Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Liar, liar, liar.

May I see no night?  May I see no day?
If I ever leave while you want me to stay
You can believe in me, I won't be leaving
I won't let you go.

Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Liar, liar, liar.

Liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar.



All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should like I should

Now all the critics wanna hit it
This hit, can how we did it
Just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from his critics

Do we always gotta cry always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast, it's moving really fast
You better stay on top, or life will kick you in the ass

Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid - so, what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when your starin' down the cable of a-
A mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette when you're placin' your bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and your done
'Cause I'ma be the one 'til I jet
I'ma be the one 'til I jet

'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Does anybody really know the secret
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meaning
But everything happens for a reason
everything happens for a reason
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, a microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' on my mind every second with my fist

Everybody wanna run wanna run
Everybody wanna hide from the gun from the gun
You can take a ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take that edge off that knife no, sir
And now you want your money back money back
But you're denied 'cause your brains fried from the sack
And there ain't nothing I can do
'Cause life is a lesson - you learn it when you're through

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately
Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

Now I know why...
Now I know why...
Now I know why...

Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!



Laughing, swirling high above the ground
People stop and check and watch her coming
Crazy little mama going 'round and 'round

Last time I touched her, she was burning
Through a heat of ever lasting light
Drifting through her fires my ceaseless yearning
Flaming little mama, will you burn all night?

Hey, will you burn all night?
Hey, will you burn all night?
Oh yeah

The first time I kissed her, I surrendered
Hands reached for the sky with no disgrace
Safe inside my love so warm and tender
Movin' little mama, it's your place, oh

Ooh, moving little mama
Come on, come on, come on

Ooh, will you burn all night?
Mmm, will you burn all night?
Will you?

Will, will you burn all night?
Ooh, can you burn all night?

The last time I saw her, she was running
Rollin' tumble fall on the ground
Mama always said she's got it coming
Crazy little mama, keep your dresses down

Crazy little mama
Crazy little mama, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy 
Crazy little mama
Crazy little mama, ma ma ma ma ma, yeah



I'm looking for that perfect line
To let you know you're always on my mind

Yeah, this is love - and I've learned enough to know
I'm never letting go
No, no, no - won't let go

When you want it - when you need it
You'll always have the best of me
I can't help it - believe it
You'll always get the best of me

I may not always know what's right
But I know I want you here tonight
Gonna make this moment last for all your life

Oh this is love - and it really means so much
I can tell from every touch
No, no, no - can't get enough

When you want it - when you need it
You'll always have the best of me
I can't help it - I believe it
You'll always get the best of me, yeah

No, no, no - won't let go

You'll always have the best of me
You'll always get the best of me
you'll always have the best of me
You'll always get the best of me

Oh, when you want it - when you need it
You'll always have the best of me
I can't help it - believe it
You'll always get the best of me

When you want it - when you need it
You'll always have the best of me
I can't help it - believe it
You'll always get the best of me



And I wish that I could be with you especially today
Standing right beside me is a man with a gun 
And he's waiting for the chance to shoot me down if I should run
'Cos I'm on the inside looking out 
And don't you know there's nothing I can do

Yes I'm sitting on the inside looking out
And I know that time is slowly running out

I've been here for seven long years doing time
And I just can't take much more of this, I'm gonna lose my mind
Standing close to me the warden looks me in the eye
I can hear him saying, "Boy, you're gonna be here till you die"
'Cos I'm on the inside looking out 
And don't you know there's nothing I can do

Yes I'm sitting on the inside looking out
And I know that time is slowly running out

As I write this letter there is something you should know
It's to tell you I don't think that I am ever coming home
So when you receive this note don't bother to reply
'Cos I don't want you to waste your life the way I've wasted mine
'Cos I'm on the inside looking out 
And don't you know there's nothing I can do
'Cos I'm on the inside looking out 
And don't you know there's nothing I can do



Why don't you show yourself?
We need you more than ever now.
Preacher, ever since you've gone,
This world's been going crazy,
Going crazy, going wrong.

This is a message to the sky,
This is a message to the sky,
This is a message to the sky,
You gotta help me,
You gotta help me,
You gotta help me to find
That certain something lacking here
In everybody's life.
You gotta give me something
I can live for here today
Give me something
I can believe in for today
There ain't one thing
We got going here today
That ain't just simply cruel.

Hey Jesus, who died for this technology
Saving time, it's just saving time,
Saving time ain't what we need,
Hey, hey, hey, something's going wrong,
That something somewhat missing
At the heart of everyone.

Call out my message,
My message to the sky
You gotta give me something
We can believe in for today
Give us something
We can live for here today
There ain't one thing
We got going here today
That ain't just sickly cruel.

Am I living with the human, human, human machines?
Human, human, human machines.


This is a message to the sky
This is a message to the sky
This is a message to the sky
You gotta help me
You gotta help me
You gotta help me somehow

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Give us something
We can live for here today
Give us something
We can believe in for today
There ain't one thing
We got going here today
That ain't just simply cruel



It's every little thing that makes you move
And there is a reflection in the mirror
You don't believe 
And darling it's so hard to understand
I wish that I could fix what you feel instead
Baby, why'd you do that, I can see through that
Give it a chance

And you can't just disappear
I'm begging you come on out, come on out
Promise that the coast is clear

I don't mind the chase
Baby, you're lost out there in a different place
And I can't get to you
I don't mind the chase
Baby, you're lost out there in a different place
And I can't get to you
But I'll do what I have to

Every little piece you pick apart
You've hidden in a corner of your heart
And there is a reflection in the mirror
That you don't see
And darling, it's an awful lot to give
A memory you chase but you can't relive
Baby, it's supposed to, baby you're close to
Letting me in

And you can't just disappear
I'm begging you come on out, come on out
Promise that the coast is clear


Oh, you never could quiet honestly explain
How much he means to you
You're doing everything they ask you to
There's a part of you, you wish you knew
And every escape you thought you could make
No, you did not think it would show
Darling it was way too much
Way to slow




I don't know. 
You just don't know what you're sayin'
Anymore.

You know beggers can't be chosers, 
And that's fair. 
When we win we may be losers, 
I don't care, no no no.
Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night, 
So come over and save me, 
Save me from another lonely night.
I hear every word you're sayin' 
They're all lies. 
But with every breath you're takin'
You're thinkin' of ways to say good night.



Then I saw you
Across the room
Taking in the sound of what was surrounding you

You looked around
At a lonely crowd
Trying everything to drown it out

I'm still unsure how you've done this, but here you are
And you're on your way into my heart
If you don't start slowing down
I saw it coming from the start
But I wondered
You're on your way now.

And I could not believe
When you looked at me
It's like you knew
That we'd have everything we'd need to see this through
And I couldn't find
A place to hide
So I just stared right back into your eyes

I'm still unsure how you've done this
But here you are.
You're on your way into my heart
If you don't start slowing down
I saw it coming from the start
But I wondered
Just how would it be if you hadn't believed in me.
You're on your way now.

And these are the days that we'll remember
And these are the days that we'll remember
And these are the days that we'll remember

And these are the days that we'll remember
And these are the days that we'll remember
And these are the days that we'll remember

You're on your way into my heart
If you don't start slowing down
I saw it coming from the start
But I wondered
Just how would it be if you hadn't believed in me.
You're on your way now



but feelin' shook instead,
Too many thoughts of you,
runnin' around my head,
All Goddamn day,
All Goddamn day,
All Goddamn day.

I know all your stupid games,
And all your tricks and plots,
You got my stomach tied,
You got it tied in knots,
All Goddamn day,
All Goddamn day,
All Goddamn day.

All Goddamn day,
All Goddamn day,
All Goddamn day,
All Goddamn day,
All Goddamn day.



That takes me away
From the place
Where I belong

The choices I made
Before guilt came
They're not right,
They are not wrong

You're in my head
I wrote you this song
Sometimes I think I belong
Maybe I'm sad
Maybe I'm glad
But I'm ready for the night


People are passing by
Living busy lives
Trying to forget
That part at night
Everyone's the same
Playing dirty games
Wondering if anyone
Will find out
How we really are
Selfish to the bone
I want what I need
And I'll have it now
You can't hold me down

I'm one a plane
That takes me away
From the place
Where I belong

The moments we shared
Are in the back of my head
I'll keep 'em there
For a while

It's important that I
Don't ever abide
Because you have a
Reason to stay
Maybe one day
When all fades away
I'll be knocking on
Your door



I don't deserve you
you can pinch my eyeball
darling sweetheart pain of great art
oh I cry so much
that I walk with my big red head in a diaper
baby I love your grandpa
we had hot fun in the pet store
with a friendly reptile
oh girl I feel my eyeball cuz you electric toothpick
you did put in it
darling sweetheart pain of great art
two three see me please
call emergency
oh I cry so much with my other eye
oh I walk with my blind head against the closet
oh girl>



Yes it's been decided you've done wrong
And their's no single voice
That will stand up and say
Oh just what has he done?
For they all read the news
And it's surely proof enough for them
And they flatly refuse to consider oh
Was he really to blame?

Cause when the fingers point... whoah
It's too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take
And when the fingers point... yeah
It makes your heart break

Now you're moving away
For you can not take it anymore
No amount of explaining can alter the truth
It's all happened before
Where can you go
Where can you go
Where the evil eyes won't follow on
And the curtains won't move
Every time you walk by
Boy just what have you done?

Cause when the fingers point... Oh
It's too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take
And when the fingers point... Oh
It makes your heart break

Too much to take

Too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take

So you find a new home and a new place to hide
Where's there's peace and shelter from the poison outside
But before too long I'll be staring at the walls
Don't kid yourself son, it's just a matter of time

Cause when the fingers point... Whoa Oh
Fingers point...
Oh when the fingers point
Makes your heart break
Cause when the fingers point... Oh
It's too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take
And when the fingers point... Oh
It makes your heart break


Too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take



This abyss of world destroyed
This abyss, all deep, all wide
This abyss of being denied

Even in the darkest forest
Fireflies are flickering
But not in this abyss of black increase
This abyss, without surcease

Even in the deepest ocean
There's a little moonlight
But not in this abyss of night unbound
This abyss, without a sound

Even in your bedroom shadows
There is something moving
But not in this abyss, this all-below
This abyss, this death, this "no"



Take away these feelings cuz they're bringing me down.
Cuz I can't breathe. Feels like I can't breathe.
Feels just like this whole world's coming down on me.

Oh, can I be forgiven for all I have done?

Can you set me free? Can you set me free?
Set me free from all this pain life's done to me.

If you can hear me praying, then I'll ask one more time.

Can you take it away, Lord? Oh, can I be forgiven?
Can you take it away, Lord? Help me change my ways of living.

Oh, can I be forgiven for all I have done?
Is there time for me? Is there still time for me?
Time to change whatever I've got left of me.

If you can hear me praying, then I'll ask one more time.

Can you take it away, Lord? Oh, can I be forgiven?
Can you take it away, Lord? Help me change my ways of living.

Echale.



Shivering out in the dark 
Hiding from the truth 
Cover up the proof 
Demons that I've tried to hide 
Imprison me in my own lies 
And all that I can do is cover up the proof 
Don't be afraid to... 

Stand up! 
Stand up if you're broken 
Stand up! 
Stand up if you feel ashamed 
You are not alone when you hurt this way 
Stand up! 
Stand up if you need love 
Stand up! 
This is not judgment day 
You don't have to hide 
There's no need to run 
Everything will be okay 

Secrets got me torn apart 
Trying to destroy my heart 
But I can see the light 
It's cutting through the night 
Don't run away 
Don't run away 
Don't be afraid to... 

You say You love me 
That's all I'll ever need 
If You say I'm good enough 
That's good enough for me



exaggerated at best who knows? i guess
and from what i surmise oh my! oh yes!
you've changed the world more or less
so says the press

hey mr. my hat is off to you
hey mr. my hat is off
i owe it all to you, i owe it all to you

with eloquence on your side no lie, no way
sincerity on your face alright, ok
and you look so dignified no lie, no way
my doubts are fully displaced my fears allay

trees are greener now
children laugh out loud
there is peace and harmony again
no pain or poverty
thanks to your policies
i heard it all on n.p. radio

then the birds will sing,
"thanks for everything!"
all the hindus bow
"thanks for the holy cows!"
in 2093, they'll curse your legacy
in 2094, they will exhume your corpse



Of noble feats and noble minds an entire lifetime out of petty crime
And eyes full of Pound signs an observer of what people do
Most people are when they've little to do flirting with danger
Flirting with a stranger it's what they'll always do
And I know while I'm alive it's what they'll do
And I know while I'm alive it's what they'll do it's what they'll do
Like a time bomb about to go off once bitten is not enough
Getting too close is something to do a fascinating pastime it is to
Amateur dramatic divorced from the pragmatic inherent lack of style
Rotund and robust and unbridled lust paralysed and blinkered
With no common sense no common sense
And I know while I'm alive it's what they'll do
And I know while I'm alive it's what they'll do it's what they'll do
The passenger who tried to get off the passenger who'd had enough
Rotund and robust unbridled lust it's never enough
It's never enough it's never enough
A life full of grand ideas a life full of grand designs
Of noble feats and noble minds an entire lifetime out of petty crime
Flirting with danger flirting with a stranger it's what they'll do
And I know while I'm alive it's what they do
And I know while I'm alive it's what they'll do
And I know while I'm alive it's what they'll do
And I know while I'm alive it's what they'll do



Somewhere she weeps, her hair gently brushes the floor
I know my way, I know that I'll find her somehow

Angela carries me back to the time
When I knew that her love was still mine
Angela's holding the child in her womb
And I pray that she will be calling soon

Cold moon, dark sky, I'm watching my mind disappear
She sits alone, not knowing that I am so near
Why can't she hear my voice as I call out her name

Angela carries me back to the time
When I knew that her love was still mine
Angela's holding the child in her womb
And I pray that she will be calling soon

It's a silly situation, it's just infatuation, no need to be sorry

Can't eat, can't sleep, can't seem to find time anymore
Somewhere she weeps, her hair gently brushes the floor
I know my way, I know that I'll find her somehow

Angela carries me back to the time
When I knew that her love was still mine
Angela's holding the child in her womb
And I pray that she will be calling soon

It's a silly situation, it's just infatuation, no need to be sorry



And if you ever feel down or feel small - Oh don't despair,
And if you ever feel lost or feel alone - Babe come on home.

Let's just make love - All night,
Let's just hold on - So tight,
Let's make it last - For life,
I won't let you go.

Yeah we're flying,
Feels just like flying,
We're such a long way up,
From the ground,
Just you and me flying,
So high and I'm never gonna come down.

Every time you turn around and wanna run - Oh come to me,
When every little dream comes undone - Oh don't worry.

Let's just make love - All night,
Let's just hold on - So tight,
Let's make it last - For life,
I won't let you go.

Yeah we're flying,
Feels just like flying,
We're such a long way up,
From the ground,
Yeah - Just you and me flying,
So high and I'm never gonna come down - No.

Yeah it's just you and me,
Oh let's just make love - All night,
Let's just hold on - So tight,
Let's make it last - For life,
I won't let you go.

Yeah we're flying,
Feels just like flying,
Ohh, we're such a long way up,
Ohh, from the ground,
Yeah we're flying,
Yeah we're flying, 
Feels just like flying,
Feels like flying,
We're such a long way up,
A long, long way up, from the ground,
Yeah we're flying,
So high and,
We're never gonna come down,
You and me.



Since I can't remember when
Thinking about the world I didn't know
And how I wanted it
But now I'm fighting in the thick of it
And feeling so alone
I take a chance, just one more chance
To get me anywhere

It's like I'm running down every road but home

And now I'm running
I'm moving too fast
So we would know ohh
And where I'm headed to
It's nobody's guess
So here we go ohh
So here we go ohh

I saw the map like any other would
Looking to find and follow lines
That led me to questions
But I can see it in the symmetry
It's what was really always meant to be
The singularity is clear from the distance

So I'm dying here to fall in love with home

And now I'm running
I'm moving too fast
So here we go ohh
And where I'm headed to
It's nobody's guess
So here we go ohh
So here we go ohh

Staring into mirrors
Lost in my design
Believing dreams and wait for signs
You will always find me when I run away
So I will not slow down
Until I make it back into your arms this time ahh

And now I'm running
I'm moving too fast
So here we go ohh
And where I'm headed to
It's nobody's guess
So here we go ohh

And now I'm running
I'm moving too fast
So here we go ohh-a-woah
And where I'm headed to
You don't have to guess
So here we go ohh-a-woah
I'm headed home ohh-a-woah
I'm headed home ohh



I can act just like your brother
I can dress just like your mother
I can be but I don't bother
In a minute, in a minute
I can be these things
In a minute, don't you get it?
Don't you get it?
If I were to be as cruel as I could be
Would you like to still give all of your life to me?
In a minute, in a minute
I can be these things
In a minute, don't you get it?
Don't you get it?
I can be just like the others
I can act just like your brother
I can dress just like your mother
I can be but I don't bother
In a minute, in a minute
I can be these things
In a minute, don't you get it?
Don't you get it?



Maybe I don't wanna maybe I don't wanna, wanna
Maybe I don't wanna fuck you!

I'm a spinster, I don't need no rules
I don't got no one tellin' me what to do
Tellin' me what's cool? I'm no stupid fool

Hey teen ageist I'm not over yet
Y-O-U-T-H only, baby, that's your math
I'm a spinster, I don't need your rules
I'm resisting, I don't need no one to
Tell me what's cool or how I need a tool
To get thru to you

I'm no one's wife and' I'm not your little girl
Don't tell me I'm useless cuz I want
More from this world

Maybe I don't wanna maybe I don't wanna, wanna
Maybe I don't wanna maybe I don't wanna
Maybe I don't wanna maybe I don't wanna, wanna
Maybe she don't wanna fuck you!
Hey ever think of that?



Boys and girls in America, they have such a sad time together
Sucking off each other at the demonstrations, making sure their makeup's straight
Crushing one another with colossal expectations, dependent, undisciplined, sleeping late

She was a really cool kisser and she wasn't all that strict of a Christian
She was a damn good dancer but she wasn't all that great of a girlfriend
He likes the warm feeling but he's tired of all the dehydration
Most nights are crystal clear but tonight it's like he's stuck between stations
On the radio

The Devil and John Berryman, they took a walk together
And they ended up on Washington talking to the river
He said, "I've surrounded myself with doctors and deep thinkers.
Their big heads and soft bodies make for lousy lovers."

There was that night that we thought John Berryman could fly
But he didn't, so he died
She said "You're pretty good with words, but words won't save your life."
And they didn't, so he died

Yeah, he was drunk and exhausted, he was critically acclaimed and respected
He loved the Golden Gophers but he hated all the drawn-out winters
He likes the warm feeling but he's tired of all the dehydration
Most nights were kind of fuzzy but that last night he had total retention

Yeah, these Twin City kisses
They sound like clicks and hisses
We all come down and drowned
In the Mississippi River

We drink and we dry up and now we crumble into dust
We get wet and we corrode and now we're covered up in rust
We drink and we dry up and now we crumble into dust
We get wet and we corrode and now we're covered up in rust

She was a really cool kisser and she wasn't all that strict of a Christian
She was a damn good dancer but she wasn't all that great of a girlfriend
He likes the warm feeling but he's tired of all the dehydration
Most nights are crystal clear but tonight it's like he's stuck between stations

And these Twin City kisses
They sound like clicks and hisses
We all come down and drowned



My cheeks are hollow as I feel

You're really gonna hate this
I still can dial your number in the dark
But whenever I pull
I'm pushing us further apart

I keep my fragments of you in a closet bottom bag
And I take them out and stitch them up

Caught in the open in the rained out parade of you

You're really gonna hate this
I still can dial your number in the dark
But whenever I pull
I'm pushing us further apart

You're really gonna hate this
Pieces of you swimming in my brain
Drenched to the bone
Waiting for you in the rain

And it pours

Life becomes the things you're putting off
If you're not sure what you've turned on
I should just throw this bag away

Caught in the open in the rained out parade of you
Fumbling for cover in the rained out parade of you

You're really gonna hate this
But my fingers know your number in the dark
Whenever I call it
I'm pushing us further apart

You're really gonna hate this
Pieces of you swimming in my brain
Drenched to the bone
Waiting for you in the rain

I'll take back what you took from me
I'll hide where you won't look for me
And I can't see that being too hard



It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything
And I can't deal with that

I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
We'll blow it away, blow it away
Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
Because a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killin' me, but you're the only one 
It's not over

I've taken all I could take and I cannot wait
We're wastin' too much time
Bein' strong, holdin' on
Can't let it bring us down

My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
I'll blow it away, blow it away
Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
Because a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killin' me, but you're the only one 
It's not over

We can't let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself
Let it out

Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
Because a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killin' me, but you're the only one 
It's not over

Let's start over
It's not over, yeah, yeah
This love is killin' me, but you're the only one
It's not over



And I saw you running
It seems everywhere you go
In the wooden floors of my house
They're out to get you
In a way I couldn't see you
And then you regret
And they're not safe buildings
Should have stayed at home in bed
When the walls are out of focus
Nervous instead
And I wish that I could save you
Each time

1:56
And you're so glad
No one can see
Inside of your tireless mind



And from the sky the ashes rained
As we danced
Lost in cities paved with gold
Their promises of fortune told
As we hide
Walls are breaking on us all

Don't leave me out here
One more day on my own
Can't give you up
Can't carry on
Don't leave me out here
One more night on my own
Can't give you up
Can't carry on

To catch the fire from the light
As we hide
From sleeping giants where they lie
And this time

I don't know when I'll be leaving
Maybe I have seen the burning of the sun
I believe in, I believe in
Miracles for some of us



You can have me, but you can't have my heart,
It's easy enough to say but I couldn't care less,
Yeah I might've told you you were on my mind, 
But, guess I talk a pretty good line,
Hey I could talk all day,
But I just can't confess,


That I'm a liar,
I'm a victim of desire,
I'm moth into the fire,
Yeah I'm over my head - forget what I said,
Tell ya I'm a liar,
I'm just walking on the wire,
That I couldn't get much higher,
Yeah I'm over my head - forget what I said,
Baby I'm a liar.

Yeah when I told you I was hard to pin down,
Ya know I was just messin' around,
Guess you know by now that that's just my way,
And if you want stories - well I got a few,
But hey, this is the truth I swear to you,
Yeah how many more times do you want me to say,


Yeah - if I told you to go away,
Baby you can't believe a thing I say,
Listen...

I'm a liar,
I'm a victim of desire,
I'm moth into the fire,
Yeah I'm over my head - forget what I said,
Baby I'm a liar,
I'm just walking on the wire,
No I couldn't get much higher,
Well I'm over my head - forget what I said,
Baby I'm a liar,
I'm a liar,
Well I'm over my head, forget what I said,
I'm a liar - liar,
I can't help myself,
I'm a liar,
Well I'm over my head - forget what I said
No you can't believe a single thing I say,
Oh yeah - I'm a liar.



You look like a person I'd like to meet


Doesn't really have a thing on you
And I don't know what it is
I care nothing for you
I care nothing for you
Doesn't really have a thing on you
And I don't know what it is

I cannot look you in the eye
I get so nervous when I try

Doesn't really have a thing on you
And I don't know what it is
I care nothing for you
I care nothing for you
I care nothing for you
I care nothing for you

I care nothing for you
I care nothing for you
I care nothing for you
I care nothing for you



on the banks that day
as we left the world behind
it was upstream then
like it's upstream now
in this livelong outside
there's a trestle across the water
like my hands across that year
for a moment the green was mine 

And our footsteps worn
from years of rain
and it held my hand
like it holds my name
and my childhood born
and the difference
the water washed away
the water washed away

I'm bruised and red
from the pain of rock
stepping stones until I fall
and daggers when I land
a roman candle in my hand
was a weapon to the outside
and I walked in my father's wake
I prayed to a god to take
the endlessness of those shores

And our footseps worn
from years of rain
and he held my hand
he still holds my name
and my childhood born
and the difference
We let the water wash away
the water washed away

The water washed away
the water washed away
the water washed away
the water took it all
all away

Those sacred trails
by the waterside left
to other soulssoles without love or hate
they're bleeding the everything
they're soiling the brilliant green
and I'm drowning for the water's sake

our footsteps worn
from years of rain
and he held my hand
and I still hold his name
and my childhood born
and the difference
I let the water wash away

The water washed away

Let the water wash away
I let the water wash away
The water washed away
Washed it all
The water washed it all away

I let the water wash away
I let the water wash away
The water washed away
away
Water washed it all away
washed it all away
away

The water washed away
the water washed away
the water washed away
take it all away
all away

There was blue green clay
on the banks that day
as we left the world behind

Haunting me now, reminders of how I used to be
And on down the road my troubles are sure to follow
Looking out the window, the hell if I know where I will go
So I'll just keep on driving

On my way to LA looking into the rear view as the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past, the first to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line just changed my mind, well it's my heart that I'll follow this time

Who would've known that pride is so hard to swallow
As I rest on the shoulder of a road growing colder
With the trouble I own, should I just keep on driving?

On my way to LA looking into the rear view as the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past, the first to last bad call that I've ever made
Tell me how to make right every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line just changed my mind, well it's my heart that I'll follow this time

I know I must be doing something right
Head the other way, back to where I started out
Ask myself if I can turn it all around tonight
Stop living with doubt

On my way to LA looking into the rear view as the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past, first to last bad call that I've ever made
Tell me how to make right every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line just changed my mind, well it's my heart that I'll follow this time

I've sworn off my past, first to last bad call that I've ever made
Well it's my heart that I'll follow this time
I've sworn off my past, first to last bad call that I've ever made

I'm gonna turn it all around tonight
Turn it all around tonight
Turn it all around tonight
I'm gonna turn it all around tonight at the Tennessee line



There is a change in the atmosphere. 
This has been more complicated than we've imagined
Write this down in letters
Send them far from here
You can count the miles but it won't hid how close they feel

Let it go
The worst is over Yeah, its over
You're moving way to fast. Yeah, moving way to fast

Confidence runs through your fingertips
You've never felt so alive
Addressed for the occasion
If gravity takes its toll you will never know what it's like to forget him
So stand tall 

Let it go
The worst is over Yeah, its over
You're moving way to fast Yeah, moving way to fast
For all we know the worst is over 
Let it go
The worst is over Yeah, its over
You're moving way to fast Yeah, moving way to fast
For all we know the worst is over
Let's put this in the past Yeah, put this in the past
Did you think that this would last?
This changes everything we know Let it go



I see her now
I think I hear her calling now
Hear her calling now
That lady of flowers
And her softs spell
Her sweet taste
Takes me far from his place
Oh and the love train
The love train is in the station now
In the station now

That old devil man
Deep down there
In his fire home
Rose up knee high
With his song of desire
Words of deceit
Dropped there at my feet
Now outside my door he stands
That old man of shadowAnd his shadow band
For downn the thorny road
Are we bound
Without light
Without soundAnd he's knocking
On my door
He says
It's time we were going boy
Donwn that old road of sorrow

And now he's walking
There beside me
That old man of shadow
Now there's this girl
He says you can't forsake
This girl it's said
You're bound to take
He says
The Coal Train
Is due here soon
Is due here soon

It'll come in time
Yes it's coming soon
It'll draw in close
Oh no I say
Not this one
Not this one for that coal train
Not this one
For your cold coal train

I had no love
For her skinny waist
I had no love
For her at all
Just a need
Just a need
When she stole me
Along by the roadside

And rattled the tin strings
Of my body blue
Oh I'm getting older now
I'm getting older

Walking down that road
With that old man of shadow
That old man of shadow
And it's growing darker now
And night is ever near
Night is ever near
Oh here it comes again
Here it comes again
The Coal Train baby
That Coal Train tonight
The Coal Train baby
The cold coal train



Your head rolling away
I catch it when it falls
I keep it 'neath my breath

So what have we become?
More than skin and bone?
And what could beat this love?
Except heroin

This is where we awake
This is where we don't ache

I see the sun, but it's never quite as close
As the only one, and I, I can't hardly wait

So give me sweet, sweet soul
Oh, give me what you take
Oh, give me all that sleeps inside you
Bid me what never awakes

So what have we become?
More than skin and bone?
And when do we come down?
I don't care anymore

This is where we awake
This is where we don't ache

I see the sun, but it's never quite as close
As the only one, and I, I can't hardly wait
I see the sun, but it's never quite as close
As the only one and I can't hardly wait



There will be evil that tries to disable
They fight, take, start wars
Try to make you take the poison
Try to get some kind of reaction
You don't need this situation
Ignore the irritation

Get your groove one

Some will annoy you
And bore you as they do
Just stop, think, calm, walk
Rise above this aggravation
Do not give in to temptation
You don't need this situation
Ignore the irritation

Get your groove on



Leave those compliments well behind 
Dig a little deeper into yourself 
And you may find 

Come over here just sit right down 
Needn't comb your hair, needn't pout or frown 
I hear you've turned our young men 
Into dribbling clowns 

36D so what D so what 
Is that all that you've got? 
36D so what D so what 
Is that all that you've got? 

Make their day and go ahead 
Remove your clothes lie on the bed 
Just a last gasp chance or an outside bet 
To the easily led 

And before you do just what you do 
Here' one thought for you to chew 
The men who run the business that you sell 
They screw you too 

36D so what D so what 
Is that all that you've got? 
36D so what D so what 
Is that all that you've got? 

You're just another 365 night stand 
But you're so handy, you're so handy 
You cheapen and you nasty every woman in this land 
But you're so handy, you're so handy 

Your picture's hanging pretty on the squaddies' walls 
You're Steven's, Andy's, you're Ian's, you're Paul's 
Your body's thought of fondly in the rugby mauls 
But you want more

Your name is always mentioned in the jokes and cracks
Your Coach and Horses and your Woolpacks
Your poses turn the passive into maniacs
But you want more

36D so what D so what
Is that all that you've got?
36D so what D so what
Is that all that you've got?
36D so what D so what
Is that all that you've got?
36D so what D so what
Is that all that you've got?

36D so what, so what
36D so what, so what
36D so what, so what
36D so what

He was trying to save his job



Cause there's nothing left to lose
And I believe deeply in myself as in you 
With every word I infuse!
Right!
Alive
Tonight

Come on gather round let's sing a song 
Take my hand and we can come a full 
Circle cause it has been far to long 
Will you show me the way cause I've been Lost 
Life comes with a cost 
Oh no 
oh ho ho

Wanna lose my mind 
The absence of time 
Dreamed of this moment
For most of my life!

All that matters is we are here tonight 
You and me as the light of the new day shines 
All that matters is we are here tonight 
Feeling so free as our hearts will scream inside 
Tonight

Have to run away from all the pain 
Get away before it catches me 
Show me how to release yesterday 
Where my love turned a resentful gray 
So tonight I will stay. 
Oh no 
Oh ho ho

Wanna lose my mind 
The absence of time 
Dreamed of this moment
For most of my life!

All that matters is we are here tonight 
You and me as the light of a new day shines 
All that matters is we are here tonight 
Feeling so free as our hearts will scream inside 
Oh scream inside
Oh scream inside 

Tonight 
Whoa-no
Oh-ho-ho

Wanna lose my mind 
The absence of time 
Dreamed of this moment
For most of my life!

All that matters is we are here tonight 
You and me as the light of the new day shines 
All that matters is we are here tonight 
Feeling so free as our hearts will scream inside 

Let love shine bright 
Absense of night
As love burns bright
We will survive

Alive
Tonight
Can't stop 
This light

in the backrow of the theatre
sitting side by side

she'll be mine oh mine
when they turn out the lights

dracula & frankenstien appears on the screen
together with the meanest creatures you ever seen
gently i put my hand on her lap
she leaves me with a broken nose
from a solid planted slab

yeah im a monster movie fan
in the backrow of the theatre
sitting side by side
im a horrorpicture freak
she'll be mine oh mine

Guilt trip cocktail, thorny crown 
Rosy glasses they see just right 
Softening the choices of crash or flight 

Frowning suit man keeping time 
Closed an eye to nature's rhyme 
Hopes a mint will save his breath 
Got an elevator speech for Mr. Death 

Swampy waters seem so warm 
Simming with the devil to the candy store 

Somewhere angels are frowning, but I need a good dream, as good as it gets 
Don't touch me, I'm still expanding, just one more bullet for my Russian roulette

Crack boy loads his mojo kit, 
Flicks the light and takes a hit
Cuz early to rise and early to bed
Makes one healthy, rich, and dead 

Ken has got another doll
Broke the last one, broke them all
When they learn to laugh again
Come and pulls the velvet chain

Swampy waters seem so warm 
Simming with the devil to the candy store 

Somewhere angels are frowning, but I need a good dream, as good as it gets 
Don't touch me, I'm still expanding, just one more bullet for my Russian roulette

Like a handle in the hand
A ticket to whatever land
Get yourself a holy cow
Cancel any time but now

Somewhere angels are frowning, but I need a good dream, as good as it gets 
Don't touch me, I'm still expanding, just one more bullet for my Russian roulette

Touching you everywhere
Where I've never been before
I can't believe that I
Believe I've finally opened your door

Whispered words to silent ears
They've all been said before
Or will you run and hide so safe inside
Open the door

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Then again nothing kills me
Nothing heals me like you do, like you do
Nothing kills me
Nothing heals me like you do

Angel angel with an attitude
Mend my wings of solitude
And help me fly again
Angel Angel

Sanctify a broken lie
Can you hold the flame
That dares to set alight
Your darkest night
Open the door

Up here in no mans land
Where the moment is so real
I wondered about that star
And where you are. I've opened your door

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Then again nothing kills me
Nothing heals me like you do, like you do
Nothing kills me nothing heals me like you do

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Then again nothing kills me
Nothing heals me like you do, like you do
Nothing kills me nothing heals me like you do

Angel angel with an attitude
Mend my wings of solitude
And help me fly again



I can't hear a word they're sayin',
Only the echoes of my mind.

People stoppin' starin'
I can't see their faces,
Only the shadows of their eyes.

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Thru the pourin' rain,
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes.

Backin' off the northeast wind and,
Sailin' on a summer breeze,
Trippin' over the ocean like a stone.

Woh Woh Woh

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Thru the pourin' rain,
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes.

Backin' off the northeast wind,
Sailin' on a summer breeze,
Trippin' over the ocean like a stone,
Like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me.

Woh Woh Woh



I am all turned around
Your salt in the wound that hasnt healed

You were near now your far
So now we missed the mark
And the road back to you is no more

I think im just dead to you woah
The signals not coming through no
So this is goodbye to you goodbye to you

What should have been
Could have been
A happy end
Say it slowly
I might have been
The best of them
I didnt win
The saddest story I know

My enemy is the life you cant see
And the days turn to years there is no cure

I think im just dead to you woah
The signals not coming through no
So this is goodbye to you

What should have been
Could have been
A happy end
Say it slowly
I might have been
The best of them

I didn't win
The saddest story I know

Gonna get you now
Gonna get you now
Ill find a way to win you back

You refuse to beleive
In a life
Spent with me
Whos to blame
I know ive done this before

What should have been
Could have been
A happy end
Say it slowly
I might have been
The best of them
I didnt win
The saddest story

What should have been
Could have been
A happy end

What should have been
Could have been
A happy end

The saddest story I know



It happened way too fast
I told myself
There's no way it would last
Is this how love's supposed to feel?
Is this how love's supposed to feel?

And all my friends
Are saying it's not right
I want to sleep
Beside you every night
Is this how love's supposed to feel?
Is this how love's supposed to feel?

So say you'll stay
I promise I won't go
There's just one thing
I really need to know
Is this how love's supposed to feel?
Is this how love's supposed to feel?

Is this how love's supposed to feel?
Is this how love's supposed to feel?
Is this how love's supposed to feel?
Is this how love's supposed to feel?



And the day is winding down
I'll be rolling on back to your arms
I'll be coming round 
When the sun goes down

They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
I've lived to find that is true
Somehow it don't seem so bad
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

One step closer
Love is coming into view
One step closer to heaven
One step closer to you

We went down to the river's edge
And walked along the sand
We lay down in its shadowy bed
The water rushed past our heads
I thought of something you said

That brought me back to the high mountain lake
In the West where I first met you
All around walls are coming down
But our love still stands true
Our love is still standing

One step closer
Love is coming into view
One step closer to heaven
One step closer to you

Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night
Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight - ya that's right
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
Where you gonna hide when it all comes down
Don't look back don't ever turn around

Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night



I find myself out in the cold
An eastward murder caught me staggering
You're here but I'm alone

In the phosphor blue of this night time
All our lies freeze hazy
Your smiles are knives they tear me
As your shadow turns you ugly

But it's alright 'cause you didn't mean to
But it's alright 'cause you don't know what you did
Yeah, it's alright now
You brought me right back down to where I started

With an offering her words hang heavy
And it won't be long before they come down
I was mystified they rang so easy
surprised myself and followed her out

And they will come sweeping over
Picking up what's left of you

And I will keep my hand steady
And I will keep myself ready



Every day
Cold hands, she reaches for the cigarettes to warm the day
She can't say

She needs more sympathy
She needs more of everything

Another kiss, another pill
She believes in a bigger thrill
She might just kill again
Move on
To the next life

She finds too much interference on the radio
It's nine below
So blind, she walks into the distance
And fades away, away, away, away...

High-fiving emptiness
She's gone too far to confess

Another day, another lie
Searching for that perfect high
She might just kill again
Move on
To the next life

She might just kill again
Move on
Move on
She moves on
Move on
Move on
To the next life

Oh-ohh-ohhhh
Yeah yeah
Bye bye
Bye bye

Cold hands reach for cigarettes



Baby, I'm not sure if this is love
And love can make us greedy
Baby i don't think that's for us
It's not for me to be

Lovers keep their distance
Maybe they don't like what they see
And love can make us jealous
Baby there's no right for me to be
It's not for me to see

If we give in
Maybe we'll be like them
I don't want the sadness
To be ours too
Baby there's no pressure
On you

Lovers keep their secrets 
Baby, I'm not sure if this is love
And love can make us greedy
Baby i don't think that's for us
It's not for me to be

F we give in
Maybe we'll be like them
I don't want the sadness
To be ours too
Baby there's no pressure

Overs keep their secrets 
Baby, I'm not sure if this is love
On you



you rain on my parade
darlin' you, you always win

and still I aplogize
all that twinkle in your eyes
baby you, you always win

when lovers on high go strollin' by
what am I to do?
they start a-whisperin' nothin's
make me think about somethin'
makin' sweet love to you

I know before we begin
and all the results are in
baby you, you always win

when lovers on high go strollin' by
what am I to do?
they start a-whisperin' nothin's
make me think about somethin'
makin' sweet love to you

I know before we begin
and all the results are in
baby you, you always win

baby you, you always win
always win
you always win
always win
you always win
always win...



As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart

You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart 

Oh Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

I see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart

Oh Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know 
It's comin' straight from the heart

Oh
Don't ever leave me darlin'

Oh straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go- as long as I know 
You'll give it to me now
Straight from the heart 
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go-as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart
Give it to me
Oh no, oh no 
Straight from the heart 
You know I'll never go-as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart



i'd give it back
if i could i'd let it all go,
make a move over again
just like we never met
let me out
make it stop
i want out
fill me up

baby i don't want what i got
let's say with hindsight
a cosmic relief
the grass is greener
on the other side
i don't wanna lie
let me out
make it stop
i want out
fill me up

don't be upset
i'm coming out
this empty closet
everything i said
i didn't mean it

baby i don't want what i got
i see her walking down the street
i wonder how
she makes ends meet
i wanna share
everything inside
i just might
do you in
not tonight
not again

baby i'm not
i'm not what you want
i drink and drive,
toss and turn,
play some games
and get burned everytime
i don't wanna lie
let me out
make it stop
i want out
fill me up

don't be upset
i'm coming out
this empty closet
everything i said
i didn't mean it

and i never been so much
in love
everytime i hate you
you give me love
i'm on probation
out of your prison of love
i can't help it i am sick
of your love
sick of love i know
that after sunshine
comes the rain
i'll regognize this as
self-inflicted again
and again
i get lost in your love
i am a fool for your love
i am sick of your love
because it's real.



Never say no - Try anything twice,
'Til the angels come - And ask me to fly,
Gonna be 18 'til I die - 18 'til I die.

Can't live forever - That's wishful thinkin',
Who ever said that - Must've been drinkin',
Don't wanna grow up - I don't see why,
I couldn't care less if time flies by.

18 'til I die - Gonna be 18 'til I die,
Yeah - It sure feels good to be alive,
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55 - 18 'til I die,
Ohh right.

Anyway - I just wanna say,
Why bother with what happened yesterday,
It's not my style - I live for the minute,
If ya wanna stay young get both feet in it - 18 'til I die.

A little bit of this - A little bit of that,
A little bit of everything - Gotta get on track,
It's not how ya look - It's what ya feel inside,
I don't care when - I don't need to know why.

18 'til I die - Gonna be 18 'til I die,
Yeah - It sure feels good to be alive,
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55 - 18 'til I die,
Yeah - There's one thing for sure - I'm sure gonna try.

Yeah - Don't worry about the future - Forget about the past,
Gonna have a ball - Yeah - We're gonna have a blast,
Gonna make it last - Hey.

18 'til I die - Gonna be 18 'til I die,
Yeah - It sure feels good to be alive,
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55 - 18 'til I die,
Gonna be - 18 'til I die - All right!
I'm gonna be 18' til I die.



But not too special, really really cute though
The way you look at me
Is gonna wear my heart out
And Trouble stands laughing hard now
He's waiting by my door
Mother nature what is the story here
And what is it for
I'm not awake today
And I'm not asleep tonight
I've got some principles
And now they'll have to fight
What's that moving breaking my line
Now make a circle come on roll into mine
What's that curving and breaking my line
Now make a circle come on roll into mine

Your strange perfume,
Fresh coffee and the morning light
Casts a shadow that slowly grows on to your right
Some say that it's wrong
Some say that it's fine
What's that moving and breaking my line
make a circle roll into mine



Somewhere along the way my sadness turned to bitterness
Somewhere along the way my bitterness turned to anger
Somewhere along the way my anger turned to vengeance

And the ones that I make pay are never the ones who deserve it
And the ones who deserve it, they'll never understand it
Yes, I know I am going to hell in a purple basket
At least I will be in another world while you're pissing on my casket

How could you be
So perfect for me?
Why can't you ignore
The things I did before?

Somewhere along the way exacting vengeance gave excitement
Somewhere along the way that excitement turned to pleasure
Somewhere along the way that pleasure turned to madness
Sooner or later that kind of madness turns into pain

And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserved it
Those who helped me along the way, I smacked them as I thanked them
Yes, I know I am going to hell in a leather jacket
At least I will be in another world, while you're pissing on my casket

All that I can do is sing a song of faded glory
And all you got to do is sit there, look great and make them horny
Together we will sing songs and tell exaggerated stories
About the way we feel today and tonight and in the morning

How could you be
So perfect for me?
Why can't you ignore
The things I did before?

And take all your fears
Pretend they're all true
And take all your plans
Pretend they fell through

And that's what it's like
That's what it's like for most people in this world
The rich or the poor
Muslims or Jews
When roles are reversed
Opinions are too, no

That's all I'm gonna say now
Before they come knockin' on my door now



Lots of back washing and sticks of paper 
Sticks of paper lighting the way 
If you find you don't know where your going 
It's in the bush, it's in the trees 
I'm gonna run round there twice 
It's too quick, it's too late 
It's much too quick and it's far too late 

I'm rolling away 
And I'm rolling away, and I'm rolling away for the last time 
And I'm hauling away, and I'm hauling away 
Too many things left unsaid 
And I'm rolling away, and I'm rolling away 
Somebody here is talking 
And I'm hauling away, and I'm hauling away, 
Somebody here is sober 

Somebody here is older 
Macbeth times 2 
A lazy suit and bloody hands 
Come taste your faith in every street 
The sound of money just kissed me in the face 
My trousers aren't the right size 
I go straight to pocket 
Take one step up and back to business 
My mind is closed so my body speaks 
My mind is clothed, my body squeaks 

And I'm rolling away, and I'm rolling away 
And I'm facing my only true smile 
And I'm hauling away, and I'm hauling away 
Somebody there is calling 
So I'm rolling away, I'm rolling away 
A sound of time is talking 
And I'm hauling away, and I'm hauling away 
This party here is too loud 

Nobody knows what clothes they're wearing 
Nobody knows which road is the white one 
So here we go holding up the motion 
You raise your hopes, you raise your chin 
You raise your glass with nothing in it 

It's a momentary lapse, a common habit 
Support your faith with this party face, and party pieces, 
And with their party faces, and party people 
With their powdered faces 

Just rolling away, just rolling away, just rolling away, 
Just rolling... 
Raintime, raintime, raintime...

Five o'clock and these walls - Just move in closer,
You get home so down and worn out - It's understood,
Yeah, it fits ya good,
Oh, fits ya good,
Yeah, it fits ya good. 

Was a time - You were bringin' me down,
But I know - It's just the way you look at life,
But you don't know like I know, baby,
I did all that I could,
Now it fits ya good,
Oh, it fits ya good,
Yeah, it fits ya good, oh baby.

'Cause you don't know, oh no,
I did all that I could,
Now it fits ya good,
Oh, fits ya good,
Yeah, it fits ya good, oh baby,
Fits ya good.



This is all you took

From all the years that you put in



Doesn't amount to much

But some things you can't throw aside

Even though you've finally moved on



Come on, I tell you: be strong, come on

We're not just back where we started from

Ready for another rise and fall



Who were you then?

How did you change?

Why did you bring it to an end?



Didn't amount to much

But some things you can't throw aside

Even when you finally move on



It's entirely yours to be done

You're not just back where you started from

Trying to risk another rise and fall

Rise and fall



Who were you running from?



It's entirely yours to be done

You're not just back where you started from

Ready for another rise and fall



Come on, I tell you: be strong, come on

We're not just back where we started from

Ready for another rise and fall



Rise and fall



I been lookin' for a woman I have not met
I have not found her yet
Til' I do it's a sure fire bet
I'll be drinkin' and smokin' cigarettes

I been winkin' at a woman by the name of Annette
Shes as easy, as easy as women get
But we don't have no regret
She's a gal that can do so let
Me keep drinkin' and smoking cigarettes

Lucky strike filters every night n' day
A shot of Jack Black an' I'm ready to play
I know it ain't healthy but it's quite alright
Til' I find a woman better than Lucky Strikes

Yeah I been thinkin' that I got no reason to fret
And I'm certain that my life ain't over yet
I'll slow down someday you bet
With my pole an' fishin' net
I'll quit drinkin' and smokin' cigarettes

Lucky strike filters every night n' day
A shot of Jack Black an' I'm ready to play
I know it ain't healthy but it's quite alright
Til' I find a woman better than Lucky Strikes

I been drinkin' and smokin' cigarettes
I been lookin' for a woman I have not met
I have not found her yet
Til' I do it's a sure fire bet
I'll be drinkin' and smokin cigarettes

Lucky strike filters every night n' day
A shot of Jack Black an' I'm ready to play
I know it ain't healthy but it's quite alright
Til' I find a woman better than Lucky Strikes



'Cause you know I won't be far from you
I need you by my side 'cause you make things right
I wanna feel what you feel
The warmth of love that's real
Straight from your heart
Don't wanna be apart
'Cause you make things right

Let the rain fall down above my head
I'll let your love keep me dry
You are the axis that keeps my world turning
You are my earth and sky

I find my strength in your smile
And it makes my life worthwhile
Oh yes it does-it comes from love
You've got my heart and my soul
And together we will grow old
I know it's true
My love's for you

I would lay the world right at your feet
Pull the stars out of the sky
Anything you ask I'll do for you
And your love's the reason why



brighter than the California sun
I say girl are you all right?
you know I can't believe
the way you shine tonight
A northern treasure
measure for measure
and I don't know whether
she was heaven sent
but she pays the rent

Everyone she knows
is always telling her
that she could do better
but she don't really mind
'cause we have a good time
when we're together
maybe there is something
in the water
or blame it on the weather
but we're doing fine
just me and my northern girl

There I go
Mr rock and roll
living on the dole
running with the boys -
we'll raise some hell tonight
come on and make some noise !
when we're together
I'm under pressure
we're from different worlds -
me and my northern girl

Everyone she knows
is always telling her
that she could do better
but she don't really mind
'cause we have a good time
when we're together
maybe there is something
in the water
or blame it on the weather
but we're doing fine
just me and my northern girl

She's my northern girl
and we're doing fine 

Yeah



Up above, a jet plane passing in the night
Left behind, a life you've known too long
Just ahead, a new horizon glows

Date and time of day are quite discarded
Lying among the postcards in your drawer
Day to day concerns left by the wayside
Forgotten in your quest for something more

The GNP slides lower every day
The government is crumbling so they say
But temporal things will never hold you back

A shining sinking land is in your eyes
A shining land
A sinking land



Have you ever been to Rhodes
In the falling rain?

Blowin' like a hurricane
Blowin' down the road that you left behind
Think of me and you know it, I'm not for anyone
But love is all around and it's for everyone

Have you ever been to Stalingrad?
Have you ever seen the light
That you knew was there?

Blowin' like a hurricane
Blowin' down the road that you left behind
I'll be on my way this time tomorrow
But know that all is free and up to you my friend

I don't care about you, I know it
If this is love then why not show it?
This is how the story goes

Blowin' like a hurricane
Blowin' down the road that you left behind
Think of me and you know it, I'm not for anyone
But love is all around and it's for everyone

I don't care about you, I know it
If this is love then why not show it?
This is how the story goes, oh
This is how the story goes, yeah



really it's true
it just took the fun out of
fundamentally bored
that's all
I rather be twosome
but then again, lonesome
isn't that bad
the part I miss the most is...
God I can't remember
what it was

I'm gonna have the time of my life
yes I am
I'm gonna have the time of my life
if I can

all the time I wasted on you
what was it for
this time I'll watch my back
don't expect me to call
I always knew that you were
a two-timing whore
and as much as I liked the making out
your mom does it better

I'm gonna have the time of my life
yes I am
I'll build a shrine the size of a life
if I can
I'm gonna stretch myself into the light
if it's there
way out way out
away from your life
that I swear



How many times will it take me to see.
I am so dangerous.
I am so irresponsible.
Here I am, broken again, but then you show me,
you're wearing the scars that save.
How can you see me, as something so lovely.
Cause it's killing me that you took the blame.
Over and over it falls back to me.
My knees hit the floor and it's easy to see.
I am so arrogant.
I feel so unforgivable.
This is my same old song.
The one where I do it all wrong.
And I will try fight with all that I am to get it right in the end.



Now your ass is on the line. 
Who do you think you're foolin' 
We ain't got the time.
Don't try to tell me, 
Who's wrong or right.
Don't say that I 
There's no point in tryin' to change it at all.

Tonight, tonight, 
Let's leave it alone, 
Leave it alone tonight, 
We can't change it at all.
Forget the things I told you, 
Let's just sleep on it for now.
It's your misunderstanding,
I don't wanna hear you out.

Two wrongs baby,
They don't make a right.
It's hardly worth the heartache,
Let's leave it alone, leave it alone.



The dogs of money all at his heel
Magicians cry "Oh truth! Oh real!"
We're all working for the Pharaoh

A thousand eyes, a thousand ears
He feeds us all, he feeds our fears
Don't stir in your sleep tonight, my dears
We're all working for the Pharaoh

It's Egypt land, Egypt land
We're all living in Egypt land
Tell me, brother, don't you understand
We're all working for the Pharaoh

Hidden from the eye of chance
The men of shadow dance a dance
We're all struck into a trance
We're all working for the Pharaoh

The idols rise into the sky
Pyramids soar, Sphinxes lie
Head of dog, Osiris eye
We're all working for the Pharaoh

And it's Egypt land, Egypt land
We're all living in Egypt land
Tell me, brother, don't you understand
We're all working for the Pharaoh

I dig a ditch, I shape a stone
Another battlement for his throne
Another day on earth is flown
We're all working for the Pharaoh

Call it England, you call it Spain
Egypt rules with a whip and chain
Moses free my people again
We're all working for the Pharaoh

And it's Egypt land, Egypt land
We're all living in Egypt land
Tell me, brother, don't you understand
We're all working for the Pharaoh

Pharaoh he sits in his tower of steel
Around his feet the princes kneel
Far beneath we shoulder the wheel
We're all working for the Pharaoh



You'd better mind your own affair
Picking up the pieces
Of a life that shone in tatters
You're gonna come back if you dare

Ain't it always the way
You get just one chance
Ain't it always the way
Ain't it always the way

You'd better learn to mind your business
Watch out for your own
Sail your boat on placid bays
You'd better learn to keep the big ship
On the straight and narrow
Let the first mate cast away


And then along comes the day
And then along comes the day

Be a winner
A dead ringer for the truth
Will the circle be unbroken
Be a master of your destiny
This is not a joke


Always the way.



Now I know
You've woke up to find
You were wrong
There ain't no doubt
Put me out
Nearly made me blind

You sent me a letter, brought tears to my eyes
Tell me you've changed, after all this time
Like a stone rolling down the mountainside
It's over, you can't turn the tide, and it's...

Tears falling about love, falling without love
Tears falling about love, falling without love

I was glad
To be with you
Near to you
My heart can't deny
I was sad
To leave your side
Stripped of pride
When you said goodbye
For every new road there must be a friend
For every broken heart there must be a mend
And the rain only lasted so long
It's over, the thing we had is gone, and it's...

Tears falling about love, falling without love
Tears falling about love, falling without love

To tell me you've changed brought tears to my eyes
Say you've rearranged after all this time
Like a stone rolling down the mountainside
It's over, you can't turn the tide, and it's...

Tears falling about love, falling without love
Tears falling about love, falling without love

Tears falling about love, falling without love
Tears falling about love, falling without love



On the beaten path from me to you

Just coz I'm leaving,
It don't make a difference
I call you at home on the day
You start to listen
We won't turn it round again
Coz I'm only losing ground

Can you feel me touching you?
I'm further and further away
Can you feel me touching you?
I'm further and further away
Can you feel me touching you?
I'm further and further away

I took my chance on a physical attraction
I photographed you in the nude
But the girl in the picture
Is a pure work of fiction
The more that I stare
The less you seem to listen
We won't turn it round again
Coz I'm only losing ground

Can you feel me touching you?
I'm further and further away
Can you feel me touching you?
I'm further and further away
Can you feel me touching you?
I'm further and further away
Coz I'm only losing ground



Is it really such a big deal?
It just seems like the right situation
To say how I really feel

I love the way that you look at me
And I can't stop looking at you
And the sweetest thing that you do for me-
Is all the little things that you do

And when the world don't feel like turning
And the sun just wants to hide
All the stars come out to remind me
Of the universe by my side

All that happens is Happiness
Happiness- when I'm with you

We ain't got a whole lot of money...
How about a five star Happy Meal?
Every day with you is just like a party
There's nothing left of me for you to steal

And when the winter wind is blowin'
I feel you blowin' kisses in my ear
And when you think that you're just talkin'-
You know its singin' that I hear

All that happens is Happiness
Happiness- when I'm with you



Baby I need, all the same things you need.

When it comes to lovin' you, I can relate.
We're two of a kind. I know how you operate.
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual, my ritual baby.

I love, all the same things you love.
Baby I long for, all the same things you long for. Every night!

When it comes to lovin' you, I can relate.
We're two of a kind, honey I know how you operate.
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual, my ritual.
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual.

Every night I worship the love we got. There's a bond between us.
Every night, I pray to the gods of love..

There's a certain passion, that covers us at night.
It's more than one desire. It's a bond that keeps us tight.
Images of love, burning in my soul.
You are my ritual. I can't let go.

When it comes to lovin' you, I can relate.
We want the same things. I don't care if you make me wait.
We're two of a kind, honey I know how you operate..
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual, my ritual
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual, my ritual...



I'm here with no-one else
I feel I've come apart.
You've seen what's in my heart

I get so bored, make your move
Won't waste away for you
Don't bring me down
We're the same, I am crying out loud too


I'm feeling all your pain
You know I feel the same
You really shouldn't question me
You are never satisfied
It's fucking me inside
You really shouldn't question me

It's true it's all because of you
We're all so lost
You sleep to rest your head
But me, I sleep... to dream

Break



How many can you swallow? 
How high do I have to fly 
To reach your nest?

In the wintertime, they disappear too soon 
And in the summertime, well I'll always be true

I need another, don't you want one too? 
'Cos I want a lover, just like I need you 
'Cos I want another

How many can I love? 
How many can I go with? 
All my love is emptiness 
When you're not around

So when the stranger comes she loves me only 
But it's never real 
It's just the wintertime you disappear 
So cold is how I feel

I need another, don't you want one too? 
'Cos I want a lover, just like I need you 
'Cos I want another

The morning came and the birds sang the song all fresh and blue 
Sadness flows for the girl that I left 
I came fumbling for you 
Looking for you

In the summertime, I'll always be true 
I need another, don't you want one too? 
'Cos I want a lover, just like I need you 
'Cos I need another, just like I need you 
'Cos I want a lover, don't you want one too? 
'Cos I need another, don't you want one too? 
'Cos I want a lover, just like I need you



On our emerald ship we sail away
The ocean holds a thousand tales untold
With this love
It's easy come and easy go
Just like the way we were
Before the fall
  
I don't see the reason why
Every angel must fly
I'm betrayed by the tear in my eye
In my eye...
  
Hey angel
Don't be afraid to earth your heart
When I see love descending like a dove
Confusion... the song you hear the blackbird sing
You fly to the sun
And you're going to burn your wings
  
I don't see the reason why
Every angel must fly
I'm betrayed by the tear in my eye
In my eye...
Well, I know every angel must fly

You're flying too high
You're flying too high
Just see the reason why
The angel must fly
No more tears in my eye
We can live in the sky
High, high, high, high



Let's forget you didn't show, not in my time
But in our sons' and daughters' time, when you get the feeling
Call and you got a room, meantime

We're cutting our hands at the kebab shop in the streets of fear
Forgetting all our best tai-kwon-do moves on a barrel of beer
We're trying to get a signal out of ragga FM, do the DTI, buzz CNN
Sucking the wine right out of the vine, spitting it out again

Groovin', lets cut out of the scene, go groovin'
Groovin', lets cut out of the scene, go groovin'
Drive, drive
Distance no object, rastafari

Yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
Yalla, yalla, yalla yo
Yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
Jambalaya on the bayou

Kool Moe Dee was in The Treacherous Three
There's old school, new school, and Brownie McGee
Going underwater to explode
Now night is falling on the grove

You can but dream...

And I hear yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
Yalla, yalla, yalla yo
Yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
Jambalaya on the bayou

Yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
Yalla, yalla, yalla yo
Yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
There's jambalaya on the bayou tonight in the grove

Well, so long, liberty
Just let's forget you never showed, not in my time
But in our sons' and daughters' time, when you get the feeling
Call and you got a room, meantime

We're cutting our hands on the kebab shop in the streets of fear
Forgetting all our best tai-kwon-do moves on a barrel of beer
Trying to get a signal through from ragga FM, do the DTI, buzz CNN
Sucking the swine right out of the vine, I'm spitting it back again

Groovin', lets cut out of the scene, go groovin'
Groovin', lets cut out of the scene, go groovin'
Drive, drive
Distance no object, rastafari

Somebody got a vision of a homeland
From a township, from a township window
Through a township window, some crazy widow
Dares to have a vision, starts seething like

Seeming like a homeland on the plain
Not in focus yet
Seeming like a homeland on the plain
Not in focus yet

I'm groovin' with a free style nation
And maximum density

And I say yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
Yalla, yalla, yalla yo
Yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
Jambalaya on the bayou

Yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
Yalla, yalla, yalla yo
Yalla, yalla, yalla, yalla
Only to shine, shine in gold, shine



Playin' in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your kind all over the place

Singin' 
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world some day
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

We will, we will rock you 
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace some day
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

We will, we will rock you
Sing it!
Hmm, we will, we will rock you
Everybody, we will, we will rock you 
Uh, we will, we will rock you 
Alright



I know you knew
That nobody cuts me
Quite like you do

And I’m going to crawl
Not that it matters
Nobody bleeds the way I do

Wherever you've gone
I can follow
The path of destruction
You leave like crumbs

And I’m going to crawl
I'm going to scratch and claw
Though I am broken, I still bleed
Whoever said?
No wind, no rain, no conversation
Can bring me back alive

I got it bad and I won't sleep
Until I breathe the sweet perfume you love

You're going to crawl, my precious
I'm untethered
Waving in the wind like feathers
Feel you near me, disappearing
If you take, you better kill me
Break me, steal me
If you don't kill me
I'm going to crawl till you crawl
Crawl like them all, my precious
I'm untethered
Waving in the wind like feathers
Crawl, my love
Crawl



Well then I'll sail this ship alone 
And if, if you decide to give him another try 
Well then I'll sail this ship alone 

Well they said if I wrote the perfect love song 
You would take me back 
Well I wrote it but I lost it 
And now will you take me back anyway 

Now if, if you insist that this is for the best 
Well then I'll sail this ship alone 
And if, if you swear that you no longer care 
Well then I'll sail this ship alone 

I'll sail this ship alone 
Between the pain and the pleasure 
I'll sail this ship alone 
Amongst the sharks and the treasure 
If you would rather go your way then go your way 
I'll sail this ship alone 

If, if you're afraid that I won't make the grade 
Well then I'll sail this ship alone 
And if, if you agree to him instead of me 
Well then I'll sail this ship alone 

Well they said if I wrote the perfect letter 
That I would have a chance 
Well I wrote it, and you burnt it 
And now do I have a chance anyway 

If, if you swear that you no longer care 
Well then I'll sail this ship alone 

I'll sail this ship alone 
Between the pain and the pleasure 
I'll sail this ship alone 
Amongst the sharks and the treasure 
If you would rather go your way then go your way 
I'll sail this ship alone 

Well they said if I burnt myself alive 
That you'd come running back



Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across

The street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture
In the name of my, in the name of my

Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man

Like autumn leaves
His sense fell from him
An empty glass of himself
Shattered somewhere within

His thoughts like a hundred moths
Trapped in a lampshade
Somewhere within

Their wings banging and burning
On through endless nights
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving
Praying for someone to turn off the light

Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man

My fears hunt me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across

The street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture
In the name of my, in the name of my

Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man

Come on



I want to tell you what it was like
My recollection is not too clear
So much hope and so much fear.

Long conversations into the night
Not like that, oh no, not so black and white
The great temptation's to try and please you
Play with you thought and mind and tease you
If I could tell my story in a song
I'd have to make it fast, yes it's very long
Many shades of grey between the right and wrong.

Day for night, night for day
All the stories on this way,
Feel the fire burn away.

So turn the lights down low, come over here
Stay with me, don't go, you'll see my characters appear
The storyteller's magic doesn't lie
He'll make you laugh to make you cry
Real for me is real for you
What I say is almost true.

Day for night, night for day
All the stories on its way,
Feel the fire burn and play.

The story's ended now you're on your own
Let's say a little prayer, go home.



Polluting this land
I'm a middle-class kiddie
But I know where I stand
We got brothers in Brixton
Backs to the wall
Bigots on the backlash
Divided we fall
 
But we ain't gonna take it
Ain't gonna take it
They're keeping us under
But we ain't gonna take it no more
 
Women with children
Have to carry the can
Till they lose them in divorce courts
To some pig of a man
We got Benyon and Whitehouse
Trying to get us stitched
'Cause abortion and a gay scene
Only meant for the rich
 
But we ain't gonna take it
Ain't gonna take it
They're keeping us under
But we ain't gonna take it no more
 
Sisters and brothers
What have we done
We're fighting each other
Instead of the Front
Better get it together
Big trouble to come
And the odds are against us
About twenty to one
 
But we ain't gonna take it
Ain't gonna take it
They're keeping us under
But we ain't gonna take it no more



Now, how can I see? I take a Polaroid from there; at the close of the day
It's an endless time. Yes, I swear
This is creepy fun in our ghost town
We take a walk on an empty street
We scream for ice cream. Despite my daydreams
I got wicked fashion sense, I don't miss their summer trance
I could stroll for miles and miles
Moonbathing under trees
In the mood to leave my town, I take a ride
I don't need no nicotine when I long for you, tonight
And please don't care if they say I'm off the rail
I could loose my way if you want my love
Lights are turning blue and smile
Is blooming like there is no more time
We'll be strong. No break before the dawn
Wishing well of ghosts
It's all about to be
I don't sympathize, I won't realize
I will be here, outside
In the mood to leave my town, I take a ride
I don't need no nicotine when I long for you, tonight
And please don't care if they say I'm off the rail
I could loose my way if you want my love

I'm quite scared of the German pope
But I don't miss my summer love
I could stroll for your eyes
When I long for you tonight
I got wicked common sense
I don't miss your lonely dance
I'll be strong wishing well of ghosts



Looka yonder! A big black cloud come!
A big black cloud come!
O comes to Tupelo. Comes to Tupelo

Yonder on the horizon
Yonder on the horizon
Stopped at the mighty river
Stopped at the mighty river and
Sucked the damn thing dry
Tupelo-o-o, O Tupelo
In a valley hides a town called Tupelo

Distant thunder rumble. Distant thunder rumble
Rumble hungry like the Beast
The Beast it cometh, cometh down
The Beast it cometh, cometh down
Wo wo wo-o-o
Tupelo bound. Tupelo-o-o. Yeah Tupelo
The Beast it cometh, Tupelo bound

Why the hen won't lay no egg
Can't get that cock to crow
The nag is spooked and crazy
O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!
O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!

Ya can say these streets are rivers
Ya can call these rivers streets
Ya can tell ya self ya dreaming buddy
But no sleep runs this deep
No! No sleep runs this deep
No sleep runs this deep
Women at their windows
Rain crashing on the pane
Writing in the frost
Tupelos' shame. Tupelo's shame
O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!

O go to sleep lil children
The sandmans on his way
O go to sleep lil children
The sandmans in his way
But the lil children know
They listen to the beating of their blood
Listen to the beating of their blood
Listen to the beating of their blood
Listen to the beating of their blood
They listen to the beating of their blood
The sandman's mud!
The sandman's mud!
And the black rain come down
The black rain come down
The black rain come down
Water water everywhere
Where no bird can fly no fish can swim
Where no bird can fly no fish can swim
No fish can swim
Until The King is born!
Until The King is born!
In Tupelo! Tupelo-o-o!
Til The King is born in Tupelo!

In a clap-board shack with a roof of tin
Where the rain came down and leaked within
A young mother frozen on a concrete floor
With a bottle and a box and a cradle of straw
Tupelo-o-o! O Tupelo!
With a bottle and a box and a cradle of straw

Well Saturday gives what Sunday steals
And a child is born on his brothers heels
Come Sunday morn the first-born dead
In a shoebox tied with a ribbon of red
Tupelo-o-o! Hey Tupelo!
In a shoebox buried with a ribbon of red

O ma-ma rock you lil' one slow
O ma-ma rock your baby
O ma-ma rock your lil' one slow
O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!
Mama rock your lil' one slow
The lil one will walk on Tupelo
The lil one will walk on Tupelo
Black rain come down, Black rain come down
Tupelo-o-o! Yeah Tupelo!
And carry the burden of Tupelo
Tupelo-o-o! O Tupelo! Yeah!
The King will walk on Tupelo!
Tupelo-o-o! O Tupelo!
He carried the burden outa Tupelo!
Tupelo-o-o! Hey Tupelo!
You will reap just what you sow



In the ranks of death you'll find him;
His father's sword he hath girded on,
And his wild harp slung behind him;

"Land of Song!" cried the warrior bard,
Should "Tho' all the world betrays thee,
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,
One faithful harp shall praise thee!"

The Minstrel fell! But the foeman's chain
Could not bring that proud soul under;
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again,
For he tore its chords asunder;

And said "No chains shall sully thee,
Thou soul of love and brav'ry!
Thy songs were made for the pure and free
They shall never sound in slavery!



And no one wastes me with their words like you do
No one can change my views like you
Do

Do you really think I wanted this to fail?
Do you really think this crazy world'll get better?
Do you really think this crazy world'll get better?

No one tastes like you
And no one wastes me with their words like you do
Nothing is between us is assumed
And no one can change the fact that I was sold on you

I'm the reject that you never accepted
I'm the reject that you always neglected
I'm the reject that you never accepted
Now I'm left wrecked and forever affected

There's nothing left to do
There's nothing left to say
No more words
I miss all the things you do
There's no 
Excuse

Do you really think I wanted this to fail?
Do you really think this crazy world'll get better?
Do you really think this crazy world will get better?

I'm the reject that you never accepted
I'm the reject that you always neglected
I'm the reject that you never accepted
I'm the reject that you always neglected
Now I'm left wrecked and forever affected

You know when I'm all alone
There's nothing else I can say
There's no one else I can pay anymore



When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born - oooooh
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru... now!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I wake up
Feel just fine
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cause you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see?
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah

Breakthru, these barriers of pain
Breakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru
Now! now now now
Oh yeah

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me
I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh yeah
Breakthru, breakthru

Break, hey
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Breakthru



tell me what can I do to change your mind 



And felt the loneliness of what you can't explain?
Have you had your death today
And resurrected joy from the jaws of pain?

As a dark angelcalls my name
I won't answer loneliness
Arid landscapes call for me to be the desert cancer

Have you had your resurrection
And seen old opinions formed swept away?
Have you had you soul baptism on a ragged flame
And felt the loss of shame and seen the world had changed?

As a dark angel calls my name
I won't answer loneliness
Arid landscapes call for me to be the desert cancer
As a dark angel calls my name
I won't answer loneliness
Arid landscapes call for me to be the desert cancer

Have you had your death today
And crossed the line in the sand?
You know the middle ground is wasted land

As a dark angel calls my name
The state of my soul is my concern surrender
You see the more I sparkle the less I burn
Sacrifice as a dark angel calls my name
I won't answer loneliness
Arid landscapes call for me to be the desert cancer

If I were a little less stupid
And a little less greedy
Maybe I wouldn't be so needy
But there's always faith and hope

The dark angel calls my name

But I won't answer
I WON'T ANSWER!



you'll look for me and baby I'll be long gone
I'll be down the road
You'll look for me,
but me you won't see

Yeah, one of these days, you know the time is near,
you'll look for me, but baby I won't be here
I'm gonna be long gone
You'll look for me,
but me you won't see

Yeah, one of these days, you're gonna wake up and find,
this lonesome boy has changed his cotton-picking mind
He's gonna be long gone
You'll look for he,
but he you won't see
Long gone!
Long gone!
Long gone!
Long gone!

You'll look for me, and me you won't see



To say I'm living on my own
Girls
I need someone to love
I need someone
Girls
It's true I've been telling you all these lies
And I can't understand it
Why I've been telling thee all these lies
If you know it's a fact
Then you know I want you back
Girls

I need someone it's true, I need you
Girls
It's true for me there's you
Girls
Got class, I need her fast
Girls
She's been telling me all these lies
And I can't understand it
She's been telling me all these lies
That girl don't love me no more
Oh girl

I had to write this letter
To tell you how I came to meet him
He was sweet and I loved him
Now each time we meet I can't seem to forget him
I feel so depressed

Lost love of Romeo
Casanova has finally lost out on love
I'm jealous of his past

Oh won't you send a letter home
Say I'm living on my own
Girls
I need someone to love
I need someone to love
Girls
With class, that's fast
Don't move slow
Girls
Oh no not alone oh no
Girls
For me
I've been telling you all these lies
And I can't understand it
I've been telling you all these lies
I must have been crazy
Girl
Oh girl

My dream any sadness, sorrow or gloom
Your laugh that fills the air
With the scent of the sweetest perfume

You feel so good
You just don't care
I lay awake night crying
Because my dream may not come true
You see I love you
Please this is my one and only dream

Girls
Girls
Who's fast, she's got class, she loves last
Girls
She's not slow
She won't go
She won't leave you, alone
Girls
Don't leave me alone



There were no one there just an empty lane.
I was dreaming, dreaming.
I turned around like I never cared
Cause I'm proud enough, and I ain't scared.
I'm not lying, lying.

As the night comes along
I just have to be strong
I can make it alone.

So tell me why do I bleed this way.
So tell me why my life has gone astray.
Oh tell me why there's no turning back.
Nothing left to say at the end of the day.

Today I saw you with another man
As you walked along hand in hand.
I'm not crying, crying.
I'm moving on with my head held high
No one touches me, I can almost fly.
I ain't lying, I ain't lying.

As the night comes along
I just have to be strong
I can make it alone.

So tell me why do I bleed this way.
So tell me why my life has gone astray.
Oh tell me why there's no turning back.
Nothing left to say at the end of the day.

I thought I saw you on the street today
There were no one there, just and empty lane.
I was dreaming, dreaming.

So tell me why.
So tell me why my life has gone astray.
Oh tell me why there's no turning back.
Nothing left to say at the end of the day.

I ain't crying, crying, crying over you.
I ain't crying, crying, crying over you.
There's nothing left to.
There is nothing left to say.
At the end of the day.
There's nothing left to.
There is nothing left to say.
At the end of the day.



It seems that even if I had, I'd rather itch than not
When the pleasure is the lesser and it's giving to the pressure
Of an ever growing lust and an always present want

All this is yours so here's your piece of it, your part in it
Clench your jaws with claws, you'll strangle it, you'll smother it
Damn right, I want nothing to do with this, no part of it

Fight to death to keep it
This mere fondling is mine
It's the subtlest of snares
I've cared so much with proving that I've lost all love for proof
An ever growing craving for a quickly fading feel
It's the subtlest of snares
I'd trade my soul for a great big hole and a heart too hard to heal

All this is yours so here's your piece of it, your part in it
Clench your jaws with claws, you'll strangle it, you'll smother it
Damn right, I want nothing to do with this, no part of it
Keep locked your jaws I hope you choke on it, choke on it

The craving grows
Fiercer and fiercer it grows
It grows
The craving grows
Fiercer and fiercer it grows
It grows

My heart is ringing out of tune
Fiercer and fiercer it grows
My heart is ringing out of tune
Fiercer and fiercer it grows
My heart is calling out for you

I'm first to thirst and the last to drink
Of the words I've heard but rarely think
Forget my heart has gone to hell
I have found the well and it's mine, all mine

I've got this little itch that I never learned to scratch
It seems that even if I had, I'd rather itch than not
When the pleasure is the lesser and it's giving to the pressure
Of an ever growing lust and an always present want


All this is yours so here's your piece of it, your part in it
Clench your jaws with claws, you'll strangle it, you'll smother it
Damn right, I want nothing to do with this no part of it
Keep locked your jaws I hope you choke on it, choke on it



Smog's been beaten down for awhile 
Drove up a hill where I could feel the ocean... 
And see for miles 
Feels like the top of the world 
Right here the world's all mine 

Here i lie watching the cars on the highway 
You're one of those lights that's driving away 
I'm standing in the dark wondering where you are 
I'm leaving my heart here in Echo Park. 

Today you said you were leaving, 
Couldn't let you see me cry 
You can take what you want to 
But won't let you take my pride 
Feels like the top of the world 
Right here the world's all mine 

Here i lie watching the cars on the highway 
You're one of those lights that's driving away 
I'm standing in the dark wondering where you are 
I'm leaving my heart here in Echo Park. 

And the cars look smaller from here 
And the sky looks bigger from here 
And now that everything is clear 
Everything falls apart... 

Here i lie watching the cars on the highway 
You're one of those lights that's driving away 
I'm standing in the dark wondering where you are... 
Wondering where you are... in Echo Park, in Echo Park!



Tryin' to find the scene where you believed me
I been true, I been waiting here for you
I been patient, understanding and believing

Every time you turn around

I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down
I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down every time you turn around

I been good, I been doin' what I should
Workin' hard to make a world that we can live in
I been strong, I been holding out so long
And don't you forget that you're forgiven 

I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down
I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down every time you turn around

All the reasons you believe what you believe
Never seeing that the truth is a part of me
What all I wanna do is show you what it really means to love
What it really means to love

I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down
I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down every time you turn around



The sun betrayed a tarnished glow
A smoke come down, erase our eyes
The sky's too low to recognize

All the while the rainbow serpent winds
As her children faintly lost their minds

Can't be TV, the buried crime
A perfect world, a plan sublime
Watch your neighbor, buy your face
Keeping time, but losing place

All the while the rainbow serpent crawls
While her children dream of wails and walls

In the veins of belief, or the diamonds of our eye, she lingers there

Big deal, debrief, a heart of chrome
Running scared as the lizards roam
The rabbit hole seems far away
But the dream of age is here to stay

All the while the rainbow serpent smiles
Watching all her children's final mile

All the while the rainbow serpent smiles
Watching all her children's final mile



The last time that I've seen her
The highway's still cold and wet and I can't forget
The way I had to leave her
And every passing day, she flickers as she fades
Is someone to catch her when she falls from the heavens?

And I'll love her yet, though she has done me wrong
Can I bring her back, though she has been long gone?
And I'll always be her
Broken hearted savior

And every heavy night
Takes out the little life that's left within her
Every man, she gives her love, he takes it
And leaves her with a dinner
Our love was once a flame, now I'm just a forgotten name
Am I the only one to blame for ever loving her?

And I'll love her yet, though she has done me wrong
And I'll bring her back, though she has been long gone
And I'll always be her
Broken hearted savior, yeah no no no no



Searchin' searchin'
searchin' oh, I'm searchin'
searchin' searchin'.

Tell me again why I'm alone,
am I too choosy or is a good man hard to find,
I believe there's someone for each of us,
so I've got to be, at the right place, at the right time,
In my black pumps,
I check the mirror,
although I see myself clearly, it's you I can't find,
so I'm left just...

Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'

Once I thought I found my dream come true,
I woke up and found it wasn't you,
who are you ? The one, soul mate, my knight in armor,
In your face the sun will rise and set,
the Yin to my Yang, the upside in a downward trend,
yes, I'll know you when I find you,
Until then...

I'm searchin with no end, for my lover and friend,
and with you I will rest and truly find my piece,
Of heaven here on earth, and deep within my heart,
you are the missing part so I'll just keep on...

Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'

My tears reflect the pain burried in my heart from past loves,
Look me in my eyes, you'll see the need, not the fear to be enough,
tell me why do I expose my feelings, only to feel the pain again,
so I run and I run,
how far can I run from the me I find inside of you,
Protection is my prison, defenses keep me bound in my stone heart,
if I conceal myself will I ever love again ?
all I need is my superman,
show me the place I can run and don't have to hide,
Somebody help me,
I want to feel love, without pain.

I'm searchin with no end, for my lover and friend,
and with you I will rest and truly find my piece,
Of heaven here on earth, and deep within my heart,
you are the missing part so I'll just keep on...
I'll keep on... searchin'.

Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'

So I'll keep on searchin' baby, until I find you,
I'm gonna keep searchin' baby, oh, searchin' searchin'.
So I'll keep searchin' baby, until I find you,
I'm gonna keep searchin' baby, searchin'.

Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
searchin' searchin' so I'll keep searchin' baby.

Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'
Searchin' searchin'

Searchin' so I'll keep on searchin' baby,
searchin' until I find you,
searchin' I'm gonna keep searchin' baby,
searchin' I'm searchin' searchin',
searchin' so I'll keep searchin' baby,
searchin' until I find you,
searchin' I'm gonna keep searchin' baby,
searchin' searchin'.

Searchin' searchin' I'm searchin',
searchin' searchin' oooh,
searchin' searchin' searchin' searchin',
searchin' searchin' hey, hey.



It's all too much

When I look into your eyes
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside
The more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time
Of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are 
Or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Sail me on a silver sun
For I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere
And get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much
It's too much

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much

Too much too much too much



And let's fall in love
You are beautiful to me
Wet your lips and let's do a thing
With a view to make your spirit sing
I have come to be your man
In a strange and hostile land
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love
And stay with me

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
You are blood and wine to me
Wet you lips
And let's do a turn
With a view to make your body burn
I'll rebuild the scenery
Into garden greenery
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love
And stay with me

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
You're the molecular soul of me
Wet your lips
And let's dip your wings
Into shapes of many things
I have come to bring new life
And to help you squeeze it from your slice
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love
And stay with me

I will feed you like a bird
From the mouth of my dying words
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
Stay.....

Girl you take me higher
Yeah you take me deeper
Girl you take me higher



I'm gonna get away with it
I'm gonna get the one from the break in the coffee shop
I'm gonna get away with it

And they won't know just what it was that hit them
And they will try and try and try and try

I'm gonna get the one that fucks them all
I'm gonna get away with it
I'm gonna get the one they've only read about
I'm gonna get away with it

And they won't know just what it was that hit them
And they will try and try and try



i find i'm made of dust again
look away from evil desplays
shadows on your walls come from my eyes

if i could only be, if i could only be your master
you'll torture me until the die i die to you
if i could only learn to ignore myself and let you burn away,
save myself from your decay
leave me every time i'm up you come to hold me down, hold me
i see i've got nothing left to show you now show you
want to decide to commit willicide
i chew the chains i wrapped again
in my dream see what i've seen
the sun will dry you up and burn the dead away



Much colder than I thought even in the month of June
No communication makes ya feel so alone
All we need is patience in which I've never really known

But now it's too late, it's taking over me
It feels so supernatural and I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take and I'm losing hold of everything
And no matter how I try you know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural

Every step I've taken has led me here to where you are
But all that I believe in is keeping me from seeing too far
Throwing out the questions, waiting for the right reply
Looking for the answerrs, tell me will it be tonight?

But now it's too late, it's taking over me
It feels so supernatural and I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take and I'm losing hold of everything
When it's more than physical it's kind of hard to see beyond the glow
And no matter how I try you know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural

Through the atmosphere I'm seeing
Glimpses of the past I'm leaving
Holding on for life as we collide

But now it's too late, it's taking over me
It feels so supernatural and I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take and I'm losing hold of everything
When it's more than physical it's kind of hard to see beyond the glow
And no matter how I try you know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural



Of California red,
We'll drink it on a Tuesday,
Let it go straight to our heads.

And we'll eat from good china,
And make love on linen sheets,
Just like there's no tomorrow,
No surrender, no retreat - Yeah.

I can feel it in my bones,
And I know it in my heart,
Tomorrow may be rainin', but tonight we have the stars,
We may always be together,
Or miles and miles apart,
Tomorrow may be rainin', but tonight we have the stars - Yeah.

We were young and we were foolish,
We were easy to deceive,
Said we'd be in love forever,
And it was easy to believe.

Well you and I we had our moments,
Our devils and our doubts,
But the time we spend together - Yeah,
We gotta make it count.

I can feel it in my bones,
And I know it in my heart,
Tomorrow may be rainin', but tonight we have the stars - Yeah,
We may always be together,
Or miles and miles apart,
Tomorrow may be rainin', but tonight we have the stars - Yeah.

So let's hold on to this moment,
'cause it's all we've really got - Yeah!

I can feel it in my bones,
And I know it in my heart,
Tomorrow may be rainin', but tonight we have the stars,
We may always be together,
Or miles and miles apart,
Tomorrow may be rainin', but tonight we have the stars - Yeah.

I can feel it in my bones,
And I know it in my heart,
Tomorrow may be rainin', but tonight we have the starts - Yeah.

Oh yeah, tonight we have the stars.



What happened to my perfect world
Front page news she's already gone
Say hello to the goodbye girl
LA traffic don't make it better
I wonder if she read my letter
9 to 5 keep it all alive
Some days are hard to survive
I feel so down about it

I don't wanna be alone
Just waitin' by the phone
I can't stand another night on my own
With a new day risin', realizin'
That you gotta be free break it down to you and me
Is it everything you want it to be
I wanted you all along
So where did we go wrong?

Never had a lot of money but we 
Spent a good time in the city
Drinkin' wine and watching the telly
Old movies she sure looked pretty
This kitchen feels so alone
Haven't cleaned since she's been gone
Spend my nights at your favorite bar
And I wonder just where you are
I feel so down about it

I don't wanna be alone
Just waitin' by the phone
I can't stand another night on my own
With a new day risin', realizin'
That you gotta be free break it down to you and me
Is it everything you want it to be
I wanted you all along
So where did we go wrong?

I don't wanna turn back time
I just wanna change your mind
I just want a chance to prove to you
I really wanna chase these clouds away clouds away
Save them for a rainy day
There's nothin' left to say

I don't wanna be alone
Just waitin' by the phone
I can't stand another night on my own
With a new day risin', realizin'
That you gotta be free break it down to you and me
Is it everything you want it to be
I wanted you all along
So where did we go wrong?

I wanted you all along
So where did we go wrong?

But I went on and left her 'fore I'd made a start 
Now I'm moaning the blues like the rest of the charts 
Take me back 

So I'll cry with a limp 
Just get by on a limb 
Till these blue eyes of mine they are closed 
So here's to an old fashioned peck on the cheek 
And farewell my sweet Northern Rose 

Give me one last love song 
To bring you back, bring you back 
Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black 
Give him a chorus and that bit at the end 
Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend 
Let him scream loudly 'well this love could mend' 
Let it die, let it die 

Those bloody great ballads we hated at first 
Well I bought them all, now I'm writing worse 
Save us from baldness and saving the earth 
Take me back 

And I'll smile with a limp 
And I'll love with a limp 
Till the clouds disappear from above 
And as the storm moves away all I can say 
Is there's a towel on the door for your love 

Give me one last love song 
To bring you back, bring you back 
Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black 
Give him a chorus and that bit at the end 
Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend 
Let him scream loudly 'well this love could mend' 
Let it die, let it die, let it die



I feel too small
Something's gotta burn
Sick on you
Drunken highways
Someone take the wheel 

Faded in the blackout you left me in
It's safer on the outside
I'm swimming in
This kerosene it's hard to breathe
The statics got me down 

I can't sleep
I'm disconnected
Everything went wrong
And certain stars
Are sad and bruised like
Someone's cheating heart

Faded in the blackout you left me in
It's safer on the outside
I'm swimming in
This kerosene it's hard to breathe
The statics got me down

Faded in the blackout you left me in
It's safer on the outside
I'm swimming in
This kerosene it's hard to breathe
The statics got me down

Faded in the blackout you left me in Faded in the blackout you left me in
It's safer on the outside It's safer on the outside
I'm swimming in It's hard to breathe
This kerosene it's hard to breathe It's hard to breathe
The statics got me down Ya got me down

Ya got me down, ya got me down, ya got me down
You're safer on the outside
You're safer on the outside
You're safer on the outside



Kevin has a caterpillar squeezed between his fingers
Hear the mailman come, see what he delivers

And you wait
And it makes you feel strange
As if you were afraid
And you lie

With a look to the side
And you say
I was addicted to the drug
But now I know when I've had enough

Could curl up and sleep on the floor
But I'm riding the train a hunder miles an hour
It feels like this train might never stop

Watching static on the television
When the morning comes
And you wait
And it makes you feel strange
As if you are deranged

With a look to the side
And you say
I was addicted to the drug
But now I know when I've had enough

So far, you've come so far
You've come so far
We've come so far



Gideon makes love to the suites
Holly's not invincible, in fact she's in the hospital
Not far from that bar where we met on that first night

Charlemagne pulls street corner scams
Gideon's got a pipe made from a Pringles can
Holly's insatiable, she still looks incredible
But she don't look like the same girl we met

On that first night
She was golden with bar light and beer
On that first night
She slept like she'd never been scared

And then last night
She said, 
And then last night
She cried and she told us about Jesus

Holly's inconsolable
Unhinged and uncontrollable
'Cause we can't get as high as we got
On that first night

Boys and girls in America
Boys and girls in America
Boys and girls in America
Boys and girls in America
Boys and girls in America

Don't bother talking to the guys with the hot, soft eyes
You know they're already taken
Don't even speak to all those sequencer and beats boys
When they kiss they spit white noise

When they kiss they spit white noise
When they kiss they spit white noise
When they kiss they spit white noise
When they kiss they spit white noise

Yeah, when they kiss they spit white noise
Yeah, when they kiss they spit white noise
When they kiss they spit white noise



But you know that they'll stay
Southtown girls won't blow you away
But you know that they'll stay

Southtown girls won't blow you away
But you know that they'll stay
Southtown girls won't blow you away
But you know that they'll stay

Take Lyndale to the horizon
Take Nicollet out to the ocean
Take Penn Ave out to the 494
And meet me right in front of the fabric store

Don't look me in the eye, look over at the theater
I'm a little bit surprised, you didn't tell me there'd be three of you
Hey Bloomington, what'd you let them do to you?
Now I think they're almost through with you

Southtown girls won't blow you away
But you know that they'll stay
Southtown girls won't blow you away
But you know that they'll stay

Take Lyndale back to the southside
Take Nicollet up to the Vietnamese
Take Penn Ave back up to the northside
Take Lowery East to the quarry

Meet me right in front of the Rainbow Foods, I got a brown paper bag and black buckle shoes
And if anything seems weird then just cruise
Meet me right in front of the Party City, that two-sided tape it gets way too sticky
I got a bad case of noisemaker blues

Southtown girls won't blow you away
But you know that they'll stay
Southtown girls won't blow you away
But you know that they'll stay

Southtown girls won't blow you away
But you know that they'll stay
Southtown girls won't blow you away
But you know that they'll stay



Simple words
But words which had never been heard
By the soul
Stoned to death
But still living
And so he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried

Ride our minds
If you must
But there's always a line you don't cross
Time is short
Don't be cruel
Oh you don't know the power
In what you're saying
Oh ...
And so he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried


People where
I come from
They survive without feelings or blood
I never could
Was stoned to death
But I'm still living
So he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried

So he froze
And he looked, and he looked
To the ground
And he cried
He cried



she's a thousand Florence Nightingales all rolled up into one
and well people take advantage but she loves her fellow friend
with a slow, slow count from ten... 
when strangers die around her she still cries herself to sleep
and she seldom gets the chance to pick the company she keeps
and the ring around her finger is a ring around her past
and a youth that couldn't last 

when people ask if she's OK she doesn't even answer
her mind is set on auto-think, for heaven knows how long
with the body of an angel and the features of a child 


she's miles and miles and miles and miles away
she's the miles away girl, 'cos she's the miles away girl
and she slaps miles and miles of smiles on every face
she's the miles away girl, she's the miles away girl
she's the miles away girl, right next to me 


she send a men to slumber-land with just one little kiss
her silence is refreshing and her honesty is bliss
she's probably clairvoyant but she never had the call
but that's not long at all...
her head's up with the stars because she knows that's where she's heading
the good guys think she's different the rest just think she's weird
she doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep, she's thinking all the while 


and maybe you're the angel I knew that you could be
well that must be the reason you bring out the devil in me
deep under the covers, an easy place to hide
and imagine the world isn't really going on outside
but you never seem to have any money 'cos the decent people never get paid
but there's never really ever a problem' cos you can get miles away, miles away, miles away 




Time, it's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 
Smaller face to synthesize 
It's only Faith from crime to cranks 
It's only Faith belief in visions 
Here comes the faceless of the heart 

Her her tricks tricks you 
And I I need to solve these problems 

Time, it's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 

Time and speed cross the surface of their faces 
It's proof and it's blind 
That's my life is untimely 

Time, it's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 

Yeah sex it's all a question of lies 
It's all the bodies they seek 
It's all the bodies they face 
And I'm fond of peace 
I follow time 
It's full of loopholes 
It's for the meek 
It's for the strong 
It follows me 
It's for Neutron Yeah! 

Time, it's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 

Produce is sick 
And finance is my face 
Jews they are fine 
And solutions keep coming forward 

Time, it's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 

Time, it's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time 
It's all a question of time

Crescent heights the city lights the way
To another wasted day
Shiny cars and shooting stars
California dreaming in my ear
I just wish that you were here
I'm dealing with scars
Just trying to see who we are 
Nobody said it would be easy
Fighting your way through another day
I think I know how you feel
Looking for something that matters
Keeping it together when it's all been shattered
We all want something real 

Summer's on a holiday
Pills to chase the blues away
Who knows just how far this story goes
So listen to the radio
Turn it up so you can sing along
Even though the notes are wrong
I'm building up walls
And trying to break all the falls 

All your life you're wondering
We don't know what's happening
Somethings gotta give
Falling through the atmosphere
See the world in black and white
These pictures coming clear
How many times I wished that you were here



Look around around around around
Around around around around..
But you won't see me you won't see me..
Now I'm here now I'm here..
Now I'm there now I'm there..
I'm just a just a new man
Yes you made me live again

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight
Whatever came of you and me?
America's new bride to be
Don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yes she made me live again Yeah!

A thin moon me in the smoke screen sky
Where the beams of your love light chase
Don't move don't speak don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so don't I love him so?

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memories with you

Now I'm here now I'm here.
Think I'll stay around around around
Around around around around..
Down in the city just you and me
Down in the city just you and me..

Don't I love you so?

Go Go Go Little Queenie



I wear your reflection
I echo your heartbeat
In the wind

You might say we're lovers
You might say we're strangers
You think you don't know me
But you're wearing my ring

Good road, bad road
Just don't mean a thing
Good dream, bad dream
Just don't mean a thing
Down in the while of the wheels
You'll hear me sing

I'm like a TV eye in the sky but I'm right behind you
I'm like your signed confession but I'm right behind you
I'm like the child you never were but I'm right behind you
Let's ride

I ride in your slipstream
but don't try to touch me
Just trust me to love you
I love you

I ride in your slipstream
I ride in your slipstream
I ride in your slipstream



Turn the radio down, down
Vanilla Radio
Down with the music go-round
Down with the music go-round-round
Vanilla Radio

Vanilla Radio
Vanilla Radio
Remember radio?
Being lost in the audio?

I want my radio:
Where's my Elvis?

All that the kids will allow
All that the kids will allow, now
Vanilla Radio
So turn the radio down
Turn the radio down, down
Vanilla Radio
Etc



All the boys knew it was a joke about Jamaica
She'd always find a ride back home from the bar

She used to feel so stupid when they'd talk about the music
Born into every single tune
They used to hum against her lips with their hands on her hips
They used to kiss in the car

Dancing days, houses of the holy
Hot child in the city in the middle of the prairie
Flirting with the boys with all her charms

First the laugh, then the eyes
Then the touch him on the arms
Then the drinks, they never seemed to cost money
Saturday night was a runway that extended into Sunday
And sometimes Monday

Back then it was beautiful
The boys were sweet and musical
The laser lights looked mystical
Messed up still felt magical

Girls didn't seem so difficult
Boys didn't seem so typical
It was warm and white and wonderful
We were all invincible

Tired eyes, trampled under foot
Dazed and confused, c-c-c-cocaine blues
She hasn't gotten any eye contact tonight

The boys are getting younger and the bands are getting louder
And the new girls are coming up like some white unopened flowers
She's pretty sure that that's where their power is

Back then it was unified
The punks, the skins, the greaser guys
Then one summer two kids died
One of them was crucified

Now it's so competitive
The sleeplessness and sedatives
I know it sounds repetitive
Every show can't be a benefit

We were kids in the crowd, now we're dogs in this war
We were wasps with new wings, now we're bugs in the jar
We were hot soft and pure, now we're scratched up in scars
We were counting carbs, now we eat in our cars
The boys in the band, they know they'll never be stars

Back then we weren't quite convinced
Flyering and stickering
The front-row girls were posturing
We were all imagining

Man, we had some massive nights
Some bashes and some bloody fights
Back before those two kids died



Nobody spoke to her and she couldn't sleep at night
No one there knew what she had been through

If they ever make one baby we should go right ahead
Saturn freeway
Then we could reverse the violence
And go right ahead
Saturn freeway
Go right ahead

I'm just trying to cheer you up
But who am I to know
I never heard the shots they fired
Just glad they let you go

Don't feel sad now you are safe and sound
Don't be bad when it brings you down
I know a girl and she's still hiding

We could be like superman we could go right ahead
Saturn freeway
Then we could reverse the violence
Go right ahead
Saturn freeway
If they ever made one baby we should go right away
Saturn freeway



And I know the whole world's corrupt,
Some say that there's really no hope,
Some say that our time is up.

But you know
I found out
There's a small speck of human kindness,
Buried very deep in everyone.
And I've no doubts, Time's gonna change

Sometimes, I know that you say you hate me
Sometimes, I know that I say we're through
Some say, we're not right together
But I know what I have to do
Listen to me,

I found out
That there's no one else that I could ever live with,
let's forget about the past,
And I've no doubts, our love will last
reason to shout - calling your name
I found out,
Hear what I'm talking about
things gonna change
I found out.

In the grand scheme of things,
We're just tiny grands of sand
We don't mean a thing to the powers in control,
But it's time we made a stand,
And maybe then we'll reach our goal.

I know that I'm far from clever,
And I know that I don't fit in,
But don't treat me like I'm good for nothing,
Because I see my ship's coming in.

I found out,
That no matter what they say,
They can never take away my self respect.
I've no doubts,
Tide's gonna turn
I found out
Things gonna change reason to shout...



Compassion leads to many lies and trying to apply it will just drive you mad
It's only destiny calling with the usual show
Get out while you've got time, make up your heart and find the kind of folk who really love.

You want to know how to tell them apart 
You want to know how to feel in your heart 
Too bad for you that they don't do a five day course in caring you could play the part
You're still searching for the ones who were near
You're still itching for that great panacea 
But first you got to be alone and think what kept your friends contented all those years.

Something about their eyes
I thought you couid tell by now
Remote control, off and jump now
Remote control, pull out the wires
Remote control, off and jump now
Remote control, pull out the wires.

Want to know a secret, most people are that bad
Compassion leads to many lies and trying to apply it will just drive you mad
It's only destiny calling with the usual show
Get out while you've got time, make up your heart and find the kind of folk who really love.

You want to know how to tell them apart 
You want to know how to feel in your heart 
Too bad for you that they don't do a five day course in caring you could play the part
You're still searching for the ones who were near
You're still itching for that great panacea
But first you got to be alone and think what kept your friends contented all those years.

There's something I must do
I planned it all this way
Designed it just for you
Do you wanna be with me
be with me at all
Do you have to be so cool
Your gentle touch manoeuvered me
But all the time I always knew

I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love
I'm giving you the only heart I have
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough

Can we go on this way
There's nothing left to prove
It's not another game
or another simple move
Do you believe in me
believe in me at all
Are you telling me the truth
or is it just imagination
or the perfect dream
That I'm here with you

I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love
I'm giving you the only heart I have
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough

Do you wanna be with me
be with me at all
Do you have to be so cool
Your gentle touch manoeuvered me
But all the time I always knew

I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love
I'm giving you the only heart I have
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough

I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love
I've never had a broken heart before
But I know you'll never tear, tear mine apart



Now record

There's a place in the city
Just down by the river
All the rats went crazy
Got fangs made of silver
Killin' rats

They're cruisin' downtown
Their eyes full of anger
If they can't hurt you
They will find another
Killin' rats

They will shot down your father
They will spit on your mother
Rape browny girls, girls and slaughter your brother
Killin' rats, killin' rats

Record

Those rats need a scratch like that
Those rats need a scratch like that

All you real cool cats
Put yourself together
Get them back to their swamp
Before they make you surrender
Killin' rats

Old cats, they quiver
'Cause it makes them remember
About a long time ago
When they fought rat's father
Killin' rats

Was a rat called Hitler
Set the world on fire
This is no fare game
They wanna do it again
Killin' rats, killin' rats

Those rats need a scratch like that, rats
Those rats need a scratch like that, rats
Those rats need a scratch like that, rats

I need a scratch



Have you broken skin this time?
Made your mark and took me deeper
As you drown me with your eyes
I held my hand over your mouth
As you scream at me to feel
You felt my scars with understanding
But I can't promise anything

Can you tell
That I picked my poison well
That I have no more to sell to you
Is it really that important that I settle down?
Does it really even matter that I have my doubts?
I search for the one who bleeds
I reach for the one who bleeds

I forget to dream in color
I am better off alone
Honest hearts are undercover
We are shadows on our own
Lose ourselves in open waters
Always swimming back to shore
My addictions have no boundaries
Now I'm crying out for more

Can you tell
That I picked my poison well
That I have no more to sell to you
Is it really that important that I settle down
Does it really even matter that I have my doubts
I search for the one who bleeds
I reach for the one who bleeds
Like me

I have my doubts
I have my doubts
And so does everybody else
So help me take this all away
You gotta help me take this all away
Please help me take this all away
And bleed like me
So help me take this all away
You gotta help me take this all away
Please help me take this all away
And bleed like me

Is it really that important that I settle down?
Does it really even matter that I have my doubts?
I search for the one who bleeds
I reach for the one who bleeds

I reach for
I reach for
I reach for
I reach for
I reach for the one who bleeds
Like me



You know I'm not someone
Who likes to wait around in line
You know I'm not someone
Who likes to waste a lot of time

Love will find the answer
In every little thing you do
Love will find the answer
And it's always gonna come to you

If you just keep me in mind
'Cause there may not be a second time
Keep me in mind
For the rest of your life
Keep me in mind
For the rest of your life
Keep me in mind

You know I'm not someone
Who likes to use words like love
You know I'm not someone
Who likes to put myself above

Love will find the answer
In every little thing you do
Love will find the answer
And it's always gonna come to you

If you just keep me in mind
'Cause there may not be a second time
Keep me in mind
For the rest of your life
Keep me in mind
For the rest of your life
Keep me in mind

Love will find the answer
And it's always gonna come to you

If you just keep me in mind
'Cause there may not be a second time
Keep me in mind
For the rest of your life
Keep me in mind
For the rest of your life
Keep me in mind



And the crows are coming in wide
I could leave here for a while
At the most I’m leaving inside
Just suppose I’m killing time
Since the tide’s still keeping me here
Maybe I’m just feeling fine
And this smile is never sincere

I could be somebody
I could be somebody else
I could save some money
I could be somewhere else

Sell up and follow the signs
Get up and feel ourselves
Get up on the winning side
Sit up and see what sells

Just suppose I’m nearly done
And the crows are coming in fast
I could stay here for a while
At the most I’m staying inside
Just suppose I’m killing time
Since the tide’s still keeping me here
Maybe I’m just feeling well
And this smile is never sincere

I could be somebody
I could be somebody else
I could save some money
I could be somewhere else

Sell up and follow the signs
Get up and feel ourselves
Get up on the winning side
Sit up and see what sells

I could be somebody
I could be somebody else
I could save some money
I could be somewhere else

Sell up and follow the signs
Get up and feel ourselves
Get up on the winning side
Sit up and see what sells



No one gets out alive, I’ve heard it said
I reach to the sky & find a hole in the middle
Look straight down & see hell’s hot griddle
Leap in the moon with a hey diddle diddle

Precious dear, take a good close look at me
Never know if it’s the last time you’ll see
This transitory piece of celestial matter
One more seed that has been scattered
I once was former, I’ll soon be latter

I’m just passin’ through
Just passin’ through

It’s a sweet short ride through a beautiful place
If you can’t dig it, it’s a real disgrace
It’s a miracle, but commonplace

Seems to me a bad rap’s laid on death
As though you're weak to breathe your own last breath
Aint as if I don’t really love livin’
Not the least bit tired of the takin’ & the givin’
When I go, it’ll all be forgiven

I’m just passin’ through
I’m just passin’ through

And it’s a sweet short ride through a beautiful place
If you can’t dig it, it’s a real disgrace
It’s a miracle, but commonplace



I wanna be your t-shirt when its wet
I wanna be the shower when you sweat
I got to be the tattoo on your skin
Yeah let me be your bed baby, when you climb in

I wanna be the sheets when you sleep

From your feet up to your hair

And it makes me, it breaks me
Out of you and into me, I'll make it
So take a look at what you do to my head
When you're leaving, I'm breathing
Out of me and into you, I feel sick
I feel sick

Now that you're leaving
It complicates our lives
But I am the reason
That I will stay alive

We are the energy
We are the same as you
Take everything you need
We are the answer to
The broken, breaking through
Take everything from me

Every now and then I dream about you
I've lost the feeling, it's dead skin
I will never be dependent again
And every now and then I think about you
It's bringing me closer to closure
Every now and then I know it's over
It's over

Now that you're leaving
It complicates our lives
But I am the reason
That I will stay alive

We are the energy
We are the same as you
Take everything you need
We are the answer to
The broken, breaking through
Take everything from me

We are the energy
We are the same as you
Take everything you need
We are the answer to
The broken, breaking through
Take everything from me
Cause I'm not dying
No I'm not dying
Today



Everything's been said, A hunderd times

Then I know, if I know you
It takes one more time
No one holds the night,
The way you do
No one holds the night
The way you do
Then I know, If I know you
It takes one more night

No one makes it right
Like you do Like you do
No one makes it right
Like you do Like you do
No one makes it right like you

I guess you're moving out
So you say
I guess you're moving out
So you say
Oh I know if I know you
I've got no more saying 

No one makes it right
Like you do Like you do
No one makes it right
Like you do Like you do
No one makes it right like you

I said it once
I said it always



She's staring into the glass
And I need conversation like I need another drink
Knowing these rivers are bound to pass
Don't know the words 'cause they're always changing
Oh, but I think I know what she means
Trapped in a motel and the sound of our lips
Lookin' around for Jeane
Lookin' around for Jeane
Nineteen years and nothing, baby where do I begin
Wait till you're 23
She said she knew some late night place that'd let us in
Outside it started to freeze
Don't know the words 'cause they're always changing
Oh, but I think I know what she means
Trapped in a motel and the sound of our lips
Lookin' around for Jeane
Lookin' around for Jeane
Lookin' around for Jeane
Lookin' around for Jeane



And I'm never letting go
You know I'm happy just to linger
And let the feeling flow

This must be an illusion
I know this can't be real
I'm ready and right now
This is paradise I feel

Never thought I'd find someone to move me
Someone who could see right through me
You've found your way into my head
Where even angels fear to tread

Don't wanna go out walkin'
Don't wanna take a drive
Don't wanna move from this sweet spot, baby
While this feeling's still alive

The way we fit together
Its like we're meant to be
I'm ready and right now
This is paradise to me

Never thought I'd find someone to move me
Someone who could see right through me
You've found your way into my head
Where even angels fear to tread

You've found your way into my head
where even angels fear to tread



That you can't give into 
Forcing myself back
Now I can't talk to you 
Maybe I should realize there's a chance that 
I was never meant to be with you 

So just leave me standing 
Never make that promise 
You're aware your feelings aren't for me
Forcing you to believe in something real 
I cannot hurt you 
Run away, I wont complain 
It's all my fault
Meaning as observed by you

You see me beg and plead 
It's what I always do 
I guess I got off track 
Oh, I must be confused 
Maybe I should realize there's a chance that 
I was never meant to be with you 

So just leave me standing 
Never make that promise 
You're aware your feelings aren't for me
Forcing you to believe in something real 
I cannot hurt you 
Run away, I wont complain 
It's all my fault
Meaning as observed by you

Would you care 
If I was scared? 
Would you care 
If I was scared? 
I am...
For you 

So just leave me standing 
Never make that promise 
You're aware your feelings aren't for me
Forcing you to believe in something real 
I cannot hurt you 
Run away, I wont complain 
It's all my fault
Meaning as observed by you



And I'm looking for the Lord in New York City

Yeah I'm out on the run, got some heat, got a gun
If they don't find me soon, it'll be a damn pity

So it's

Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
It's so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
Must be in the way that she cries, must be in the way that she cries
Must be in the way that she cries

Oh there's smoke in the air and there's blood everywhere
But I'm hoping that the white man don't recognize me

I'm so sorry what I've done, and I say it not in fun
When I tell you that there's no one left inside me

And it's

Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
It's so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
Must be in the way that she cries, must be in the way that she cries
Must be in the way that she cries

So it's

Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
It's so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye
Must be in the way that she cries, must be in the way that she cries
Must be in the way that she cries



Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'd love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the Various Sorrows
Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On an endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her
Still I seemed so obselete and small
I found God and all His devils insider her
In my bed she cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

She had a heartful of love and devotion
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well, I try, I do, I really try
But I just err, baby, I do, I error
So come and find me, my darling one
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of her legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

All things move toward their end
I knew before I met her that I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I swear I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle



Shake off your shoes and
Kick off your boots
That's what she said to me
The world is a possibility

You know, know, know
Still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm
Hmm, mm, mm

Sometimes I'm an invisible me
You can't see, but I can't notice a thing
I am a walk green with your pile of things
Never fit into your plan

Even though I've grown old
I still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm

Grandma said when she took me inside
Gonna make minimal changes in life
Gonna make minimal space this time
Just make sure you don't lose your mind

Oh even though I've grown old
I still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm
Hmm, mm, mm

Find myself and that's for sure
Whether you're rich or whether your poor
And when the hand is broken, open comes the door
Lead tonight, what you waiting for?

Even though I've grown old
I still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm

My grandma, man she dead and gone
Me, I'm still travellin' on
Adopt the night phase into dawn
Stars of night fade in the morning time

Even though I've grown old
I still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm

You know I am still young
I still believe in everything I've done
Hmm, mm, mm
Hmm, mm, mm
Hmm, mm, mm



Some people get the kicks out of throwing bricks at me
No real reason, just jealousy
Angry words and bad attitudes is gonna get you nowhere

Watching you watching me, it's alright, 'cos I will make it right

Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on
Love is a fire, a burning desire, it's so warm oh

Some believe in the almighty dollar, some don't believe in nothing at all
There's a power that's within you, it will never never ever let you down

I'm the way, I'm the key to liberty and unity, are you listening

Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on
Love is a fire, a burning desire, it's so warm oh 

One hundred million voices singing can you hear the voices singing
No weak, no strong, no right, no wrong - imagine you gotta keep imagining
Impossible, the sceptics say,wait and see there's gonna come a day

Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on
Love is a fire, a burning desire, it's so warm oh

Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on
Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on

There's no difference between black or white, the light of life
I can hear the children laughing
Men at war, stop your worries, give peace a chance, there's a new day dawning
Come together, come together, come together
Wisdom is the mouth of peace, of innocence



Cannot hear your cries
Pleading please just go away
I can't take another day of this

No surprise, a surplus of lies 
Freed from the skies
Is there something that I missed?
Can't even take another day of this

Lower than piss, have you ever felt like this?
She can't recall the last time she avoided it
Lower than piss, have you ever felt like this?
Judging by your eyes like crystal balls
Madam Me is predicting that your answer will be yes

The sunrise burned out your eyes
Failed to apologize
As it was eating at your face
Took your smile away without a trace of it

Warmer than piss, have you ever felt like this?
It just might take a fever to encounter it
Knee deep in shit there's no avoiding it
From your knees you're coated brown
To your toes, there is no sound like this

And I will keep you warm in hell
And I will keep you warm in hell
And I will keep you warm in hell
Way down in hell



Not felt in any year 
I went silent 
Nothing except 
For some violent stares 
In the direction of you 
I can't stand it 
You, be aware 
That any man will fight 
For his children 
Even if they don't 
Have children 
They will fight until 
The last hit 

Some of us fear loneliness 
Others will caress 
The thought that they will 
Always be alone 
Even if you have a lover 
And you're right on top 
Yeah in your mind there's 
Only room for one 

You do it to yourself 
You misunderstood what 
This is really about and 
Whatever happened to you 
You're so cute 
Troubles will come and go 
But this time 
You are the problem 
You should have made 
A decision 
A long time ago 

Some of us fear loneliness 
Others will caress 
The thought that they will 
Always be alone 
Even if you have a lover 
And you're right on top 
Yeah in your mind there's 
Only room for one 

Nowhere to go my brain is 
Numb from thinking it over 
This can't go on any longer 
Someone has to  
Make a move no can do 
You're so special 
That it's kinda starting 
To bore me 
You're sucking me dry 
It annoys me 
You're making me sick 

I got this knife to unglue 
Everything we're stuck in 
Together we can 
Make it all go up in flames 
And then we'll have  
To do with nothing 
Maybe we can start 
Something 
Baby you won't have 
To be alone



Danger

Danger
In each passing stranger
Why do you always make me want you so?
When you're still meeting him where lights are low
You vowed your love to me, but I know there could be danger
In each passing stranger

What happened to the girl I used to know?
The one girl that I loved and trusted so
Now when you walk with me
Each guy we pass could be danger
Danger

Everyone knows Everyone knows
It's him you chose
When are you gonna tell me?

I can see I can see
...
'Cause me you were just teasin', his lips you were pleasin'

You vowed your love to me, but I know there could be danger danger
You vowed your love to me, but I know there could be danger danger

You vowed your love to me, but I know there could be danger danger



Cos I had the blues, the blues of throwing it all away
Just gimme a Tequila, I'll slam it the 4-D way
And when I got there you know it had certain similarities

Like no smoking anywhere
And hiding in the khazi to avoid paying the fare
4-D Tequila anyone?
And dont think we didn't dance to records by the Fifth Dimension
In the discosphere like Kublai Khan, Kublai Khan

And it was pretty goddam hazardous
Out on the Illminster by-pass, out on the Illminster by-pass
Out on the Illminster by-pass - out on the Illminster by-pass
Aqua-planing to the theme park
We took a ride called the Banchoff-Klein mega bottle ride
Well, how we spewed inside, back and forth
In time, mathmatics and pride, inside

We've gone Balkan - we've gone Balkan anyway
It absolutely had to happen to someone today
Yeah, there's no smoking anywhere - throw it all away
Yeah, we've gone Balkan anyway - you can get rid of the blues this way
Yeah, that's how we fix the blues today
It absolutely had to happen to someone today
Yeah, there's no smoking anywhere - throw it all away
Yeah, we've gone Balkan anyway - you can get rid of the blues this way
Yeah, that's how we fix the blues today - throw it all away
And its time to be doing something good



I always find a way to pass the time with you
Dark and smoky rooms, I can hardly stand the fumes
Telling me that you mean no harm
You stand me up like a crutch, another arm
But only when I'm gone have I been away too long?

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

Any given time or place I never will forget the disgrace on your face
So full of love, will it ever be enough?
Ten feet fall and bullet proof I never thought I had a thing to lose
Well, it looks like after all, I'm gonna have to choose

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

You help pass the time, but I'm doing fine on my own
So there's no good reason to live such a lie
Tell me have I been gone away too long?

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone



White the night, foggy day
Over the frozen ground
Gloaming light, not a sound
Left behind comfort and family
To find this land, across the sea
We are the lost and found
The malcontents, the emmigrants

Drawn by a call deep within
To build on a dream, to imagine
Vista that seem to never end
Valley and river bend
Mountain glen
This island home.

Hokkaido Was Ezo
Hokkaido Was Ezo

Wintertime the way is soft and deep
Stay inside, eat and sleep
Mochi gashi, sugar beet and tea
Fish and coal, timber tree
Springtime kouroshio waters run
Plant the rice, wait for sun
Children sing the baby salmon song
Don't get lost, or hit the rocks

Drawn by a call deep within
To build on a dream, to imagine
Vista that seem to never end
Valley and river bend
Mountain glen
This island home.

Hokkaido Was Ezo
Hokkaido WasEzo



What's the going rate on Heaven up above?
I feed on the plans that I've made up to now

What's the going rate on accountability?
What's the going rate on you versus me?
I'm far from the walls and the trust that keep me here

I'm stuck in the mud
It's stuck in my mind
How we're running out of time

Bent out of shape but I'm on the up and up
Pulled out my roots, yes, I have
Wasted so much on everything but this
It's my fix, it's my fix, it's my fix

What's the going rate on making this thing right?
What's the going rate on staying out all night?
It's hard to believe in the things I trust the most

And so many signs
How many ways
Can I deceive my yesterdays?

Bent out of shape but I'm on the up and up
Pulled out my roots, yes, I have
Wasted so much on everything but this
It's my fix, it's my fix, it's my fix

Oh, can you be bigger than this?
Can you be stronger than this?
We're counting on you

Everything's waiting on you
Everything's focused on you
To do what you should do

Bent out of shape but I'm on the up and up
Pulled out my roots, yes, I have
Wasted so much on everything but this
It's my fix, it's my fix, it's my fix

Bent out of shape but I'm on the up and up
Pulled out my roots, yes, I have
Wasted so much on everything but this
It's my fix, it's my fix, it's my fix



It's no fun burning for one
I was happy before you came
Lord know as hard as it is, as hard as it is

Now you've gone, it's just not the same
He knows just how hard it is
It drives me mad not now having you
They know how hard it is
Lord knows as hard as it is, as hard as it is

I missed you bad, I want you now my darling,
They know how hard it is
Lord know as hard as it is, as hard as it is
Lord knows as hard as it is, as hard as it is
He knows just how hard it is



‘Cause I could never find nobody to make me feel this way
Stay, baby, don't go away
‘Cause I could never find nobody to make me feel this way

I won't be able to sleep peacefully
In bed without beside me, darling, darling, any more
I won't be warm and secure
Oh baby, baby, baby, like I was before

I'll just lie tossing and turning
Oh baby, baby, baby, all night long
Scared that if I closed my eyes
When I got ready to wake up I might find you gone

Stay, baby, don't go away
‘Cause I could never find nobody to make me feel this way
Stay, baby, don't go away
‘Cause I could never find nobody to make me feel this way

No, I never felt, never felt this way before
No, I never felt, never felt this way before
Baby, I never felt, never felt this way before



That melt and drip and burn and scar,
Who's got eyes as black as tar?
It's the lady at the bar.

And who's that standing at the door?
She said don't come round here no more,
So who's that standing at the door?
I don't know you anymore.

Try, try, try my hardest,
Well I,
Try, try, try my hardest,
Well I.

Hey now what's the big idea?
Don't bring those good looks round here,
What's the matter with my heart?
It's the girl with eyes like tar.

So who's that standing at the door?
She said don't come round here no more,
So who's that standing at the door?
I don't know you anymore.

I try, try, try my hardest,
Well I,
Try, try, try my hardest,
Well I







Lost all the air and it slowed my speed. 
?Ridin' in along trees? and air vents and memories
And looking both ways for cars
I've been kicked around all my life
I'll be leaving now
Me and my bike. 

Am I the only one out in the sun?
Out on the street?
And it's lovely weather 
And I think so. 

Be mine, stay mine
Your soft fingertips 
Touch my ear
Just to see you
Just to know you
Just to hold you close
Just to see you!

It makes me want to get out of my house
In a canoe, express my love for only you
Pack my stuff and want to move. 
I'm staying in. 
No way. 
Not today. 
No way.
Not today.
No way.



And play the air guitar
I like to keep my suitcase packed, cause I'm going far
I think you're nice but
I don't wanna waste my time
I may seem crazy, but don't worry I'm just fine

All the way up
All the way down
Never look back
It's time to breakout
I want it my way

It's a ride that takes you 
All the way up
All the way down
Never look back it's time to breakout

I like to go out walking
In the pouring rain
I want my rock n' roll to
Make the window shake
I wait 'til three a.m.
To call everyone I know
I'm gonna bring the noise
I'm ready here we go

All the way up
All the way down
Never look back
It's time to breakout
I want it my way
I do what I do
I know what I like
And maybe it's you

Flying too close to the sun
If the moment of glory
Is over before it's begun
If the dream is won
Though everything is lost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost

When the dust has cleared
And victory denied
A summit too lofty
River a little too wide
If we keep our pride
Though paradise is lost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost
Oh, oh

And if the music stops
There's only the sound of the rain
All the hope and glory
All the sacrifice in vain
And if love remains
Though everything is lost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost

And if love remains
Though everything is lost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost
And if love remains
Though everything is lost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost
And if love remains



My life was torn asunder
And I was carried far away

Now somewhere in the distance
I feel a strange insistance
I long to be there once again

The day is drawing nearer
The time has come to leave here
The feeling just keeps gettin' stronger every day

So I pray for the moment when I'll be with you
And all that we hoped for is all comin' true
When the time we've spent waitin' is finally through
I'll be home again

I can still remember
Days that never ended
Standin' on a distant shore

With every raindrop fallin'
I hear the thunder callin'
Like so many times before

Sometimes in the darkness
I hear what my heart says
Maybe one day I'll know what that feelings for

So I wait for the moment when I'll be with you
And all that we hoped for is all comin' true
The time we've spent waitin' is finally through
I'll be home again

When you're out there on your own
It can chill you to the bone
There's a cold wind blowin'
But it feels good knowin'
The worst is over now - I'm finally goin' home

It's gettin' stronger
Can't wait any longer



For your theories of romance,
I know, that you doubt me, but without me,
You'd be tearin' up your one chance.

Wait and see, 
This could be the last time for me,
Baby, just wait and see.

All the times, I came runnin' back,
Down the path, of the least resistance,
I, thought my body, was just a hobby,
For your heart's indifference.

Wait and see,
This could be the last time for me,
Now baby, can't you wait and see,
Just you wait and see,
Just you wait and see,
Just you wait and see.

Ohhh, wait and see,
This could be the last time for me,
Baby, just wait and see.

I've been trapped by your innocence,
Haven't seen you since, you caught me baby,
Shut down by the one I love,
Now I'm taking off,
With the things you taught me.

Wait and see,
This could be the last time for me,
Ohh baby, can't you wait and see,
Just you wait and see,
Just you wait and see,
Can't you wait, can't you wait and see,
Just you wait and see.



One night she went out for smokes
And they took her apart like a rag-doll
In the back of a van

In an Alabama motel room
I've one of them tied up in the bathroom
I am down and out
But he will not get away with it again

When the night comes in I hope I'm out of the rain
When the night comes in she makes me whole again

I never sleep
And I just watch TV
And the gun, it lies next to me
Whispering

In an Alabama motel room
I reflect on her sweet perfume
And I am down and out
But they will not get away with it again

When the night comes in I hope I'm out of the rain
When the night comes in she makes me whole again
When the night comes in I hope I'm out of the rain
When the night comes in

Say you love me
We will never get the chance again
We will never get the chance again
Say you love me
We will never get the chance again
We will never get the chance again

When the night comes in I hope I'm out of the rain
When the night comes in she makes me whole again
When the night comes in I hope I'm out of the rain
When the night comes in I hope I'm out of the rain



But it's not like we're really gonin' somewhere
Yeah we could steal away
But it's not gonna happen

Yeah we could steal away
Ah we could leave today
We could run away

So why don't you leave through the door
You've felt this way before
You've felt this way
-it's good
Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey

I've got this bloodshot adult commitment
I get my kicks when I get old
Bloodshot adult commitment
For now I do as I've been told

Bloodshot adult commitment
Old enough to pay
Young enough to kick around, ah to kick around
Bloodshot adult commitment
Piss my guts into a hole in the ground
Ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah

Bloodshot adult commitment
Lends no hand not until you beg, please, please man
Bloodshot adult commitment
Piss running down the inside of your leg
Now you know I'm far from satisfied

Bloodshot adult commitment
Goggle eyed man says: I think you should have this,
You say: I don't need this, no I don't need this, oh
Bloodshot adult commitment
Slips you a note, you say: I can't read this
Ah, I can't read this

Bloodshot adult commitment
Now you know I'm far from satisfied
Some day, some day, so long
Yeah we could steal away
Ah, let them wait today
Ah we could steal away

Yeah, we could steal away
We could leave today
Ah we could run away
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I've got this bloodshot adult commitment
Bloodshot adult commitment
Bloodshot adult commitment
Bloodshot adult commitment
Now you know I'm far from satisfied
You know I'm far from satisfied
You know I'm far from satisfied
You know I'm far from satisfied
Bloodshot adult commitment
Bloodshot, bloodshot, bloodshot
We could leave, come along
But you know, don't you, don't you, alright

Thirty-five dollars and a six pack to my name
Six-pack!
Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame
Six-pack!
They say I'm fucked up all the time
Six pack!
What they do is a waste of time
Six pack!

I know it'll be OK
I get a six pack in me, alright!

My girlfriend asks me which one I like better
Six pack!
I hope the answer won't upset her
Six pack!
I was born with a bottle in my mouth
Six pack!
Now I got a six, so I'll never run out
Six pack!

Please share my umbrella
Bus stop, bus goes, she stays, love grows
Under my umbrella

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we employed it
By August, she was mine

Every morning I would see her waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shopped and she would show me what she bought
All the people stared as if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinkin' of a sweet romance
Beginning in a queue

Came the sun the ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to a vow

Every morning I would see her waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shopped and she would show me what she bought
All the people stared as if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same

Bus stop, wet day, she's there, I say
Please share my umbrella
Bus stop, bus goes, she stays, love grows
Under my umbrella

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we employed it
By August, she was mine

And every morning I would see her waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shopped and she would show me what she bought
All the people stared as if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same

Bus stop, wet day, she's there, I say
Please share my umbrella

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we employed it
By August, she was mine



Up at the Northtown Mall
As a matter of fact
I didn't even know that that's where it happened

I was France Ave when they came out dancing
I was Lyndale South, I was kicking it with cousins
We were talking about going clubbing
But instead we just started drinking

I've been straight since the Cinco de Mayo
But before that I was blotto, I was blacked out
I was cracked out, I was caved in
You should have seen all these portals that I've powered up in

We started recreational
It ended kinda medical
It came on hot and soft
And then it tightened up its tentacles

I wasn't there
I was blind, high, I was scared
I was Lake and Columbus, I was cutting off all my hair
I was unfurling a flag of defiance aimed at my guidance guy

So this is it
This is the end of the session
I ain't gonna be taking any more questions
I think my attorney's gonna second that motion

It started recreational
It ended kinda medical
It came on hot and soft
And then it tightened up its tentacles

The band played 
And we agreed, this world is mostly manacled
It started ice cream social nice
It ended up all white and ecumenical

There are guys, there are guys, there are guys, there are guys
With wild eyes when they ask to get you high
There are girls, there are girls, there are girls, there are girls
That will come to you with comfort in the night, thats right

We started recreational
It ended up all medical
It came on hot and soft and then
It tightened up its tentacles

The band played 
You thought it was stoney and adorable
It started in the vestibule
It ended in the hospital

There are guys, there are guys, there are guys, there are guys
With the wild eyes when they ask to get you high
There are girls, there are girls, there are girls, there are girls
That'll come to you with comfort in the night

There are nights, there are nights, there are nights, there are nights
When it all comes on a little bit too bright
There's a cross, there's a cross, there's a cross, there's a cross
And in the center there is a hot soft light



It's such a shame that you just left me

I came in second and I'm in a marathon

I gain on you some day just trust me

I can't believe what I just witnessed here today

A thousand memories just fade and fly away

I'll find you someday in the middle of the war

I can't believe that you don't need me anymore

I brought the humor and a smile to fit your face

I won't hear the words you will tell me

I brought the liquor and the drunken attitude

I can't believe that you can hate me

I can't believe what I just witnessed here today

A thousand memories just fade and fly away

I'll find you someday in the middle of the war

I can't believe that you don't need me anymore

I crawl back into the pieces of our plane

I wish that we could fly again



It's just a long flight home,
The last touch in the morning
Is forever gone,

Mmm, oh baby, I want to hold you once again
Mmm, baby, it would never be the same
Never again, will I look into your eyes
Never again,

Never again, will I hold you late at night
Never again.
Tomorrow's waiting,
It's time for me to go,

You don't have to say a thing
'Cause we will always know,
Mmm, oh baby, we were lovers with a smile
Yeah, baby, we had it all for a little while.

Never again, will I look into your eyes
Never again,
Never again, will I hold you late at night
Never again.

Never again, will I look into your eyes
Never again,
Never again, will I hold you late at night
Never again.

Never again, will I look into your eyes
Never again,
Never again, will I hold you late at night
Never again.

Never again, ohhhh...



I need somebody or else I'm gonna die
Oh, love, if you need me, just call and I'll be there
There is no sorrow that both of us can't share
That both of us can't share
Love, don't you despair ...



To forget dead friends,
Just a goodbye.
Should I stay, should I pay?
Can't go back,
I know life goes on, it's too late.

I'm holding on, the smell of need,
I'm carring on, down on my knees, yes I try
To come with you.
The long lost friend, endtime,
They sleep in mud, you see,
Who's got the right to survive?
I'm holding on.



and a showbiz son
Always hide
where you come from
Mother got out rehab
And I was born
I was starstruck
When I was young
It's never too soon
To tread the boards
I was in Vaudeville
At age gave
My career took
Its first nosedive
I've been starstruck
All my life
Starstruck,
starstruck over you
Starstruck,
I'm struck dumb by you
Starstruck,
I struck out of luck
I was always starstruck
Can't get an agent
For a child star
My act effete and failing
So I moved
To the old backlot
Where I exercise daily
Now you're between
A peak time show
I hear you're now married
She was born to be seen
Not to be carried



So it should come as no surprise, 
That your big balloon is gonna burst, 
Right before your eyes.

Well you always call your mama, 
Just for sympathy yeah, 
But I tried to show you years ago, 
So don't come crying to me.
Now it's your last chance the night is over, 
Last chance for love, 
Well you can blame it on the bosanova,
You can't blame me when I'm gone.
Well you call me up for favours, 
You say that it's my turn, 
Well I think I'll stand on my hard earned drive,
And watch your bridges burn.

Well I saw my Guardian Angel, 
He said I can refuse, 
Well I'd take the chance but it's hard to dance, 
With size 8 concrete shoes.<

Well you take it all for granted, 
So it should come as no surprise, 
That your big balloon is gonna burst,
Right before your eyes.



Set your mind to see where I stand
And show me my broken home

I'll sell my heart, I see no use
I can't explain the things I do
It's all I've ever known
So show me my broken home

There's blood on my sleeve
My knees are weak trying
So preach on you Jesus freaks
I'm inspired
And now that I'm alone
I ain't so tired

When did my life start to mean
Starving on a sucker's dream?
It's all I've ever known
So show me my broken home

There's blood on my sleeve

My knees are weak trying
So preach on you Jesus freaks
I'm inspired
And now that I'm alone
I ain't so tired

Oh tell me can you hear me now?
Tell me are you alright?
Is there anybody out there?
Smokin' mirrors in the moonlight
I'm alone but I'm only growing old

There's blood on my sleeve
My knees are weak trying
So preach on you Jesus freaks
I'm inspired
And now that I'm alone
I ain't so tired



I’ve been hollow way too long 
I know where I’m going wrong 
There’s nothing I can do 
I believe you can get me through 
Nothing else will do 
I believe you can get me through 
So can you stop the bleeding? 
Get me through… 

Color blind I paint your blue sky grey 
But this time you’ll shed some light on me 
Just before I fade away 
There’s nothing I can do 
I believe you can get me through 
Nothing else will do 
I believe you can get me through 
So can you stop the bleeding? 
Get me through… 

All the chances that you’re takin’ 
The promises that I keep breaking down 
Writings on the wall 
Can’t make out all the letters 
But I know it’s getting better now 
The writings on the wall 

Get me through… 

There’s nothing I can do 
I believe you can get me through 
Nothing else will do 
I believe you can get me through 
So can you stop the bleeding? 
Get me through…



The prisoner is loose,
The wheel has come around,
And the velvet curtain coming down.
And I left it there,
A suitcase on a chair.
I feel my weight
And something tells me
There's a river underground,
In a place where there's no one to be found.

And no one came to see
The oldest show in town
And no one came to see
The oldest show in town
And no one came to see
The oldest show in town

Santa's on the cross.
Innocence is lost.
The music's in your mind,
And the windscreen wipers move in time.

No one came to see
The oldest show in town
No one came to see
The oldest show in town

And the stranger was a ghost
The killer was a priest
Took the first excuse
Made the madness seem cute lipped
On your own you'll find your own escape
There are many ways to choose
And I don't know which one you should take

A home is all you want
On the back of a truck driving down the street
It doesn't seem so much
But it's all you need to make your life complete

No one came to see
The oldest show in town
No one came to see
The oldest show in town
No one came to see
The oldest show in town

No one came to see
I lean the slightest bit towards you
White turns into brown, light goes to black
Your eyes danced in my reflection
And the horse ate my trousers



Reflected the rain in your eyes
The trees pass by like Van Gogh's brush
What were you leaving behind?

The frosted shine like broken glass
The canyon comes into view
The road is warm, all cracked and torn
From the others that came before

It ain't over, ain't it good to be alive
It ain't over, close your eyes and drive,
Close your eyes and drive

Through it all I've had no doubts
Truth couldn't be farther away
But I hit bottom and didn't bounce
And found out I had nothing to say

Are we running toward or running from
Or maybe not running at all
I just know when we least expect it
Something are just destined to fall

It ain't over, ain't it good to be alive
It ain't over, close your eyes and drive,
Close your eyes and drive

I saw you standing in the crowd
Show box, Saturday night
Seven summers have passed since then
Are the stars still shining as bright?

The moving village of your space-time world
Iron fist is far behind you
Levitation in a whiskey swirl
Never even got to the show

It ain't over, ain't it good to be alive
It ain't over, close your eyes and drive,
Close your eyes and drive

It's all too much in my mind
The experience is gone before it's even here

There was love on my mind in the weekdays
And a longing for someone in the night
It was just a strive for what i can't have

Stay by my side
As we hope for someone to show
Don't leave my side
Though it's not what we hoped for

You may take what you need when you want to
And use me up if you wish
Feelings stay the same since i'm asleep

There was hope for a sense of belonging
And a story was played in my mind
A daydream's just enoug for the state that i'm in

Stay by my side
As we hope for someone to show
Don't leave my side
Though it's not what we hoped for

I don't want feelings
I don't want songs
Stuck in my head too long
I don't need memories
To lean upon
When i know where i belong



You saw the spirit and
You're an ugly attack on wheels

Nail biting never taste so good
Power lines big schedules

Beginning to starve myself
A minor example to illustrate
You sought escape
The autumns changed
Order of the day

Nail biting never taste so good
Power lines big schedules

Nationalism is rising
Developing aspirations

Organic, Dynamic, Exuberant



I try to find the truth between all the lies
When Bleeding is feeling and feeling ain't real
Will I see you when I open my eyes?
Will I see you when I open my eyes?

When Breathing's a burden we all have to bear
And trust is one thing we're taught never to share
Somehow you just seem to shine
When loving means breaking and saying goodbye

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe; a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you, I never get burned

Caught in a trap of what we're taught to believe
When night overcomes day, life's so hard to preceve
And the clock keeps on ticking through night-shattered skies
Where the stars are all broken, and so are all the ties
But the one thing remaining is you
When I'm broken and bleeding, you pull me right through

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe; a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you there's nothing I'd rather do

Than be right there
To escape my own life and all my fear
And I can't feel
Am I really real?
Come and wipe all my tears
Come and wipe all my tears

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe; a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you...

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe; a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you, I never get burned



Cause you know I'll never make it in my own
You're the blood in my veins
You're the fire burning deep inside
A bitter taste of today
Such as each one that passes
I'll fight this again tomorrow
Watch as the scales fall from my eyes
Another chance to overcome
A bitter taste of today


In a moment it can fade away
Our lives can change so fast
You're the blood in my veins
You're the fire burning deep inside
You'll see a change in me
Watch as the scales fall from my eyes
Go ahead and nail my...to the floor
Go ahead and nail my...to the floor
Go ahead and nail my...to the floor



Who will shut all these windows?
It's these windows all around me,
It's these windows who are telling me
To rid my dirty mind of all of its preciousness.

Where is my master, the Rebel Prince?
They're breaking everything trying to get to me
In this two-bed hotel,
Just to me before this window sill
Does it rid my dirty mind of all of its preciousness.

Oh I can see him now
Though it's so far away,
Amongst the roving crowd
Going the other way
Confounded anger burning with love for me.

Ou est mon maître le Prince Rebelle,
Qui va fermer toutes ces fenêtres ?
Ce sont ces fenêtres autour de moi,
Ce sont ces fenêtres qui m'appellent,
Qui m'appellent.

Marigold, marigold, marigold
I'm leaving the Roosevelt Hotel
Marigold, marigold, marigold
I'm leaving the room we knew so well.

Da da da da da da da da...

Marigold, marigold, marigold
Marigold, marigold, marigold
Marigold, marigold, marigold
Marigold, marigold, marigold



If you hear Stevie Wonder tell him I see
I don't want no songs for plants
I want songs for me
I don't want no songs for plants
I want liberty living in the city

If you see the doctor tell him he's king, Dr. Martin Luther
If you see the doctor tell him he's still king, you too Muhammed Ali
But this bad black boy won't be blown away by anything
Yes this bad black boy won't be blown away by anything

There are people in this town
That try to put me down
They say I don't give a damn
But the people in this town
That try to put me down
Are the people in the town
That could never understand a black man
Don't take it no more
Don't take it no more
Don't take it no more

There are people in the town
That try to put me down
They say I don't give a damn, damn
But the people in the town that try to put me down
Are the people in the town that could never understand a black man
Don't take it no more

If you see Robert Johnson, you too Robert Marley, Robert Mugabe
Now tell him I hear
If you see Malcom tell him I'm next, vexed
If you see Jimi, Jimi Hendrix
If you see my brothers tell them it's clear
I've been living on the wrong side
Now I hear
Don't take it no more
I don't take it no more
Mr. Joshua Nkomo
Don't take it no more
Jomo Kenyatta, oh no
Don't take it no more
Haile Selassi, Rastafarian
Don't take it no more
Professor Longhair
Don't take it no more



I get a little out of control
You mind your mama
Else she going to swallow you whole
Infect me, protect me
She going to resurrect me I know

'Cause, baby, I’m living from dime to dime
If down is up I think I’ll be doing all right tonight

And I roll
And it feels good around
I got sold
For nothing as it seems
Infect me, protect me
She going to resurrect me I know, I know

Bye, bye, butterfly
I get a little out of control
'Cause when the moon done get snuffed out
On your knees you’re going to see the sun cut down
Neglect me, select me
She going to disconnect me I know, I know, baby

And I roll
And it feels good around
I got sold
For nothing as it seems
Neglect me, select me
She going to resurrect me

And I roll
And it feels good around
I got sold
For nothing as it seems
Infect me, protect me
She going to resurrect me I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know, baby
I know



But I want want these words to be true.
I will always fight the fight
I will always sing for you.

Is this moment out of reach
Or the conversation done?
Theres some things you'll never see
You're so beautiful.

I'm out of time
We're out of line.

Through the rain, and the snow
We're gonna make it.
We'll throw our hands, in the air
Cause we're gonna make it.

But are we alive?
Yes you're alive
Yes you're alive.

All the fields of America
How it burns into my heart.
And my courage will define
If I sing or fall apart.

You're the hardest dream to chase
You're the hardest dream to face.
You're the only chance i'll take
You're the only chance..
To break away, To break away.

And through the rain, and the snow
We're gonna make it.
We'll throw our hands, in the air
Cause we're gonna make it.

But are we alive?
Yes you're alive

Yes you're alive.

The fireflies are comin'out
So we're gonna make it.
In the wind, I feel a change
We're gonna make it.

But are we alive?
Yes you're alive
Yes you're alive.

There's a feelin' in my veins
And I feel it every day.
There's a feelin' that I chase
How it leaves me with the sweetest taste, ooo ooo oooo.

And through the rain, and the snow
We're gonna make it.
We'll throw our hands, in the air
Cause we're gonna make it.

But are we alive?
Yes you're alive
Yes you're alive.

The fireflies are comin'out
So we're gonna make it.
In the end I feel it's just that
We're gonna make it.

Are we alive?
Yes you're alive
Yes you're alive.

Still so much to see
Come and chase this dream.



My body move
It goes without me
What I used to be
Prove it
A breath for you
No kiss
My tears they fly
In the wind
I blink you die
Cuz you believe
In what I can see
My body moves
It goes without me
It used to dance one two one two
It used to prance one two one two
Now I follow you
Forever
You compell me to
Fly.... flew..
I blink and see
Nothing
Forever
One two one two
I ache for you
My soul has got a hole
To see you through



Where the poltergeists play their video games
"On the roof" he says

"Game over" they said
"Game over" they said, run and get your quarters in
Over cliffs we will swim ahead

Do the shackles underneath your bed
Haunt the records in their grooves?
And he said "Inside of them"

Salem is home
Sentenced to live
Yes, this I know
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold

Run and get your quarters in

At the bottom of a french blue pool
Roamed the drunk chipped tooth
Of the man in the moon
"Jump on the roof" he said

Burn, furnace burn
At the bottom of the cliff
Shined a diamond with no end to its trip
Over cliffs we will swim ahead

Do the shackles underneath your bed
Haunt the records in their grooves?
And they said "It's all over"

Salem is home
Sentenced to live
Yes, this I know
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold

Hook and sinker
Hook and sinker
Hook and sinker
Hook and sinker

I wrote it all down for you
Match a name to the face, do you suspect?
Do you confess?
Do you confess?

Sentenced to live
Salem is home
Yes, this I know
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold



And she could drink more wine than I'd ever seen
She had some gypsies' blood flowing through her feet
And when the time was right she said that I would meet
My destiny

I traveled round the world to find the sun
I couldn't stop myself from having fun

And then one day I met an Indian girl
And she made me forget this troubled world
We're living in

I had a strange dream. In my hair
I saw a pearly queen lying there
And all around her feet flowers bloomed
But they were made of silk and sequins two by two



i never knew how to play your game.
and could you, could you cry, for me yeah
and bleed your eyes my soul to keep

i'd love to know your reasons
you keep your eyes away from me

a world of peace, where you pretend to live
i'll stay away so you don't have to think



and could you, could you cry for me yeah
and bleed your eyes, my soul to keep
i'd love to know your reasons
you keep your eyes away from me

could you cry for me yeah
and bleed your eyes my soul to keep, oh keep
i'd love to know your reasons
why cant you say your reasons
you keep your eyes away from me.



He once had a mind of his own,
So they took it away,
And quickly the damage is done.
Yes the heart disappears,
And gives way to despair,
They've got schemes and ideas,
But no loving and care.
And it needs that much more, needs it much more.

Well so much for your schemes,
So much for the things that you say,
While you're out chasing votes,
He's out chasing dragons all day.
So another child dies,
One more baby in black,
and the mother she cries,
As she's starting to crack,
And she can't take much more, no she can't take much more.

How many more times, must they shatter our trust,
Do we sit in silence,or stand up and scream in disgust.

I still have a dream, 
I still have a mind of my own,
They won't take it away,
Because I see the damages they've done.
I see one more boy dies,
One more baby in black,
hear a mother who cries,
But that don't bring him back.

How many times must we stand for their lies,
As the crocodile tears fill their eyes,
The suffering and hardship is not going to fall,
Try to call them again,
Because I can't take much more,
It's worth fighting for,
And we need love much more...



I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways

Trap you, then they use you
Before you even know
For love is blind, you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
Wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

Can-can's such a pretty show
They steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again
The dressing rooms are gray

They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
Love is blind and you will find
You're just a boy again

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
Wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
And if you want some more and she's fast asleep
Then she's twinkling with the stars

Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
Have to learn just like me and that's the hardest way

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
Wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
Wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

Ooh la la, ooh la la la la
Ooh la la, ooh la la la la
Ooh la la, ooh la la la la la la la
Ooh la la



Lyrics aside, then let it beat for someone else
Don't let your heart do the talking for your mind
You'll be living in the shadows of your secrets

Your heart has something I don't have
Your heart has something I want to have it anyway
I want to have it anyway

A little hope to give you hope
As doubt sets in your mind
And what you say is too kind
And it's not worth its patience
I was there I was there
I'd complain if I cared
And I'll use the words the way they make me sound

Your heart has something I don't have
Your heart has something I want to have it anyway
I want to have it anyway



But I'm still in hope
That one day all of my friends could be whole
For now you are broken and feel so unsure
Wherever we are, we can't go back to where we were

And I want to fly straight into the sun
I want to burn the two into one

I know it sounds foolish, but I'm still in love
Although I surrendered I've not given up
So if there is something that's making you stay
I'm standing right here I won't walk away

And I want to fly into the sun
I want to burn the two into one

And I've forgiven you
It's all I can do
It seems you have no choice when you love someone

I want you to know, you're whiter than snow
I want you to see, to forgive is to breathe
And it's something you need
Forget what you've done
I want to burn the two into one

Two into one, two into one, yes
Two into, two into one



Don't take any chances on me. 
I'm not the one you want, 
I'm not the one who'll say I love you,
I'm not the one who'll say I'll stay. 

I just want you out of my life, 
I said to you once, I won't say it twice 
I don't want your shit anymore, 
I know what you want, I've seen it before



The silver lining is coming through
Just say yes, just say yes, just say yes
Quit giving up so soon
Our love will win what war will lose

Every little bit of light
Every little bit of light
Helps get us through the night

Time fled from the west
Under a crescent moon
Feel the rattled sunset
The stars came unglued and the sky fell in
And the smoke withdrew from these ashes

Every little bit of light
Every little bit of light
Helps get us through the night these days

Just say yes, just say yes, just say yes
Quit giving up so soon
Our love will win what war will lose

Every little bit of light
Every little bit of light
Helps get us through the night these days



A man of steel is melting away
Becoming so weak and bending your ways
Ain't it great to be this way

I break your cage and you're running free
I'll act his age, let's be with me
I'll rust your face, we'll find your place
I'll break your cage, and you're running free with me

Ain't it great to be this way
A man of steel is melting away
Becoming so weak and bending your ways
Ain't it great to be this way

I break your cage and you're running free
I'll act his age, let's be with me
I'll rust your face, we'll find your place
I'll break your cage, and you're running free with me

I break your cage and you're running free
I'll act his age, let's be with me
I'll rust your face, we'll find your place
I'll break your cage, and you're running free with me



Keep your money in your hand
Look out where you're heading mamma
Don't go running blind
Shine light and strut it out
Keep your ear right to the ground
Watch out for the strange cats
When the strange cats crawl around

Keep your eyes wide open
Hold your head up high
You are now a stranger here
So much changes with the side
Run out of fortune
She would lend a helping hand
Do not turn your back on the lady
When the lady comes around

Don't turn around
Just look away
Don't turn around
Just look away

Dancin' down main street
And it's good to the stroll
Ain't no time to look around
It's time to get out the hole
No one cares about the fool
Who longs to find the gold
A thought to own a chance to plan 
and sacrificed his soul

Don't turn around
Just look away
Don't turn around
Just look away

Then you find it's up to you
When you'll know you've got it
Then you're glad it could be true
Then you'll know you've lost it

Paper lap but I did find
Your money's in control
Just bide your time a second more
And it's mine before you go
Stop a while to count the tears
In view from afar
The pain of love is put aside
The time for healin' starts

Don't turn around
Just look away
Don't...

Then you find it's up to you
When you'll know you've got it
Then you're glad it could be true
Then you'll know you've lost it

An' an' an' an' an' an' an'
And you've got it
An' and he's got it
Aw you got it
You got it
You've got it
We got it
They got it
We got it
Everybody's got it
Oh
But keep yo' money in yo' hand
Ah no...



In crystal waters I'll be bound
Cold as stone, weary to the sounds upon the wheel

Now be thankful for good things below
Now be thankful to your maker
For the rose, the red rose blooms for all to know

When the fire is grown too fierce to breathe
In burning irons I'll be bound
Fierce as fire weary to the sounds upon the wheel

Now be thankful for good things below
Now be thankful to your maker
For the rose, the red rose blooms for all to know

When the stone is grown too cold to kneel
In crystal waters I'll be bound
Cold as stone, weary to the sounds upon the wheel

Now be thankful for good things below
Now be thankful to your maker
For the rose, the red rose blooms for all to know



a dirty little minute 
that was an hour ago 
oh don't censor me 
so bitterly 
there's no change 
the sun goes down 

i'm ready for it 
i'm ready for it 

the days seem to past 
clouds move too fast 
about an hour ago 
we hit a tree 
we bruised your knee 
keep on saying you love me 

im ready for it 
im ready for it 

loving you's a black hole 

i'm ready for it



Won't you pass that mic right here
you know i will not f**kin drop it
so you thought that i would stop it 
but i got more shits in my pocket

i say don't duh dont dont drop it,
the funky beat x3

this is how we kick it
and this is how we do it
this original styles mine
so why would you ruin it
so you thought that G was all washed up 
but the ring around the collar is so damn tough
you know i'm not the type of brutha like enoughs enough
and what you want to start something
when you start it all
see i flow like the breeze
right down the road
mind my own biz you I find my mother load
im getting paid in the shade
for the words that i say
with the rules that i play
for the moves that i make
its amazing just like the boy
peter paker sink white as a cloud my souls deep
and deep gets my stuff
the deep that you did
the best tasting water in the bottom of the well
raining like a thunderstorm
and you about to get wet cause the heat is on
coming up
coming on
coming on x3
im coming up 
im coming on
im coming

i got the blues brother
like dan aykroyd
i smoke a lotta weed
but it dont get paranoid
dont freak
i got the flavors like lemonade
my stock is steady rising like i'm on etrade
i dont date a girl with the thunder thighs
i got the mai tai special with the light brown eyes
to make the bread you must have the rise
it pays it pays to adverstise
but i wont shove my shit right down your throat
and if you like my freestyle then check out what i wrote


my styles on lockdown
so please dont pick my brain
tongue twister try to stump me
so i broke the chain
breaka breaka one-nine
you know my cover is blown
so lets fire up this joint on the microphone
see i rock the party hard but the party wont break
said the neighbors were cool but you made a mistake
damn the cops are coming im running out the back door
jump over the fence you never see me no more
im coming on coming on coming
im coming up
im coming on
im coming



It didnt change the way I feel
And I was wishing I'd break down your walls
The kiss will know if lips stay still
There is a line I crossed
And when you  missed I lost
I'm not a loser
Girl, you know that I'll be back again
My dear, I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh my crush, I've gotta crush
I suppose that i could hold it in
But you excite my every cell
Sources say that senses are your friends
My senses say that I should tell
You that I'm not ashamed
You might just feel the same
But you have to try it
If you're ever really gunna know
My dear, I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh my crush, ive gotta crush
I want to
I need to
I have to have you
You're so much to touch
Girl, you're too much
And I cant control it- you've got me all over the road
My dear, I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh my crush
Damaging my soul
You blew me off, but I dont mind
I just get better with time
And so do you
So do you
So do you
My crush



hey hey, I'm out on the road
got no worries
get in the car and roll

Hey hey, I'm headin' way down south
hey hey, yeah, I'm headin' way down south
well I hear that Cajun music
really makes you jump and shout

Hey hey, I'm out on the road
hey hey, yeah, I'm out on the road
got no worries
get on the bus and roll



It's the bleak street, weak-kneed partings I recall
It's the mistier mist
The hazier days
The brighter sun
And the easier lays
And there's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
It's the unending pleadings to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years
It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason for living or dying
When you're young and your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
And half of the time
We'd broaden our minds
More in the poolhall than we did in the schoolhall
With the downtown chewing gum bums
Watching the night life, the lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a small town boy
It ain't easy at all

Thinking it right, doing it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast, I guess

I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Jimi Hendrix, he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror
Now, who else do I like?



One more late afternoon
Once more you're out in the wind
And once more you come in too soon

It's a long road, oh man
And it's a hard road
You wanna make sure to make all the friends that you can make
You ain't worth much more to them
Than the worth of what you give
And the worth of what you take

In this old ritual of compassion
Well, you just fail and fall behind
Now you're running
Seems to be running
You're running out of time

You know it ain't love
No, you know it ain't love
Unless it's eating you alive
When you're in your bed at night

No, you know it ain't love
You know there can't be no love
Unless it comes howlin' out of you
Then you know the time is right

Ah you wait so long
And now you don't know
Now you don't know what to do
Except to pray for your love
To come returning on back to you

You dry out with all of this bitterness and fear
And with every passing year
Nothing's really real to you
Except this pain that you feel

You will come to realize
That you had your day
Someday oh so long ago
When somebody came a-calling at your door
And you pretend that you were not home

Now you're running
You're running
You're running out of time



You really did it this time you did
Did you count your fingers after shaking my hand
God forbid
Riff raff crawling from the slums
Right there in front of all your chums
I swear by the pricking of my thumbs
I'll make your day and melt away

I'll crawl back under my stone
I'll crawl back under my stone
I'll crawl back under my stone
But you won't have to stand next to me
You won't have to introduce me
You won't have to think about, talk about, care about, me
I'll crawl back

I've got a nerve just showing my face don't you think
Scruffy little likes ought to know their place don't you think
Old boy, sorry to intrude
Damn shame pretty bloody rude
I should be horsewhipped and sued
Then I'll go quietly my tail between my knees

I'll crawl back under my stone
I'll crawl back under my stone
I'll crawl back under my stone
But you won't have to stand next to me
You won't have to introduce me
You won't have to think about, talk about, care about, me
I'll crawl back

I want to be middle class
Floors and ceilings made of glass
I just want to be, I just want to be free

You had me in a second you had it all reckoned, you did
You guessed my game and my name, rank and number, you did
Somehow I gave myself away
Some code, some word I didn't say
I missed one line in the play
And the trap shut tight and you did me all right

I'll crawl back under my stone
I'll crawl back under my stone
I'll crawl back under my stone
But you won't have to stand next to me
You won't have to introduce me
You won't have to think about, talk about, care about
You won't have to ask about, fuss about, discuss about
You won't have to mind about, swear about, forget about, me
Crawl back
I'll crawl back
I'll crawl back
Crawl back

I'll crawl back
Crawl back
Crawl back
I'll crawl back



Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet take a look at yourself
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody oooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard he works hard everyday of my life
I work 'till I ache my bones
At the end at the end of the day
I take home goes home my hard earned pay all on my own goes home on his own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray praise the Lord
'Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody oooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

He works hard
Every day - I try and I try and I try -
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe

Oh Lord
Somebody somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm OK, I'm alright
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

Somebody somebody somebody somebody somebody
Find me somebody find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me find me find me
Find me somebody to love
Somebody to love
Find me somebody to love...



From the lips of so many memories
Sun, breaks the cool
Are you lost without a clue?

Stars still shine, winds will howl
All my friends sense you now
Now, strange, so very strange

Ooh, yeah, on my mind, all my talk
From the lips of so many memories
Sun, breaks the cool
Are you lost without the clue?

Remain devided, we had our day
The help provided the sad display

Hello, hello, hello, I saw you once before
In my dreams you've come to call
You are my friend, you are my friend
You touch my soul, ooh, ooh
You touch my soul, whoo
Hello, hello, hello

Ooh, hello, hello, hello
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
So strange, so very strange, now

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Oh-ho-hoo, come on, ooh yeah
Mmm, ooh yeah, eh
You are my friend, you are my friend
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh



Let's lay it on the line
All the things were missin'
Look I just came back to town
Drink that green dragon down
It's time for me to talk and you to listen
I know my heart, I know it well
Bet your analyst forgot to ask that question
We're at the start and time will tell

Till the end
Your name will touch my lips like prayin'
Till the end
I'll be the keeper of the words your heart is sayin'
Till the end
You and I will learn a language new and unspoken
Till the end
We'll be the ones who hold the key to a lock that's open

Girl not so long ago
A boy that didn't know
That he was hurtin'
Pushed somebody down
They fell and hit the ground
But i never meant for you to be that person
You know my heart, you know me well
It's never been my style to take advantage
We're at the start and time will tell



We're traveling deep inside
You face your real emotions
To get through to the other side

I wonder now how you survive
With all these feelings that you always hide

Tell me just a reason, I won't run away
We don't look back for yesterday

Right here and right now,
There's no way out we're talking soul to soul
Right here and right now,
We're standing face to face
Take me by the hand and we're flying
Until the end of time
Cuz right here and right now,
We're talking soul to soul

There aint no pill for cure
It's the devil that your' fighting for
You're waiting for release
But it aint easy to live in peace

You can't start a fire without a spark
Waiting for light in the dark

Right here and right now,
There's no way out we're talking soul to soul
Right here and right now,
We're standing face to face
Take me by the hand and we're flying
Until the end of time
Cuz right here and right now,
We're talking soul to soul

Do you believe in more than just words?
Do you believe in heart and soul?
You see the sun is shining
By the moment you decide to see it again
See it again, just see it again.

Right here and right now,
There's no way out we're talking soul to soul
Right here and right now,
Don't break my heart again….

Right here and right now,
There's no way out we're talking soul to soul
Right here and right now,
We're standing face to face
Take me by the hand and we're flying
Until the end of time
Cuz right here and right now,
We're talking soul to soul

You and I let us fly
You and I going flying
To the end of the world, to the end of the world
Right here and right now….



And nobody knows
Still got a smile for awhile
I can't let it show
Dry my tears, hide my fears

And when I'm backstage feeling down
And the lights come on
No time to worry
Gotta hurry, gotta sing my song
Gotta shake it off, and strike a pose
Here I go

Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want, just 'cause I want it

I'm super cool, super hot
Livin' like a rock star
You think I'm super
You think I'm super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super super, I'm super duper
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems
To be super super, to be super super girl

When I walk in the room
Everybody stops
Cameras Flashing, people fighting
For the best shot
They like my hair, the clothes I wear
Everybody wants to know what I'm doing next
Sometimes I wish I could stay home
Just be by myself
I wanna be more carefree
Can't you see
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want, just 'cause I want it

I'm super cool, super hot
Livin' like a rock star
You think I'm super
You think I'm super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super super, I'm super duper
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems
To be super super, to be super super girl

Wish you could see
I'm like everybody else
Struggling to let go
And always be myself

I'm super cool, super hot
Super, I'm super super, super super

On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super super, I'm super super
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems

To be super super, to be super super girl.



Love won't stop 
If you can see your dreams 
Will they stand up 
If you say you're an angel 
Then I am not 

You say everything I wanted was unclean 
My heart is aching but it's the best it's ever been 

Born with feet 
Born on the ground 
Born with everything that ties me down 
If you think you're the saviour then look around 

Made of dreams 
Made of stone 
Made from everything that's not my own 
If you think you're an angel 
Then I am not 

You say everything I wanted was unclean 
My heart is aching but it's the best it's ever been 
And you say everything I thought was obscene 
My arms are waiting to bring you back to me 

You say everything I wanted was unclean 
My heart is aching but it's the best it's ever been 
And you say everything I thought was obscene 
My arms are waiting to bring you back to me 
To bring you back to me... 
Bring you back to me...



I come to this world so wild and free
Here I am, So young and strong
Right here in the place where I belong

It's a new world
It's a new start
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
It's a new day, In a new land
And it's waiting for me
Here I am

Oh

It's a new world, It's a new start
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
Ya, It's a new day, In a new land
And it's waiting for me
Here I am





And wouldn't you love to love her
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover...

All your life you've never seen
A woman--taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win...

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark--
And when the sky is starless--

All your life you've never seen--
A woman--taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win...  will you ever win

Rhiannon x4

she rings like a bell thru the night
And wouldn't you love to love her
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover...

All your life you've never seen--
A woman--taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win...  will you ever win

Rhiannon x4

Taken by, taken by the sky x3

Dreams unwind.
Love's a state of mind. x2



Down another road I have paved 
With every good intention I saved 
And hearts that I broke 

As for me, I got scars 
For every mile I've traveled so far 
And some blood on my hands 
Here I am 

One, two, three, four

With a song in my heart 
And an attitude from the start 
I took everybody apart 
To see how they work 

I got friends that I owe 
I ain't naming names 'cause they know 
Where they stand 
Here I am 

Yeah, here I am 
Here I am 
Here I am 

If I went back where I've been 
And I knew what I know now then 
Well, I'd probably do it again 
'Cause I'm just a man 

At the end of the day 
I ain't got nothing to say 
But here I am 
Here I am 
Here I am 

Yeah, here I am 
Here I am 
Here I am



The one with the knee up hotter than hell
Aww yeah at the bar as they all stop and stare
But what they have to say no she really doesn't care

She let's them know yeah she makes it clear
Drunk talk and bullshit isn't why she's here
Chewing bubblegum and drinking beer
Aww yeah she's the one
That's right now 

Bubblegum and beer bubblegum and beer
Bubblegum and beer bubblegum and beer

Well I'm a big proud papa on the stage
And I ain't never gonna act my age
If I ever did I'd be digging me a grave
To shovel all the money in that I didn't save

I'll let ya know yeah I'll make it clear
That popularity and profit isn't why I'm here
Chewing bubblegum and drinking beer
Aww yeah I'm the one that's right now

Bubblegum and beer bubblegum and beer
Bubblegum and beer bubblegum and beer

Alright let's go

Yeah we get it on we hit it up we take the beat
Yeah we're rollin with rocket and we're right along with zeke
Hey we don't play it straight but we never really cheat
Just a Cinderella story of two twisted ass freaks

We let you know yeah we make it clear
When you see one of us the other one is near
Chewin bubblegum and drinking beer
Oh yeah were the ones
That's right now

Bubblegum and beer bubblegum and beer
Bubblegum and beer bubblegum and beer



If the earth could find my feet
I would run away and go where I know

But you don't even care
No you don't even care
What's fair

Not standing alone
Not standing around
While they sit there and wait until I lose my ground
Not letting it go
Won't leave it behind
Won't let it pass me by no not this time
Not standing alone
Not standing around
Not letting it go
Won't leave it behind

I keep so far
I nearly lost my mind
I held on so tight
And now I see that I was blind

But you don't even care
No you don't even care
What's fair

Not standing alone
Not standing around
While they sit there and wait until I lose my ground
Not letting it go
Won't leave it behind
Won't pass me by no not this time

Not standing alone
Not standing around
Not letting it go
Won't leave it behind

I have a party
I have a song
Don't need nobody, ain't nothing wrong
I hear the talk
I hear the cry
I'm on the inside and looking out
Hey

Not standing alone
Not standing around
While they sit there and wait until I lose my ground
Not letting it go
Won't leave it behind
Won't pass me by no not this time

Not standing alone
Not standing around
Not letting it go
Won't leave it behind

Not standing around no no no
Not standing around no no no
Not standing around no no no
Not standing around no no 

Not standing around 
Not standing around
Not standing around no no no



Wish for a different life.
We'll say familiar words?
And feel the weight of time.

Lay your body, down to rest.
And blow the candles out
Wish for a different life.
Keep on crawlin'.

Here's to another year
That came and passed on by.
And let you drown in fear
Because your wings wouldn't fly.

It's closing fast, It's closing fast.
Here's to another year
And to the same old fear.

But you were my sunshine.
You are my sunshine.
You are my sunshine, it's so good to see you.

Keep on crawlin'.
Keep on crawlin'.

Blow the candles out
Wish for a different life.
I'll blow the candles out
Wish for a different life.

But you are my sunshine.
You are my sunshine.
You are my sunshine, it's so good to see you.

You make it alright
Cause you are my sunshine.
You are my sunshine, it's so good to see you.

Keep on crawlin'.
Keep on crawlin'.



She's hot like Texas heat
Salem has its mysteries
But she'll knock you right to your knees

She's got it all and then some more
Like a crystal ball my dreams she hung
Madison streets I'm always lost
Reno and Vegas I wondered how she'd be

'Cause she told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more
Told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more

Told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more
Told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more

Well she'll squeeze you out Chicago style
Warm you on that magic mile
Kill no time, only doubt
Said alphabet she's in her count

She's more than a Maui smile
In Tokyo she sets the style
She's natural as Central Park
But uptown she'll break your heart in two

'Cause she told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more
Told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more

Told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more
Told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more

Well I traveled far, I traveled wide
I'd kill to keep her satisfied
Every town has its magic spot
She's got it all money could buy

She rocks like Bourbon Street
She's hot like Texas heat
Like Madison street, I'm always lost
Need her badly I wanna talk in sleep

'Cause she told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more
Told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more

Told me, told me
I won't be lonely no more
Told me, told me
She ain't never leavin' no more

C'mon, yeah



Can't recall the night before
Oh - another day

Outside it's cold and damp
Unemployment cheque is spent
Yeah - another day

Some people never know
You can't just let it go
Or try and work it out some other way
Some people never learn
My life ain't their concern
And nothin's gonna change come what may

Had a job but it fell through
Landlord says the rent is due
Oh - another day

They say the best in life is free
But if you don't pay then you don't eat
Oh - another day

I guess I'll never know
You can't just let it go
Or try to work it out some other way

Some people never learn
Their life ain't my concern
Ain't nothin' gonna change come what may

Grass looks greener on the other side
But I can't get there my hands are tied
And if I do don't be surprised
Oh - gotta figure it out another day



Is it everything you hope for.
Love, is it more than the word that you use when you look at her.
Love, it will push you around.
It will make you a poor man.
Change your picture of heaven, heaven.
Love, it will make you a man.
It will make you a child again.
Love, does it keep you awake.
Does it change everything you see.
Love, is it worth what you give.
Is it everything you need.
Love. Love, is it all that you want.
Is it everything you've worked for.
Love, is it wearing you down...love.



Cruising along got my sunroof back and I'm thinking about the day
She said she loved me late last night in a very special way

Just carry on, go along
Carry on now, going strong
Carry on now

Come on mama, gonna show you the stars, show you the universe
We're gonna play some cosmic games and I promise you won't get hurt
She's gonna see me at my best, see me at my worst

Just carry on, go along
Carry on now, going strong
Carry on now

It's a magical wheel that you try to conceal
Proving for real that's she's back in the brain, an illusion
But the words that come out are just "frustrate" and "doubt"
A definite cloud and a stop in the solution

Come on mama, gonna show you the stars, show you the universe
We're gonna play some cosmic games and I promise you won't get hurt
She's gonna see me at my best, see me at my worst

Just carry on, go along
Carry on now, going strong
Carry on now



When they were down on their luck and still high from a street fight

Told it like it wasn't really much of a big thing
To be out on the tiles and barely breathing
We were barely breathing

Showing up at shows like you care about the scene still
But where were you when the blood spilled
And they almost killed me?

It got pretty sketchy
We tried to push forward
Now we're pointing at the scoreboard and it feels so amazing
And the crowd's going crazy

Summer '88 was all heat and intensity
Saw the Youth Of Today at 7th street Entry
There were skins in the pit and some of them tried to kill me

Same club next summer and now they're called Shelter
And after the show I spoke with the singer
And he tried to hand me a pamphlet about Hare Krishna

I said you gotta be kidding
Who the hell is the blue guy?
But then he said something special
Using only his eyes, using only his eyes

The kids are all distracted
No one wins at violent shows
The kids are a distraction
No one wins at violent shows

The kids are all distracted
No one wins at violent shows
The kids are a distraction
No one wins at violent shows

The kids are all distracted
No one wins at violent shows
The kids are a distraction
No one wins at violent shows



And rest your eyes
Sleep will come, and bring the night
Oh no

I dream of silver spoons
I dream of lying, next to you
I dream that when I, wake
That you'll be there lying next to me
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

Beneath the covers
It feels like home
The nights get cold, when your all alone
Oh no

I dream of silver spoons
I dream of lying, next to you
I dream that when I, wake
That you'll be there lying next to me

And everything's okay
There's no more pennies to save
No more midnight pain

And everything's okay
There's no more pennies to save
No more midnight pain

And everything's okay
There's no more pennies to save
No more midnight pain

And everything's okay
There's no more pennies to save
No more midnight pain

And everything's okay
There's no more pennies to save
No more midnight pain

And everything's okay
There's no more pennies to save
No more midnight pain

And everything's okay
There's no more pennies to save
No more midnight pain



Is trying to get his head down for a kip 
But no sooner is it down 
And then it's on with dressing gown 
For this city very rarely loses grip 

But I have a friend who's never up by 10.00 
He's fast asleep with mouth open wide 
He's lost a lot of jobs, but he's won a lot of friends 
And he says to me, he cannot tell the time 

It's 7.00am and we're coughing up the phlegm 
Spitting out the taste of night before 
And we'll vomit and we'll choke 
Just to climb their tatty rope 
Well this city has its charm, and its claw 

And he'll blame his clock 
Or he'll say he's lost his socks 
And they'll tell you that he's been bitten by a snake 
His excuses are an art 
From the bottom of his heart 
And he thinks of them whenever he awakes 

It's 8.00am we're on the road again 
Racing for a placing at the top 
And it says green for go 
For the people in the know 
But for the others all it says is red for stop 

It's cold and its damp 
And they've dug him a grave 
And the 10.15 merchants still in bed 
And scrawled upon the headboard 
For the whole wide world to see 
"Died In The Arms Of Big Ted"



A sound so strong - that calls my name
It's wild like the river - it 's warm like the sun
Ya it's here - this is where I belong

Under the starry skies - where eagles have flown
This place is paradise - it 's the place I call home
The moon on the mountains
The whisper through the trees
The waves on the water
Let nothing come between this and me

Cuz everything I want - is everything that's here
And when we're all together - there's nothing to fear

And wherever I wander - the one thing I've learned
It's to here - I will always...always return



I wanna be with you everyday, hey
Cause I've got a feeling that's beginning to grow
And there's only one thing I can say yeah

I'm ready - to love you
I'm ready - to hold you, don't you know
I'm ready - to love you
I'm ready - I'm ready
As ready as I'm gonna be, ooh yeah

She left me a long note when she left me here
Told me that love was hard to find yeah
But baby it's easy and I'll make it clear, ooh yeah
That there's only one thing on my mind, oh yeah

I'm ready - to love you
I'm ready - to hold you, don't you know
I'm ready - to love you
I'm ready - I'm ready
As ready as I'm gonna be, oh yeah

Yeah, I'm ready - to love you, oh yeah
I'm ready - to hold you, don't you know
I'm ready - to love you yeah
I'm ready - to hold you, girl don't you know
I'm ready - to love you, come on now
I'm ready - to hold you, yeah
I'm ready - to love you, sweet babe
I'm ready - to hold you, I'm ready, ready
I'm ready - to love you
I'm ready - to hold you



Yes, I'm a greedy man
Said, I'm a greedy man, people

Yes, I'm a greedy man
Greedy man, greedy man
Tryin' to do the best I can

I want me a real cool woman
A brand new car, a big bankroll
And be a movie star
I'm a greedy man

Yes, I'm a greedy man
Greedy man, greedy man
Tryin' to do the best I can

Looky here, I want me two Cadillacs
Paint 'em both red
Two chickens in my pot
Two womens in my bed

Yeah, I'm a greedy man
Greedy man, greedy man
Tryin' to do the best I can, yeah

I want a woman to rub my back

Greedy man, greedy man
Tryin' to do the best I can

Greedy man, greedy man
Tryin' to do the best I can
I'm a greedy man



The sweat is building up
It always fails to amaze me
The ignorance erupts

Sandpaper grinding down
Turned my ego to a frown

Swimming in December
It's snowing in July
I'm trying to remember
I've forgotten how the thorn got in my side

Kick me in the stomach
It's supposed to be that way
Thank you for another
Can I have some more today?

No encouragement, no shot
No "I'm sorry" - Thanks a lot!
"Just be glad for what you've got."

Eleven years of wonder
I never figured out
The one who knows the score
But I'm not playing anymore



Mr. Manson makes the Four look fab
'Cause death and evil is what sells today
And Walter Disney's spinnin' in his grave.

Grandpa's Woodstock acid wasn't brown
President lit up and passed it down
The days of outrage have all gone away
I bet that Disney's spinnin' in his grave.

Remember back to days when
Kids were kids and it was fun
And the kids didn't carry guns
While we were pleasure hunting
We got tricked like Elmer Fudd
Brainwashed by the media.

Inconvenienced by a small mistake
Mother chooses to exterminate
I wonder what the forefathers would say
The land of the free, home of the depraved
I bet that Disney's spinnin' round
I bet that Disney's spinnin'
I bet that Disney's spinnin' in his grave.



What was on the other side 
Of the flowing blue curtain?
You're most alive before you died.
If we cry underwater,
We can hide the suffering
Then go rejoice in life's splendor, 
'Cause death awaits like an old friend. 

So do you dance with the whirling wind? 
Becoming the voice of the ring up in the air.
Do you dance with the whirling wind? 
Becoming the voice of the ring beyond earth's atmosphere

I'm here to tell you something's lurking from another side
For I am longing to see us in our true nature.
So where are you when all the mirrors of this world have shattered?
Well tonight it seems though maybe things will go unheard. 

Now there's an unheard presence 
That screams about our aliveness.
'Cause now the night is split and bleeds.
What did it take to be set free? 
A bullet into faceless nights. 
it seems there's no place to confide. 
I think I see myself in you.
Somewhere below they hide the truth. 

We need to believe in something
'Cause everyone seems to be dying to be set free.

I'm here to tell you something's lurking from another side
For I am longing to see us in our true nature
So where are you when all the mirrors of this world have shattered?
Well tonight it seems though maybe things will go unheard. 

In life until they die 
So unheard in life until they until they die! 

mumbling

I'm here to tell you something's lurking from another side.
For I am longing to see us in our true nature
So where are you when all the mirrors of this world have shattered?
Well tonight it seems though maybe things will go unheard. 

Unheard in life, until they die 
So unheard in life
Until they, until they die!



Had me in your sights
I've got news for you
I'm working over time
To get away from slander
To stay away from lies
I won't listen to you criticize


Get on, get on get away from me
If you're trying to bring me down
If you're trying to bring me down
Get on, get on get away from me
If you're trying to bring me down
If you're trying to bring me down

I've been doin some thinking
And I think you're wrong
For trying to put down
What I've been working on
So if you want to break me
You better stay away
I won't listen, no
I won't listen to you today

Excuse me if i still question
Carefully all of your intentions
I've decided that I won't listen
Because your words only bring division




I will find you
In your desperate hour.

Patients, don't you lose hope.
There is freedom
From these complications.

The water's risin' up
And you see it
And you feel it pullin'.
So hold on, don't you worry.
I will find you
In your desperate hour.

For if this world should end tonight
I'll be by your side.
Would you feel you had lived your life
Or wasted all your time?

Listen, it's your weak hand
That deceives you
And your plans to make it.

Remember, let a strong hand
Help to lead you
In your desperate hour.

The whole room starts to spin
When the lights go out, the lights go out.
So listen, let a strong hand
Help to lead you
In your desperate hour.

For if this world should end tonight
I'll be by your side.
Would you feel you had lived your life
Or wasted all your time?

All your reservations
Turn to complications.
And the situations
Go on, and on, and on, and on.

For if this world should end tonight
I'll be by your side.
Would you feel you had lived your life
Or wasted all your time?

All your reservations
Turn to complications.
And the situations
Go on, and on, and on, and on.



We could go for a ride
We'll keep the windows rolled down low
And I'll let ya drive
Let's head downtown
Let's get up, go for a walk
Because the weather sounds just right
We oughta float

Something's coming up in her garden
She's been talking that flower jargon
Look at all the pretty color
Lift your window
She oughta get up, but she won't go
'Cause we're sitting up in her garden
Pickin' up on her flower jargon
Look at all the pretty colors, it's a freak show
We oughta let up, but we won't go home
No, we won't

Must we get back to find it's all been delayed
Just like the winter's fickle snow
It all melts away, hey, hey
Relief, we've still got
We've got these summers ahead
Caught with the windows down, you know
Gonna stick out our heads
We sing it



Crush these empires to ashes and make them wonder.

Just look out of your window and you'll find us here,
We can make a stand to stop the uproars,
If you can fight in wars for that.

Crush these empires to ashes and make them wonder.

If you could give us the answers now.

Help us to end all the suffering,
We'll clean the blood from all of our eyes,
Take the rage away from us.

If you could give us the answers now.

We could crush these empires to ashes and make them wonder.

I hope that in time that I'm okay with all of this. X2

Don't you make me cry.

Crush.



Wake up every morning to the sound of the radio screaming 
6:30, 7:30, 8 o'clock and I got to leave 
Walk out on the street with nothing on except the shame of last night 
And a number in my hand of a man I don't even know 


Where do I fit in 
Where is my place here 
What do I need to say, what do you want to hear 
Where do I fit in 
If she's in your bed 
Where is my beautiful 

Late night, long day, doesn't make much difference to me anyway 
You called, I answered, but baby I'm only half awake 
Hush little one with you here everything's going to be okay 
Is all you say but what if things don't go that way 


It's over, we both know, we're both tired of playing the parts 
I said goodbye, you said oh well nothing's really lost 
Call every now and than just to hear your voice talk to me 
You still say everything's alright but it's not and that's something you're too blind to see 



Where do I fit in 
Where is my place here 
If there's nothing for me to say, there's nothing you want to hear 
Where do I fit in 
If she's in your bed 
Where is my beautiful 
Where do I fit in 
If she's in your bed 
Where is my beautiful



Late news breaking this just in
Yeah, coolin' out
Yeah, coolin' out
Yeah, coolin' out

God sure baked a lot of fruitcake, baby
When Adam met the Eden lady
They're walking the streets and they're driving cars
They're all over the country and they're running ours
They're walking on the wounded who won the war
What's the matter people - was it worth fighting for
Coolin' out

Fix that gauge or you run out of gas
A cool operator can make it last
Say, from here to Indiana and across Illinois
We're rockin the girls and a-boppin' on the boys
And I spot a little bitty on a little bam-bam
That pill poppers hopping on a city bound tram

The stars go in and the stars go out
And punk rock what it's all about
And even when you're ch-ch-ch-ch-chillin' out
You're wondering what's it all about
Coolin' out, coolin' out, coolin' out

At the G7 summit, well we've got some 25
And we're putting it into the gin supply
We want a satellite crashing outta the skies
And a firework display by ballistic missiles
I got a sneeky feeling that the poker's getting hot
Cos twice times bitten and it's third time shot, third time shot

Oh, the stars go in and the stars go out
And punk rock what it's all about
And even when you're ch-ch-ch-ch-chillin' out
You're wondering what's it all about
Coolin'
What's it all about
Let somebody else figure it out

What's it all about, what's it all about
The stars go in and the stars go out
Punk rock what it's all about
And even when you're ch-ch-ch-ch-chillin' out
Wondering what's it all about, what's it all about
What's it all about



Your faded smile
The air
What's to it?

I try to shake it off all evening
I try to pass just out of reach
To reach conclusions that can't be concluded
A hotline to the past, that's all it is

I was anxious
I was sure you'd come to see the show
And what's more
I was hoping you would appreciate it

It's electrified at first, yes
But then it drops
It's a box of many flavors
But we are not enough, is that not so?
Not sure, just wont have it

Get your mind off what you leave behind
You know you may as well be going blind lately
It's hard to say, you know
Well, you've been led astray
This simply will not do
And it's true it hurts me too

Well I guess it's not so long ago
I turned to speak and there was no-one
Nothing, just a street car rolling by

Now, nothing in here really moves
I just produce a bunch of silly lies
And all those brightly colored lights
Ah but I have loved you in my way
I have loved you
Too much too fast
And then a little
A little too late

Get your mind off what you leave behind
You know you may as well be going blind lately
It's hard to say, you know
Well, you've been led astray
This simply will not do
And it's true it hurts me too

You've been led astray
For what reason I can't say
I won't stand in your way again

It's been another ...
As such is that ... and I reach through your window
Wake you in the morning

I was waiting
I was sure you'd get whatever you were waiting for
But I can't stand it anymore

Get your mind off what you leave behind
You know you may as well be going blind lately
It's hard to say, you know
Well, you've been led astray
This simply will not do
And it's true it hurts me too



That we'll put up?
Am I losing touch,
Should I give up?

Lost at sea
Memories
Swim until I hit
Or can't get up

I'm waiting for a miracle
Every day, when I wake
I'm praying for a miracle
Every day, to come my way

Dancing in the sky
With the moonlight
I'm a silhouette
For a moment's time

Twenty-five
Is this my life?
Blue house, a wife
On my mind

I'm waiting for a miracle
Every day, when I wake

I'm praying for a miracle
Every day, to come my way

Looking for an answer
That might not ever come
So, I'm praying for a miracle
To come and pick me up.

A miracle
A miracle

I'm waiting for a miracle
Every day, when I wake
I'm praying for a miracle
Every day, to come my way

Looking for an answer
That might not ever come
So, I'm praying for a miracle
To come and pick me up

Y-eah -ah.
Y-eah



Searching for the great ideal
But the human race wears an ugly face
And cosmetics wash off in the rain

I'm thinking of the night that my heart took flight
Only to come crashing down
And I had just enough eyes left to see you leave
Orbital? through the door

Revenge! I watched you go
Revenge! The rest I know
Revenge! The true blood's plain
Revenge! I fell insane

I'm thinking of myself and I find it strange
To know that you are really mine
But I think of your past like broken glass
The pieces who are people I still meet

And everywhere we go, it seems,
They call you by your name
They greet you with a little kiss
And say they're glad you came

Revenge! It makes me ill
Revenge! If only looks could kill
Revenge! The word's your friend
Revenge! Oh it really is?

And this is how I'm feeling now
Angered and dissolved
And this is how this song will end
Somewhat unresolved



My body is tired
I focus on wrong things
Ces yeux incompetant
I won't believe their lies
They're too hungry with pride

My needful face gave me away
I wanna know what I've done wrong
My needful face gave me away
I wanna know what I've done wrong
I wanna know so I can change

A rose in an empty bottle
Now I have a wife
A rose of my own
See that I am my father's son
I may make mistakes but I learn
I learn through faith

My needful face gave me away
I wanna know what I've done wrong
My needful face gave me away
I wanna know what I've done wrong
I wanna know so I can change

Accomplishments don't mean a thing
They don't mean a thing
They don't
You never had to earn respect from me
You've had it all along

My needful face gave me away
I wanna know what I've done wrong
My needful face gave me away
I wanna know what I've done wrong
I wanna know so I can change

I could write this song in anger
But it's not who I am
It's not



Dead of night, underway
All your days, pass you by
Sun will rise, on your lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights

Pray you sleep tonight
Pray just a little
When every little thing
Starts fallin' to pieces

Take my hand, fall in place
Soul inside, oh it shows in every line that's on your face

Stay with me tonight
Stay I'm gonna need ya when
Every little thing
Starts fallin' to pieces

Ya been around town, take it down now
Why is it the ones you love, that makes it all so hard on you
Then you let it fall behind, and in the back of your mind
You feel my loving shine, you think you might be saved

Tell me that you want someone beside you
Tell me that you want to see this through
Tell me all the times that I've been loving you
Oh you love me, love me, love me too

Stay with me tonight
Stay I'm gonna need ya when every little thing
Starts fallin' to pieces
Pray just a little when every little thing
Starts fallin' to pieces

Every little thing
Starts fallin' to pieces

Every little thing
Starts fallin' to pieces

Every little thing
Starts fallin' to pieces



Come in close so everyone can see 
I got a tale to tell, a listen don't cost a dime 
And if you believe that, we're gonna get along just fine 

Now I've been travelin' all around 
I heard trouble's come to your town 
Well I've got a little somethin' guaranteed to ease your mind 
It's call snake oil y'all, it's been around for a long, long time 

Say your crops'll burn if it don't rain soon 
Ain't seen a drop since the tenth of June 
Well I can open up the sky, people have no fear 
If you ain't impressed yet, just tell me what you wanna hear 

Well you lost your farm, so you moved to town 
You get a job, they shut the factory down 
Now you sit around all day long feelin' sad and blue 
You need snake oil y'all, tell you what I'm gonna do 

I can heal the sick, I can mend the lame 
And the blind shall see again, it's all the same 

Well ain't your President good to you 
Knocked 'em dead in Libya, Grenada, too 
Now he's taking his show a little further down the line 
Well, 'tween me and him people, you're gonna get along just fine



It's a brand new world's deep sound,
Sleeping under these remains.
And I guess I could be wrong,
Time ago all hope was gone,
Moving lips to breathe that time.

No murder by the light of sun,
I've only come to see it shine.
Please let me take a bite of cloud,
Time for romantic view.

In the halflight were I stand,
Roma rises from the pink,
It's a slice of light that brings me hope.
Moving lips to breathe warm joy,
Silent wishful noise,
Though the dust red buildings kiss the sky.

And I know it's time to run,
To forgive the burning rain,
"Twist your head in wind", yeah, someone says.
And I try to organize,
All the tears I cried,
I have lived and mourned for aftermath.

Aftercare day,
Aftergame time.
Afterward cry,
Grey hairs on my head.
See, the time of youth is gone,
See, the rage of past is vain.
Try to close your eyes and smile,
Sleeping under these remains.



here come the brights lights
here come the good times
I got on my suit of lights
I got on my suit of lights
they'll be dancing and good times in those rafters
well you took off your rings
your make up at this time
here's no debts to pay we'll save the lion
there comes your gold
there comes your star
stay in your room of lights
with your ornaments
stay in your room of lights
in these honeyed times
stay in your room of lights
stay in your room of lights
stay in your room of lights
in your room of lights
in your room of lights
make it right
in your room of lights

sew the button back on my jacket
lay down in the room of ligths
pick her blue dress up off the floor
she draws animals up on the wall
the she reached down, reached down the well
take your pictures down of the wall
put your rings into the draw
pick your crayons up off the floor
tread the carpet, roll the carpet down the hall
our friend she can't be here with us today
she's gone away
she's gone away
oh she's the diamonds that built the castle
she's the rocks that built the shack
she's the diamonds that built the castle
our friend she can't be here with us today
she's gone away
she's gone away
she's gone away
make it winter time
in-in-in her room of lights
in-in-in her room of lights
oh back and forth in winter-time
oh back and forth in winter-time
in her room of lights
in her room of lights



I wanna tell you just how I feel 
I will show you 
I will show you my love is real 

Nobody's ever gonna love you like I am 
You never can deny that 
Nobody's ever gonna hold you like I am 
I'll love you 'til I die 


Until the day I die 

I said "forever" 
I said "forever" and I mean it 
I made a promise 
And I intend to always keep it 

Forever is so far beyond the reach of my mind 
So I'll give all I have, my heart, my love, my life



Don't do all the talking, let love speak up itself 
Let love speak up itself 

So when you feel a little tatty and unhappy with your face 
Let it breathe into us and put you back in place 
Let it breathe, let it breathe 
From the day it came into us till the day it wants to leave 
For it will, it will go 
And it will not say goodbye just like it didn't say hello 
There will not be a send-off, a funeral or mass 
Just a pathetic little vodka from a dirty little glass 
'To the world's greatest mum 
From the oldest swinger in town' 

Let love speak up itself 
Let love speak up itself 
Let it rise up in the morning and take us for that walk 
Let it do the talking when we're too tired to talk 
When we're too tired to talk 

And when you feel unhappy that I'm not the one I was 
Let love rot inside and let love palm you off 
Let it rot, let it rot 
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot 
In a knot, in a knot 
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot 
Hang them from a cleaver and say 'Look what we've got 
A man and a woman and guess what they forgot' 
'To the world's greatest mum 
From the oldest swinger in town' 

Let love speak up itself



Black skin universe
One more travelin' man
With weary tired eyes
Feeling cold, feeling cold
Thinking around the clock of
Drinking on the job
Of the powdered food and piss bags
Never having sex
And growing old, growing old

Headspace, alive and painless
Weightless and almost sane I
Close my eyes, I become the sky, yeah
Headspace, alone and shameless
Can't wait to find the faces
Left behind in a...a troubled time
Back home, back home
Back home, back home

It gets so lonely, you know
Weeks and months alone
Chasing sleep and space junk
And the dying stars
I've known and loved, known and loved
Through true decline of the
Five billions minds or so
Through mudslides and earthquakes
The blue one holds on
And rolls along, rolls along, rolls along

Headspace, alive and painless
Weightless and almost sane I
Close my eyes, I become the sky, yeah
Headspace, alone and shameless
Can't wait to find the faces
Left behind in a...a troubled time
Back home, back home
Back home, back home

One more astronaut in
Endless old universe with
One more second chance at
Wondering why he's here at all

Headspace, alive and painless
Weightless and almost sane I
Close my eyes, I become the sky, yeah
Headspace, alone and shameless
Can't wait to find the faces
Left behind in a...a troubled time
Back home, back home
Back home, back home

Bold are the ones who come
Over the line to fall
Over the horizon
Never ones to fade away
Then it hit me
This cosmic pull and energy
It kinda makes me wonder if
I'll ever make it back home, back home



Modelling for magazines
Nun-Chukka
Things are never quite as they seem
He's got throwing stars
He's got silver tops
Mama's grabbed her jewellery
Hidden in the bathroom
Calling the cops

Bridge
Give me somewhere to go
Don't give me train rides
When the shops are all closed
Don't give me train rides

Never gave anyone the slightest notion
Never showed us that the call was cast
Mama don't want you
Daddy don't want you
Your Motor's running way too fast

Now the Mallway's shuttered
Hanging in the afternoon
Drink a little Vodka
Picking up the old man
Rolling him 'round in her room



Head spinnin', couldn't find my way around and
Didn't know that I was goin' down, yeah, yeah
Where I've been, well, it's all a blur
What I was lookin' for, I'm not sure
Too late and didn't see it comin', yeah, yeah

And then I crashed into you and I went up in flames
Could've been the death of me
But then you breathed your breath in me
And then I crashed into you like a runaway train
You will consume me, but I can't walk away

Somehow I couldn't stop myself
I just wanted to know how it felt
Too strong I couldn't hold on, yeah, yeah
Now I'm just tryin' to make some sense
Out of how and why this happened
Where we're headed, there's just no knowin', yeah, yeah

And then I crashed into you and I went up in flames
Could've been the death of me
But then you breathed your breath in me
And then I crashed into you like a runaway train
You will consume me, but I can't walk away

From your face, your eyes are burned into me
You saved me, you gave me just what I need
Oh, just what I need

And then I crashed into you and I went up in flames
Could've been the death of me
But then you breathed your breath in me
And then I crashed into you like a runaway train
You will consume me, but I can't walk away

And then I crashed into you, and then I crashed into you 
And then I crashed into you, and then I crashed into you
And then I crashed into you like a runaway train
You will consume me, but I can't walk away



And if she scared you then she's sorry, she's been stranded at these parties
These parties they start lovely
But they get druggy and they get ugly and they get bloody

The priest just kinda laughed, the deacon caught a draft
She crashed into the Easter mass with her hair done up in broken glass
She was limping left on broken heels
When she said, "Father, can I tell your congregation how a resurrection really feels?"

Holly was a hoodrat, and now you finally know that
And she's been disappeared for years, today she finally came back
St. Louis had enslaved me, I guess Santa Ana saved me, St. Peter had me on the queue, the St. Paul saints they waved me through
I was all wrapped up in some video booth when I heard her say "I love you too"

She said I've laid beneath my lovers but I've never gotten laid
Some nights she felt protected, some nights she felt afraid
She spent half last winter just trying to get paid
From some guy she originally thought to be her savior

They wrote her name in magic marks on stop signs and subway cars
They got a mural up on East 13th that said "Hallelujah, rest in peace"
Hallelujah was a hoodrat, and now you finally know that
She's been disappeared for years, today she finally came back

Walk on back, walk on back

She said don't turn me on again
I'd probably just go and get myself all gone again
Don't turn me on again
I'll probably just go and go and get myself all gone again

So don't turn me on again
I'll probably just go and go and get myself all gone again
Hallelujah was a sexy mess, she looked strung out but experienced
So we all got kind of curious

Walk on back...



All I have lived for have faded from sight
And though I say that I can live without her
I find myself crying at night

She'll come back, oh yeah, she'll come back
She'll come back, oh yeah, she'll come back
Don't you worry my friend, she'll come back in the end

Though I try to conceal all my heart breaks
Still one can tell what I'm feeling inside
And all my friends tried to comfort and help me
Regain what is left of my pride

She'll come back, oh yeah, she'll come back
She'll come back, oh yeah, she'll come back
Don't you worry my friend she'll come back in the end



Two cups of coffee and she runs for the bus,
Looks in the window and fixes her hair,
Nobody notices and nobody cares.

She admits it ain't no kinda life,
Workin' 9 to 5 you know...

She's only happy when she's dancin',
There ain't no place she'd rather be,
When she's dancin',
Just her heart and her soul and her fantasies.

When Friday evenin' finally rolls around,
She grabs a taxi and she heads uptown,
Goes to a place they call "The Ball And Chain",
Nothin' matters until Monday so she goes insane.

Well its a bitch tryin' to make ends meet,
But that's the way the story goes...

She's only happy when she's dancin',
There ain't nothin' makes her feel so free,
When she's dancin',
The girl's outrageous and it's plain to see.

She ain't got much but she got independence,
Ya - She's doin' alright,
His eyes are on her as the evenin's endin',
But she ain't goin' for no mystery,
Because nobody rides for free.

She's only happy when she's dancin',
C'mon dance with me babe,
Dancin', - there ain't no place she'd rather be,
When she's dancin',
Just her heart and her soul and her fantasies - dancin'.



Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted teepee
Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our warlord's dead
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns

Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine

And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears

I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run

Trampling down the prairie rose leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead

Now there seems no reason why I should carry on
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns

And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole



Let in the light from my window
Say goodbye to my sorrow
And hello new day

My soul needed a rescue
A hero, it had to be You
I know You've changed everything

So I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love

I've thrown years away
And every chance to change
It took so much to see my pride

I've thrown punches in the air
Chased after love that wasn't there
I know only You satisfy

I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love

Yeah, I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love

To all the brokenhearted
The crippled and the weak
We are all invited to taste and see

To all of those who are searching
Come find what you seek
It is the truth that we all
Truth that we all need

Everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love

Yeah, I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love

Yeah, I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love

Yeah, I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love

I want to tell the world about Your love
I want to tell the world about Your love



violent shades of green
1000 voiceless faces were chasing me
I ran through the air as thick as glue
from 1000 fucking faces that all looked like you
Through night as black as hate my spirit fled
Through branches filled with thorns
my eyes bled and bled
How could I ever hope to win this race
When every time I close my eyes I see your face

It just can't happen here repeat



Years ago a future was laid before me
And I took the task and ran with it as far as I could go
I always wanted to be a part of something like this
You believed in me, and it's all I needed

Before I go, please know that I love you with all of my heart
My heart, my heart, is beating for you
I want you to know that I'll be thinking of you wherever I go

Tonight I am standing with you
A chance to change the world as we know it
The feeling of lights upon me feels so perfect
You are here with me and it's all I need

Before I go, please know that I love you with all of my heart
My heart, my heart, is beating for you
I want you to know that I'll be thinking of you wherever I go

Before I knew you, before I saw your face
Life had its reasons for keeping love away
Spring turned to summer and
summer then turned to fall
Then came September
We began it all

my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart

Before I go, please know that I love you with all of my heart
My heart, my heart, my heart
I want you to know that I'll be thinking of you wherever I go
My heart, my heart, is beating for you
My heart
Whenever I go My heart, my heart is beating for you, My heart



I can't pretend that nothing's changed any longer
I've drowned the doubts and chewed the lies
Ignored the space between the lines

Don't act so surprised
When you knew it all along
Each and every lie
Burns a hole into my soul

Then you asked me how this came to be
A quite selective memory
In what dirty river did you find
The water that would make you lose your reflection?
Heard you say we're both to blame
It's just a lame attempt to ease your pain

Don't act so surprised
When you knew it all along
Each and every lie
Burns a hole into my soul
A sky about to rain



Drag you down and pull you in and tell you nice you'll never win
Pretty good at,letting go it's the, only place you'll ever go,
Prison doors sound like, wedding bells as you, ask for change at the wishing well
I don't like this place, I don't like what it's become
You can hide your face, you can always hide your guns
Shot down, spun round, strung out
Still around somehow
In the human race, there's a space for everyone
You can save yourself, you can always kill your sons, shot down, spun
round, strung out
Still around somehow



Out goes ego on the first mistake
Out goes ego on the tide
This one's waiting for his mother's love
And up jumps mother valentinevalentine

Too many compose a shame
And I hear voices like Abraham
This is your papa wrapped up in time
This is your mama in valentines
In valentines 

This is your mama crawling back into the sackvalentine
This is your papa singing "find another dad"valentine
This is your mama singing "that's no lie"valentine
This is your papa come to send them both away

I want to sleep, I want to slide
I want to reel in the space from either side
I'm on a roll, I'm on a ride
I'm only waiting for mother valentine

Out goes ego on the first mistake
Out goes ego on the tide
This one's waiting for his mother's love
And up jumps mother valentine valentine

This is your mama crawling back into the sack valentine
This is your papa singing "find another dad" valentine
This is your mama singing "that's no lie" valentine

This is your papa come to send them both away

God bless this miracle
God bless eternity
God bless you and me



Why water fills up her eyes
Baby tell her
Theres just no reason to cry
We'll find a reason to lie to her

Maybe after the water burns up her eyes
We could tell her
Theres just no reason to try
Without repeating her lines 
Each time

This somebody makes you laugh girl
Is someone who'd make you cry still
In one day you've made your mind up
This someone is right enough- for girl

Maybe laughter
Will dry the tears that we cry
When we tell her
Theres just no pleasing this guy
He'd find a reason to lie to her

This somebody makes you laugh girl
Is someone who'd make you cry still
In one day you've made your mind up
This someone is right enough- for girl

Somebodys nodding off
She'll know it when shes ready and had enough
Someday we write it off
We know it when were ready and had enough



Anybody would of thought 
I'd have dialed 911 the way you come running 
And your right there by my side if 
You think there's the slightest problem.

What makes you think that you 
Should have to try and solve them 
Guess what im trying to say is 

Don't try be my hero 
Dont you know sometimes I 
Gotta make it on my own, on my own 
And though i may stumble and fall 
I break in and crawl
Don't try and be my 
My hero, my hero	
My hero, my hero 

I know that your just looking like 
Your trying to protect me if you would
Only took a second so you can see 
I'm capable and im strong enough 
I've got this and its not too much 
Dont need no Hercules, no superman 
So wont you please 
Take a step back and let me go 

Don't try be my hero 
Dont you know sometimes I 

Gotta make it on my own, on my own 
And though I may stumble and fall 
I break in and crawl
Don't try and be my 

You got this thing about you 
Always wanna be the one that comes through 
For me but lately i think i can do it by myself
You got this thing that you do and I cant lie its kinda cute but
Don't try don't try be Yeah!

Don't you know sometimes, sometimes I 
Gotta make it on my own, on my own 
And though i may stumble and fall 
Im break in and crawl
Don't try and be my 
My hero, my hero	
My hero, my hero

Though i may stumble and fall 
Im breaking the crawl
Don't try and be my 
My hero, my hero	
My hero, my hero

La la la la la 
Ay yeah ee yea 
Hey



I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet mother love

I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone

Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet mother love

My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet mother love



and sounds through the flames
the deafening drone
of these clanking machines 
in the lights
it's the same
we're trying to free
the sculpture from the stone
we'll take the rhythm from the throne
if the radio is dying
listen to me won't you listen to me 

I don't want to lie in a bed of ashes
I don't want to burn in a midnight sun
I don't want to know if the system crashes
I don't want to go if it's just begun
I don't want to lie in a bed of ashes
I don't want to burn in the midnight
sun 
in the midnight sun

I scream like a madman in the morning 
no one heard a thing
I had hoped for a more effective warning
no one felt the sting
someone's savior never saved 
take it away 'till there's nothing left to say
the radio is dying
listen to me
won't you listen to me

I don't want to lie in a bed of ashes
I don't want to burn in a midnight sun
i don't want to know if the system crashes
I don't want to go if it's just begun
I don't want to lie in a bed of ashes
I don't want to burn in the midnight
sun
in the midnight sun

Dancing like a child
will we feel at all 
or just smile in another pretty prison
the wires frayed and broken free
it's loud as hell but I don't want to listen
is existentialism so desperate? 
condition may seem painful but it won't last 
I just march, march
sometimes I get the last laugh

Machines and dreams
to make the choices for you
machines and dreams
I won't go out like that
machines and dreams
to make the choices for your
machines and dreams--
I won't go out

I don't want to lie in a bed of ashes
I don't want to burn in the midnight sun
I don't want to know if the system crashes
I don't want to go if it's just begun
I don't want to lie in a bed of ashes
I don't want to burn in a midnight sun
I don't want to know if the system crashes
I don't want to go i don't want to go 
I don't want to lie
I don't want to go
I don't want to lie
I don't want to go



'Til we pass out on the floor

Met a little girl with no bloomers on
When she showed me her fake I.D. I knew something was wrong
She said let's dance
Said I got a wooden leg

Said I'd like to see you on your knees
She's cuddly wuddly wuddly too
She's cuddly wuddly wuddly got a hold on you
Yeah you got a reputation for coming on strong

Now you're leanin' up against my dang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang
Here we go to your bungalow
Boyfriend's on the road

Put the spit on
Put the spit on

Get a little nervous
What can a poor boy say
'Bout a girl that fucks a different guy each and every day
But she's cuddly wuddly wuddly

Too bad
You don't dig dudes that play guitar
You got a thing for drummers
You got a thing for men with scars

Put the spit on
Put the spit on
Put the spit on

Throbbing pulsating gyrating hyperventilating 'til we pass out
On the floor

Put the spit on
Put the spit on
Put the spit on
Put the spit on

Put the spit on
Put the spit on



I don't understand it
Don't know why you went and threw it all away
Yesterday
We had it all and you threw it all away
I don't know why you couldn't stay
Yesterday

You should have believed it
You would have recived it yeah
Hello to the woken
Goodbye to all the broken
Word is spoken yeah

You couldn't have planned it
I don't understand it
Don't know why you went and threw it all away
Yesterday
We had it all and you threw it all away
I don't know why you couldn't stay
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday

Hello to the woken
Goodbye to all the broken
Word is spoken yeah
You were all wrapped up in a blizzard
Coke choked up to the gizzard
On a snowy summer day

You were all wrapped up in a blizzard
Coke choked up to the gizzard
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday



I got a couple of plam trees on each side of my cheek
And it's a bright blue Saturday
And the rummage sells the rubbish to me

But if I could buy the sky that's hangin'
Over this bed of mine
If I could climb these vines
And maybe see what you're seein'

If you were standing on the corner staring straight
Into the eyes of Jesus Christ

One porch, one dog, one cockroach only way to be
I got sewage fruit and it's growing out back from roots
I don't know if they belong to me
But if I could buy the sky that's hangin'

Over this bed of mine
And if I could climb these vines
and maybe see what you're seein'

Sittin' at the edge of this building,
Twenty stories below,
A' twenty stories below
Twenty stories below
Twenty stories below

I can't tell you how many ways that I've sat,
And viewed my life today, but I can tell you
I don't think that I can find easier way
So if I see you walking hand in hand in hand
With a three armed man, you know I'll understand

But you should have been in my shoes yesterday
You should have been in my shoes yesterday



And I'm sick about all the game
You're playin' behind that door

Too much lies
Too much guys
Lonely nights
Bleedin' fights
Jealousy stay away from me

Babe, babe!
Get out, get out
Of my life
You're livin', livin'
Out of my heart
I say I
I don't want you no more

There's a man upstairs
There's a man downstairs
There's a man under the bed
& one across the street

All the friends you got
They will give you a home







Have burned out or faded away
And the so called voice of reason
Has turned out to lead you astray
We can go through the motions
Like we’ve done all along
But if you’re minds made up
I know that either way you’re gone

So say what you will
Say what you want to
It could be a lie
And it’s alright
Say what you will
Say what you need to
Cause there might not be a next time
So tell me are you ready
Are you ready
To never again say what you will

When it feels your world just sold you
I’ll be there to take you in
Your canary through the coal mine
Giving you the go ahead
We can go through the motions
You know I’ll play along
But if you try to deny me
Then you’re already gone

So say what you will
Say what you want to
It could be a lie and it’s alright
Say what you will
Say what you need to
Cause there might not be a next time
So tell me are you ready
Are you ready
To never again say what you will

Well, don’t just stand there reaching
Force your hand to meet mine
Or take that chance and leave
Cause this could be the last time
Are you ready

Say what you will
Say what you want to
It could be a lie and it’s alright
Say what you will
Say what you need to
Cause there might not be a next time
Or you can take that chance and leave
Cause this could be the last time
To never again say what you will
Never again
Say what you will



Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better baby

With every word and every breath I'm prayin'
That's why I'm sayin'

Please forgive me - I know not what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me - this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - if I need you like I do
Babe believe me - every word I say is true
Please forgive me - If I can't stop loving you
Never leave me - I don't know what I do
Please forgive me - I Can't stop loving you

Can't stop loving you



And forgot to turn off the brain machine.
So when security opened the door the next day, 
There was a plastic, brand new army.
And they were are smart as geek is chic right now, 
And as clever as the invention of pillow cases. 
And they asked the guard who had made them, 
But his knees were so shaky and he wasn't so smart.
So he shot them all dead.



Let go, it's a very hard lesson you learn

Like a blind man run down a highway
Is a very good friend of mine
And I'm runnin', I'm yellin', I'm tryin' to catch him
But I keep on fallin' behind

Let go, it's a hard, hard lesson to learn

Like a clown stuck out on a high wire
Is a very good friend of mine
Losin' his sense of balance
Reachin' a hand for mine

Let go, it's a hard, hard lesson to learn

Like the empty glass on the table
Is a very good friend of mine
Askin' me if I need one more
Starin' straight into my mind

Let go, let go, let go, let go



If I close my eyes will you still be listening to me
I feel, I know, have I lost control
I see it now, but I didn't
Where I once stood, now there's an aching hole

And I say the love we've made will always keep us two
'Cos she's a lovebird and I love her and I know she loves me too
And I say the love we've made will always keep us two
'Cos she's a lovebird and I love her and I know she loves me too

She's got those ocean blue eyes for me
It's like November in here but it's springtime inside of me
I feel, I know, have I lost control
I see it now, but I didn't
Where I once stood, now there's an aching hole

And I say the love we've made will always keep us two
'Cos she's a lovebird and I love her and I know she loves me too
And I say the love we've made will always keep us two
'Cos she's a lovebird and I love her and I know she loves me tooooo

And I say the love we've made will always keep us two
'Cos she's a lovebird and I love her and I know she loves me too
And I say the love we've made will always keep us two
'Cos she's a lovebird and I love her and I know she loves me too ooh aah



Yeah
Whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah

And the meek shall inherit the earth





We've taken care of everything, 
The words you hear and the songs you sing, 
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes.
It's one for all and all for one,
We work together, common sons.
Never need to wonder how or why.

We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls.
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,
All the gifts of life are held within our walls.

Look around this world we made,
Equality, our stock in trade.
Come and join the Brotherhood of Man.
Oh, what a nice contented world.
Let the banners be unfurled,
Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand.

We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,
Our great computers fill our hallowed halls. 
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,
All the gifts of life are held within our walls. 





What can this strange device be? 
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound.
It's got wires that vibrate and give music. 
What can this thing be that I found? 

See how it sings like a sad heart,
And joyously screams out its pain.
Sounds that build high like a mountain,
Or notes that fall gently like rain.

I can't wait to share this new wonder, 
The people will all see its light.
Let them all make their own music, 
The Priests praise my name on this night. 





I know it's most unusual to come before you so, 
But I've found an ancient miracle I thought that you should know.

Listen to my music, and hear what it can do.
There's something here as strong as life,
I know that it will reach you.

Yes, we know, it's nothing new, it's just a waste of time.
We have no need for ancient ways, the world is doing fine.

Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man!
Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan. 

I can't believe you're saying, these things just can't be true. 
Our world could use this beauty, just think what we might do.

Listen to my music, and hear what it can do.
There's something here as strong as life, 
I know that it will reach you. 

Don't annoy us further, we have our work to do.
Just think about the average -- what use have they for you? 

Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man. 
Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan. 





I wandered home though the silent streets,
And fell into a fitful sleep.
Escape to realms beyond the night,
Dream, can't you show me the light? 

I stand atop a spiral stair, 
An oracle confronts me there. 
He leads me on light years away 
Through astral nights, galactic days 

I see the works of gifted hands, 
That grace this strange and wondrous land.
I see the hand of man arise,
With hungry mind and open eyes.

They left the planet long ago,  
The elder race still learn and grow. 
Their power grows with purpose strong, 
To claim the home where they belong. 
Home, to tear the Temples down... 
Home, to change... 





The sleep is still in my eyes,
The dream is still in my head.
I heave a sigh and sadly smile, 
And lie a while in bed. 
I wish that it might come to pass, 
Not fade like all my dreams.

Just think of what my life might be, 
In a world like I have seen.
I don't think I can carry on, 
Carry on this cold and empty life. 
Oh, no... 

My spirits are low in the depths of despair...
My lifeblood spills over...



Attention, all Planets of the Solar Federation...
Attention, all Planets of the Solar Federation...
Attention, all Planets of the Solar Federation..
We have assumed control. 
We have assumed control. 
We have assumed control.



because of you
the sky above remaing clear and blue
its nothing new
the radio keeps playing static all 
your favorite songs
and why does everyone keep on bringing me back to you

If this is the sound
broken down
and this is the last train home 
the only underground
and this is the fall
don't catch me if i fall
just catch me when i fall
back to the ground

Lighting crashes all around me now
and here it sound
broken wings can carry us to where
people stare
fall asleep against the window pane
inside the rain
covers everyone now we're never gonna see the sun

If this is the sound
broken down
this is the last train home 
the only underground
and this is the fall
don't catch me if i fall
just catch me when i fall
don't catch me if i fall 
back to the ground

and if you wanted to stay 
i'll have you any day
and if you wanted to stay
i'll have you any way

If this is the sound
broken down
this is the last train home 
the only underground
and this is the fall
don't catch me if i fall
just catch me when i fall
back to the ground

If this is the sound 2x

If this is the fall
don't catch me if i fall
just catch me when i fall
don't catch me if i fall



Hey little sister give us laughter instead
Tears for the teacher, from the eyes, for her soul
This restless spirit takes a long way back home
Like the wind, you are free
Just a whisper I hear you, so talk to me
Oh, I believe, aye do aye
Say brother sisters, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's only glory from the story untold
Ah-ooh, oh I believe, aye do aye
Say brother sisters, see your brothers in the sky, oh-oh-oh
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's only glory from the story untold Ah-ooh, ooh Mm, yeah
Big fire, on top of the hill
A worthless gesture, and last farewell
Tears from your Mother, from the pits of her soul
Look at your Father, see his blood run cold
Like the wind, you are free
Just a whisper, I hear you, so talk to me
Oh, talk to me, Oh talk to me, Oh talk to me Oh, come on now, come on now
I believe, aye do aye
Say brothers sisters, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's only glory from the story untold Ah-ooh
I believe, aye do aye
Say brothers sisters, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's so much glory from the story untold
Ah-ooh, ooh I believe, I believe, I believe



Because it won't be worth your time tonight
I'm not listening
It seems like you only ever want to say goodbye
And I feel it every time that you walk into a room
Lights start flashing inside my head
I can't get past all the things you said
I believed in
Even though I knew they just couldn't be true
Not coming from you

Don't start acting like you're the only one who ever cried
There's someone just like you
For every burned-out building filling up the sky
I feel it every time that you walk into a room
It's so hard to stay in love when
You can't trust anyone



Would you take a walk with me?
I'll give you all I've got, just spare me your time
And I promise you won't want to leave

Are you
Are you falling for me?
This time
We'll find what we both need...

There's an old oak tree
We can swing and sway
Throw our guards away
You're so far away
When I look at you
You're so far away
I'm so far away
Oh, if you could just let go...

Wet your eyes with me, just for a while
I'll take you out of harm's way
And like these branches that shelter the rain
We can lay here in our own shade

Are you
Are you falling for me?
Just watch
The two of us will see...

There's an old oak tree
We can swing and sway
Throw our guards away
You're so far away
When I look at you
You're so far away
I'm so far away

There is so much that I could give to you
Just say you want me to
I know these roots could break the ground
And in the meantime, our leaves will turn
But rest assured, we'll get through anything

Are you
Are you falling for me?
Like I
Oh, I'm falling for you...

There's an old oak tree
We can swing and sway
Throw our guards away
You're so far away
It's just you and me
We can get away
We can get away
You're so far away
In this lover's play
We are happy here
Oh, in every way
Oh, and then we just let go...
Just let go
Just let go
Just let go
Just let go...



There's a sound, then it fades, turn it down, make it stay
If I could get off the phone I'd deliver the song
But too much is in my way
Like a dog to the bone, a leash to the throne, a laugh within my face
Taking too much air, taking too much air
This is how you care
When you realize you're down, when you realize you're
Down on the floor with a radio song, you're crawling, you're crawling,
Down on the floor with a radio song, Oh
We spent our days in a coma, believing it's over
Outside there's too much pain
Tried to stay on the ball, to believe in it all, but it bounces in our face
Now we're beginning to crawl by leaving it all, there's nothing in our way
Breathing out again, breathing out again
When it seems like you can, then you realize you're down
You realize you're
Down on the floor with a radio song, you're crawling, you're crawling,
Down on the floor with a radio song, Oh
When you realize you're down, when you realize you're down
From taking too much air, taking oxygen
We all want love and we all fall
Down on the floor with a radio song, you're crawling, you're crawling,
Down on the floor with a radio song, Oh



You talk about me and then
You go gonna kiss my ass
If you don't solve this soon you're gonna blow

I'll hit you Right in the eye
I'll hit you Right in the eye
Hit you Right in the eye
Hit you Right in the eye
I'll hit you right now

If you won't be nice then and you don't wanna be my friend
Just one more time and that will be the end

I'll hit you Right in the eye
I'll hit you Right in the eye
Hit you Right in the eye
Hit you Right in the eye
I'll hit you right now

Don't hang around
Don't be a pest to me
Learn to be me friend and be nice to me 

I'll hit you Right in the eye
I'll hit you Right in the eye
Hit you Right in the eye
Hit you Right in the eye
I'll hit you right now

Now 
Now
Now!



And it tries to give him shelter from the pain of what he saw
There's a child out the window painting faces in the snow
And they smile a sad reminder of a life he used to know

There's a house on the corner, lives a man with empty eyes
For his heart has been broken for he was sold a pack of lies

Hold me closer you know I can't
Hold me closer but you don't understand
Hold me closer, open your heart
Hold me closer I'm so alone
Hold me closer Oh you'll never know
Hold me closer, open your heart

For he fought for his country, now he fights to clear his name
For the dead are always heroes and the living live in shame

And he said
Hold me closer you know I can't
Hold me closer but you don't understand
Hold me closer, open your heart
Hold me closer I'm so alone
Hold me closer Oh you'll never know
Hold me closer, open your heart



It's clear to me that things aren't working out
We've come so far
But still you're in doubt

Since the start
You knew that I'm no innocent girl
'cause in my heart
There's something burning
A voice that's yearning for so much more

Bad girls - always on the run
Playing their game, leaving ruins behind
Bad girls - breaking the rules
Smile in your face while stealing your jewels

Face it - I just wanna be free
Feel sorry for you if you can't see
I'm just living my life - bad girl style

So you say
That I don't give a damn about you
The price I pay
For staying true to who I am

Don't wanna leave
So don't make leaving all that's left for me
Just let me breathe
'cause there's something burning
A voice that's yearning inside of me

Bad girls - always on the run
Playing their game, leaving ruins behind
Bad girls - breaking the rules
Smile in your face while stealing your jewels

Face it - I just wanna be free
Feel sorry for you if you can't see
That I'm just living my life - bad girl style

Don't try to lock me in a golden cage
'cause I'm not a doll that you can show around
And I won't hesitate to turn the page
One... two... three... four...

Bad girls - always on the run
Playing their game, leaving ruins behind
Bad girls - breaking the rules
Smile in your face while stealing your jewels

Face it - I just wanna be free
Feel sorry for you if you can't see
That I'm just living my life - bad girl style



Junked the juice, drink coffee instead
Straightened my teeth, bent my back
Cut my friends dead from the old rat pack
For Mary
She bought me this silk suit, watch and chain
She put the rhythm in my stride again
She showed me the way to make her feel good
If I could do more then I surely would
For Mary
For Mary
For the sake of Mary I do what I can
She still don't trust me to be her man
I say the right thing but my tiiming's bad
She thinks I'm like the rest, but I'm the best she's ever had
For the sake of Mary
I was cook first class on the Belfast B
But when she sailed she sailed without me
In Needle Pete's got my last tattoo
In bleeding letters of red and blue
For Mary
For the sake of Mary I changed my drift
Got a good job on the graveyard shift
She set her heart on a pretty little place
I want to see the tears of joy on her face
For Mary
For the Sake of Mary I keep the flame
I don't want to be the villain again
She's had her bad times and it's shook her about
I don't want to take the easy way out
For the sake of Mary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Right before our eyes and we can't see
How quickly time is fading away
Don't look so surprised
You knew this day was coming for so long
Forget about all your lies and all your indecisions
Time is fading
One day the earth and sky will burn


And all that we'll be left with
Is the truth of God and the souls of man
From the beginning all we knew
Is our days were numbered and time was slowly fading
From the beginning all we knew
Is our days were numbered and time was fading away
Everything is burning away



I still hate you, motherfuckers everyone
Wrapped in glory, bound so tightly
I still need you even when I'm overcome

Saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
To be saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright

I'm the Trickster, burnt so badly
I still hate you, motherfuckers everyone
Wore my sickness so politely
I can be your everything to everyone

Void of meaning, swelled just slightly
I still need you, I still need you
Gone forever so concisely
I still need you, I still need you

Saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
To be saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright

And if you hate the world
Let's say I've been there
And if you hate yourself
Well don't go changing

All the times I used your body
Done my way, can't say I'm sorry
Ripped the gloss off all your memories
Consequences so demanding
Bruised and beaten, conscience bleeding
Sexually, sexually, sexually

Saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
To be saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright

And I'm saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
Let me go bright



That could take you higher...



Little by little, I call your name
Little by little, my tears fall
Little by little, everything changes

Little by little, the time go
Little by little, the days pass by
Little by little, the air clears
Little by little, I can breathe again

I can breathe again
I can breathe again, now
I can breathe again

Back at the mirror, your good friend
Talk to the mirror, play out your game
Slap in the middle, I stop then
Look at the winner and the price you pay, mmm

Cold was the winter, I tremble
Long was the fall that had no end
Now little by little, the air clears
Little by little, I can breathe, I can breathe again

I can breathe again
I can breathe again, now

Call your name, call your name
Call your name, call your name
Everything changes, everything changes
I call your name

Oh, I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
Ooh, ooh
Little by little



Consummated
Rest the head
It just holds us back now
And still she keeps on looking
Of course, of course
And now there's nothing I hate as much

Wet the lips
Shut your pretty mouth
Use the kiss
Tommorrow fails to exist
And still she keeps on looking
Of course, of course
And now there's nothing I...

It all surfaces in this light
It all surfaces in this light
It all surfaces in this light
It all surfaces in this...
It All surfaces...

Words under my breath
Taking my time
Breaking your smile

Feed the wish
And let it flourish
Head for shore
And let me haunt you
And still she keeps on looking
Of course, of course
And now there's nothing I hate as much
And now there's nothing I hate as much

I will sleep
It all surfaces in this light
Throughout the infection
Fast asleep
Where nothing can find me

Words under my breath
Taking my time
Breaking your smile
Everyone goes away
I can't even try
I watched you slip away

Words under my breath
Taking my time
Breaking your smile
Everyone goes away
I won't even try
I watched you slip away



Can't say you have it 'til you know what you find
To get it right and to make it in time
It's down to myself and my friends help me along
It's not what you say it's the feeling that's the song

It's strange, it seems
I hadn't felt it
'Til I got home
I drove right back to the place again
I said listen; way back to the bone
I'm coming home

This time I was open, this time I was greased
And make some suggestions and call out my peace
I've got to keep movin', keep movin' along
It's not what you say it's the feeling that's the song

It's strange, it seems
I hadn't felt it
'Til I got home
I drove right back to the place again
I said listen; way back to the bone
I'm coming home

Well, well, oh well
Well, well, you know darn well

Can't say you have it 'til you know what you find
To get it right and to make it in time
It's down to myself and my friends help me along
It's not what you say it's the feeling that's the song

It's strange, it seems
I hadn't felt it
'Til I got home
I drove right back to the place again
I said listen; way back to the bone
I'm coming home

I'm coming home
Coming home
I'm coming home

You'd better get ready
You'd better get ready, yeah, yeah
You don't forget to bring it
You don't forget to bring it
Say, you don't forget to bring it
Whooo
Go boy, don't forget
Oooh yeah



A cold sting on my lips
The reckoning is almost here
Fuck your fear

New gravediggers born each day
Diggin' holes right where you lay
The reckoning is almost here
Fuck your fear

This don't seem like the end
It seems more like a bad beginning
Don't hesitate
Fuck your fear

Weakness coughs, then ricochets
Our boredom bleeds us wide awake
The reckoning is in the air
Fuck your fear

Dead folksingers lie in state
Acolytes scrape off their plates
The message falls onto deaf ears



Cruising in the moonlight
Ooh your aim is steady
Your eyes are hungry and your hands are ready
You shot me where you wanted 
You put me in a daze

No matter where you go, you'll always be a stranger
Getting into trouble, getting off on danger
Riding out of town like a cool lone ranger
When there's nothing to lose, you gotta call your own plays
Did anybody say something incredibly stupid
Like there isn't any paradise
But I remember the songs and I remember the story
I remember the thrills and I remember the glory

So hold me - hold me in your arms
Deliver me from growing old
Hold me - hold me in your arms
Shelter me from going cold
I'm a shot in the dark without you
A rebel without a clue

Rebel without a clue
I don't know what to say and I don't know what to do
Standing on the corner in my boots and my leather
a little over the edge, a little under the weather
Just a rebel without a clue
I'm tired an lonely and crying for you
I know just when to sulk and I know just how to pose
Dirty Harry to Madonna 
I've been learning all the roles

So hold me baby, hold me a little longer
Need me baby just a little stronger tonight
Move it darling move a little quicker
Prove it darling blood is really thicker tonight
Drive on darling drive a little farther
Dream on darling dream a little harder tonight
Teach me baby teach me how to love you
Without me you're just another rebel without a clue

It's been a long hot summer an it's just the beginning
So keep our motor running and your tires spinning
So many places that I've wanted to be in
Take me where you're going - away beyond above -
We'll see a little action, relieve a little tension
Stuff I'd like to try that I shouldn't even mention
I've gone so far already c- I'm way beyond redemption
There's nothing to it really - I think they call it love

Did anybody say something incredibly stupid
Like there isn't any paradise
But I remember the songs and I remember the story
I remember the thrills and I remember the glory

So hold me - hold me in your arms
Deliver me from growing old
Hold me - hold me in your arms
Shelter me from going cold
I'm a shot in the dark without you
A rebel without a clue

Rebel without a clue
I don't know what to say and I don't know what to do
Standing on the corner in my boots and my leather
A little over the edge, a little under the weather
Just a rebel without a clue
I'm tired and lonely and crying for you
I know just when to sulk and I know just how to pose
Dirty Harry to Madonna 
I've been learning all the roles

So hold me baby, hold me a little longer
Need me baby just a little stronger tonight
Move it darling move a little quicker
prove it darling blood is really thicker tonight
Drive on darling drive a little farther
Dream on darling dream a little harder tonight
Teach me baby teach me how to love you
Without me you're just another rebel without a clue



Cause nobody I know's got a brother like him
As kids we could never be parted
The neighbours all knew us as the terible twins
At school some kids where always looks for a fight
And Martin never wanted a fuss
Ol' Big Mouth Brown thought he's push us around 
Being three year older than us
So I smash him in the teeth with a cloakroom stool 
Got six of the best and suspended from school

But it was worth with a brother like Martin
Martin
It was worth it with a brother like him

We used to nick motors for a joy ride 
'Till we rammed a Black Mariah in this XJ 6 
To give my brother time to get clear 
I had to punch a few policemen before I was nicked
Got borstal for taking and driving away
And beating up the boys in blue
But Martin never missed a single visiting day
Hitched from Clapham to Crewe
With all me racing mags and the little bits of news

Smuggling in ciggies and a little bit of booze

No one ever had a brother like Martin 
No one ever had a brother like him

Look, people get the wrong impression with Martin
I know he didn't mix much but he's no snob
The weekend I got out of remand home
He got Uncle Ruby to find me this job 
And back at my Nan's he'd repainted my room
And bought me a brand new carpet
There was all me old records and books on a shelf
And a secondhand telly from the market
You can get a bit hard when you've been inside
But I hugged the old bastard and I almost cried 

Cos no-one ever had a brother like Martin
No-one ever had a brother like him

Cos no-one ever had a brother like Martin 
No-one ever had a brother like him



Groovin's so easy, baby, if you know how.
You don't have to keep yourself forever, baby,
Go out and chase whatever you're cravin',
It doesn't have to be,
No, no, it doesn't have to be,
So hard on you.

There's nobody stopping you, baby, there's just yourself,
And if you can't see that, baby, girl you need help.
I could teach you things, you never could learn,
Show you just exactly how you got burned.
It doesn't have to be,
No, no, it doesn't have to be,
So hard on you.

It's easy to see now, baby, you're nobody's fool,
But you won't gain nothing, baby, by staying cool.
Better leave all your troubles and worries behind,
Give in to something, well it crossed your mind.
It doesn't have to be,
No, no, it doesn't have to be,
So hard on you.



It's not gonna be too hard.
If there's no parking on the street pull up on the front yard.
Don't bring no vodka, or whiskey,
we've got everything you need.
Just bring a pair of your dancing shoes and get down to this beat.

Let's go down.
Wash that sugar down.
You gotta realize that.
Because there ain't no party
like the party going on in my house.
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year.
Because there ain't no party
like the party going on in my house,
but it would be so much better if you were only here.
Mmmm, oh,
that's right.
Mmmm,
prom night, oscar night, got all that BS beat.

There's twenty girls for every single boy
and they're crazy from this heat.
We'll take you up and down and everywhere in between.
Mom and Dad are out of town all week,
so you better get on your feet.

Let's go down.
Wash that sugar down.
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house.
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year,
because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house,
but it would be so much better if you were only here. Mmmm.

Everything you ever wanted from this life is gonna happen right now.
Oooh, those girls tend to hide,
and the temperatures rise,
better reach for the sky and raise up the ceiling...

Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house.
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year.
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house,
but it would be so much better if you were only here.
If only you were here.



"I'll take away your tears, and stay with you for years"
Sat in the grass, up on a hill, the air so still, you came to me to say
"I will wash away your fears, and stay with you for years"

I lay beneath the wings of an angel
I'm standing in the shadow of a saint
All roads are long and no one can deny them
Everything will come to those who wait

And in the time it takes a man to fall, I'll stand up and take it all
I'll take you all with me, put you on your seat

I lay beneath the wings of an angel
I'm standing in the shadow of a saint
All roads are long and no one can deny them
Everything will come to those who wait
I'll stay beneath the wings of an angel
I'm standing in the shadow of a saint
I'll stay beneath the wings of an angel
I'll stay beneath the wings of an angel

I'm standing in the shadow of a saint
I'll stay beneath the wings of an angel
I'll stay beneath the wings of an angel



Controlling you like a marionette robot
Or else how could you have said those things?
Or else how could I have stopped your heart?
I did the autopsy with my scalpel
And found that, yes, my brand new theory was true
And the creature was a nasty bugger
And she bit my arm clear right through

But now I know that wasn't really you
Girl Number Two
But now I know that wasn't really you

"The death of Girl Number Two," read the first line
Written by a fond paper columnist
Actually happened in the '20s
And since she's been inhabited
By an oddly whimsical creature
She was a marionette to its hand
Full stop, and then the whole story
See, and everyone sighed when it ran

But now I know that wasn't really you
Girl Number Two
But now I know that wasn't really you

But now I know that wasn't really you
Girl Number Two
But now I know that wasn't really you



In the garden
Outside my window.

Oh, oh, oh.

You're like your father,
I see right through you.
Just like your father
I thought I knew you.

Oh, oh, oh.

It's a panic
In paradise,
It's a panic,
It's in paradise

You can't come here,
You can't cry.
You can't come here,
You can't cry.

I see her playing
In the garden.
I was once like her,
You did this to me.

I don't remember
When this offense began.
I don't remember
I can't undo what's done.

You can't come here,
You can't cry.
You can't come here,
You can't cry.
You can't come here,
You know why.
You can't come here,
You know why.

I'll keep my secret
With me until I die,
I'll keep my secret
And I don't know why.

You can't come here,
You can't cry.
You can't come here,
You know why.
I can't go there,
I won't cry.
I can't go there,
I won't cry.



Have a big slice of the city
Get the upper hand
While you're still pretty

But you know what we're like
No, they will never respect you
The way you want them to respect you
I think it's very well understood

But I'm
I'm gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
You

Your cracked up shell
A dead opera house
You give yourself to them now
In a game of cat and mouse

From the storyboard
To the bedroom scene
Through eleven World Wars
Other people you have been

Well I'm
Gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
You

Oh I'm
Gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
You

I can come to terms
With slowly going mad
Things we used to fear in the dark
And what ever lies beyond that

But I've come to resemble
My own shadow
As it falls into the sidewalk
I'm no longer anyone I know

No-one here reminds me of you
Yet I see no-one else
On the crowded sidewalk

Well I'm
I'm gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
You

Oh I'm
I'm gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
Hold on to you
Hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you



Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are North Americans
And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no

We build our planes and our trains till we think we might die
Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
Uh-huh, oh, oh

I hate the feelin' when you're looking at me that way
'Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay
Makes it go away

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're North American
But in the end we make the same mistakes all over again
Come on, North Americans

Oh, we are North American scum
Oa, we're from North America

And all the kids, all the kids, that want to make a scene
Here in North America
When our young kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those

So where's the love, where's the love, where's the love, where's the love
Where's the love tonight?
But there's no love man, there's no love and the kids are uptight
Uh, uh

So throw a party till the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go, North Americans
Oh, you were planning it I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry

I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in North America
But then I said the more I do it, the better it gets
Let's rock, North America

Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we're from North America
Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we are North American

New York's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo, North America
And it's the furthest you can live from the government
Uh-huh, huh

Some fat American Christians might disagree
Here in North America
But New York's the only place we keep them off the street
Boo, boo

Now we can't have parties like in Spain where they go all night
Shut down in North America
Or like Berlin where they go another night, alright
Uh-huh, uh-huh

You see I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, North America
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'Cause we're North Americans

Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we're are North Americans
Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we love North America

Take me back to the states, man
North American scum
Where we can be in any one of million new bands
North American

Where the DJ gigs aren't as fun
Here in North American scum
But don't blame the Canadians
Look out North America



That it would be this hard
Love is meant to be forever, no or never seems to discard
There's gotta be a better way for me to say
What's on my heart without leaving scars?
Can you hear me when I call your name?

And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow?
There's so much to be said and with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?

Complicated situations are the makings of all that's wrong
And I've been standing in the river of deliverance way too long
There's gotta be a better way for me to say
What's on my heart without leaving scars?
Can you hear me when I call your name?
So can you hear me when I call your name?

And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow?
There's so much to be said and with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?



Well patience never was one of your true virtues
Stop trying to control everything, and fuck what they say
What do you have to prove?

So why am I waiting?
This time that I'm wasting
If that's what you mean
So why am I waiting?
This time that I'm wasting
If that's what you mean

How will this be when all is said and done?
Will I know where I'm from, remember me?
Where will I be?
I guess I'm on the run
And time is catching up behind me
Behind me, yeah
Behind me, you
Behind me

And I'm scared to be the only one
Who sees the hourglass empty, cuz too much time went by
Why do I try to prove that I will be ready for everything thrown at me

So why am I waiting?
This time that I'm wasting
If that's what you mean
So why am I waiting?
This time that I'm wasting
If that's what you mean

How will this be when all is said and done?
Will I know where I'm from, remember me?
Where will I be?
I guess I'm on the run
And time is catching up behind me

How will this be when all is said and done?
Will I know where I'm from, remember me?
Where will I be?
I guess I'm on the run
And time is catching up behind me

These thoughts trickle down
Imaginary lines cut through the ground
These thoughts trickle down
Imaginary lines cut through the ground

So why am I waiting?
This time that I'm wasting
If that's what you mean
So why am I waiting?
This time that I'm wasting
If that's what you mean

How will this be when all is said and done?
Will I know where I'm from, remember me?
Where will I be?
I guess I'm on the run
And time is catching up behind me

How will this be when all is said and done?
Will I know where I'm from, remember me?
Where will I be?
I guess I'm on the run
And time is catching up behind me



You keep it all in 
You know your problem 
You keep it all in 

That's right 
The conversation we had last night 
When all I wanted to do was 
Knife you in the heart 
I kept it all in 

You know your problem 
You keep it all in 
You know your problem 
You keep it all in 

Midnight, a husband getting ready to fight 
A daughter sleeps alone with the light 
Turned on, she hears but 
Keeps it all in 

Just like that murder in '73 
Just like that robbery in '62 
With all these things that have happened to me 
I kept them all in 
Why do you keep on telling me now 

You know your problem 
You keep it all in 
You know your problem 
You keep it all in 

That's sweet 
That conversation we had last week 
When you gagged and bound me up to my seat 
You're right, I do 
I keep it all in



On a night like this
Can't you feel the fever, in the air
Hear my voice callin' out for you
And you can't resist
When you taste the passion we could share
'Cause you know

One touch from you could make sparks fly
I've got a secret that I can't hide
Hold on baby and you will see

Hot, hot for you
Ooh, you got me burnin' up
Hot, hot for you
Feel my body turnin' so
Hot, hot for you
Come and get it while it's hot

You should know not to stand too close
When you play with fire
Boy, I got a hunger you can't tame
Tell me now will you let your love
Cool my desire
Before it all goes up in flames
'Cause you know

Hot, hot for you
Ooh, you got me burnin' up
Hot, hot for you
Feel my body turnin' so
Hot, hot for you
I never get enough



Can you tell me
What am i becoming?
What am i doing to my self?
This is not me now
Can you tell me why i'm self destructing?
How can i live with all this?
And i am breaking to pieces
How long will i lose this war
I can't take much more
I am losing now
Will you help me?
How can i explain this?
How can i justify myself?
I am losing now
Will you help me?
Cause i can't remember
All that i've lived with for so long
I am breaking to pieces
How long will i lose this war
No i can't take much more
This is not me now
Can you tell me what am i becoming?
What am i doing to myself?
What am i doing to myself?
I'm self-destructing
I am breaking to pieces
How long will i lose this war
I can't take much more
Breaking to pieces
How long will i lose this war
Now i can't take much more
And i am breaking to pieces
How long will i lose this war
I can't take much more



Keeping up
Seeing this thing through
I want to know 
Who you're running from 
Me or you
You're too confused to open up 
Feel the way I do
I want to know 
Who you're thinking of 
Cause I really have no clue

Another game 
Of charades
Don't you know everybody plays
I don't want to lose to you that way
Maybe we'll be different 
This time around
Maybe we'll be different 
I don't know
Don't want to strangle this, so I'm holding back for now

Calm down 
Don't take it too far
I know only time can heal your scars
So I'm ready when you are 
When you are
I'm ready when you are
Don't want any false starts
I can do without the time apart
So I'm ready when you are 
When you are
I'm ready when you are

Are you having trouble 
Keeping up 
You know that I will wait
I wonder 
If it's good enough 
To make you stay
You're too confused to open up 
You don't know what to say
Well you can tell me 
If you think it's love 
I won't be far away

Another game 
Of charades
Don't you know everybody plays
I don't want to lose to you that way
Maybe we'll be different 
This time around
Maybe we'll be different 
I don't know
Don't want to strangle this, so I'm holding back for now

Calm down 
Don't take it too far
I know only time can heal your scars
So I'm ready when you are 
When you are
I'm ready when you are
Don't want any false starts
I can do without the time apart
So I'm ready when you are 
When you are
I'm ready when you are

I want to know 
If you're thinking of me
I'll be counting the hours even though I know I'm free
Too soon to take a chance 
No more questions left to ask
I could be anything 
But the one thing I'm not sure you want to be

Calm down 
Don't take it too far
I know only time can heal your scars
I'm ready when you are 
When you are
I'm ready when you are
Don't want any false starts
I can do without the time apart
I'm ready when you are 
When you are
I'm ready when you are

Calm down 
Don't take it too far
I know only time can heal your scars
So I'm ready when you are 
When you are
I'm ready when you are
Calm down
Don't want any false starts
I can do without the time apart
So I'm ready when you are 
When you are
I'm ready when you are

Calm down
I'm ready when you are 



Whose dealings were coarse.
The c.i.t.e.s. cited permits
But he could show no source.
Did they bloom in his mouth?
Did they bloom in his hand
Did they bloom in his pocket?
Did they bloom on demand?

The doctor who invented anesthesia
Could not anesthetize himself
To the pain and shame he felt
When it wore off on a patient
During his first amputation.

This giving in is wearing thin.



When I saw this girl, dark brown eyes and a dark olive tan
She was watching the sets with a surfboard underneath her arm
The first moment I saw her I knew she'd do me some harm
She's so good

She came out of the water with the best session I'd seen
Man she had the biggest chi chi's I had ever seen
She put down her board, and sat down next to me
And played a soft ole lonely tune on her ukulele

I dont know what had happened, but I'd fallen asleep
The next morning I woke up, she was sleeping next to me


AAAAHHHH I fell in love with her,AAAAHHHH Im so in love with her
AAAAHHHH I fell in love with her, AAAAHHHH my little surfer girl

She got out of bed and waxed up both our boards
Grabbed me by the hand and then she took me out the door
We surfed all that day long, at least eight hours straight
Man I knew that she was the one and damn I couldn't wait

Well I asked if she loved me
She said, "Yea well I guess"
So I asked her to marry me, dammit you know she said "Yes"


AAAAHHHH I fell in love with her,AAAAHHHH Im so in love with her
AAAAHHHH I fell in love with her, AAAAHHHH my little surfer girl

I was at the alter, in my tuxedo-o-o
Waiting for my surfer girl, man where did she go?
Later on that day, a friend of me did tell-ell-ell
That she went to Mexico,to catch a, to catch a, to catch a 10 foot swell
Ah That Bitch!


I fell in love with her, Im so in love with her
I fell in love with her, my little surfer girl
My surfer girl



There's something you should know right now
There's something you should see
Have you ever seen a burning sky
From a hundred yards away?
Have you ever seen a falling skyline
In the wake of a thousand flames?

It's now or never, baby, you better hold your breath tonight
We're gonna burn this city, it won't be pretty
We kill at twilight

Say your prayers and don't look back
The moon is hanging low tonight
In a sky that's painted black
Tell everyone it's do or die time
They're never safe out in the streets
Tell everyone it's do or die time
In the wake of the blazing heat

We have the strength of ten men
When we go down we get up again

We have the power of a barrel blazing red
We're in your head 
We have the power of a barrel blazing red
We wake the dead



I can hardly breathe again
Into your arms and a perfect day
From the garden where we lay
With the roses all aflame
You called my name and I meant to say
It's been too long, so long

I looked for your face watching down from the window
Wave me till I'm gone
I remember the dress you wore
And you're still here with me, but maybe
Dorothy it's been too long, so long

Now I'm waiting in the dark
In the strangeness of your bed
To hide my face where you lay your head
As I listen to the room
And it speaks about a distance never met
You were there and yet
Dorothy it's been too long, so long

You left without saying goodbye
And I was so impatient then
Always one too cynical to pray
But I talked to you today
D'you hear me?
Dorothy it's been too long, so long



Nothing for me

I look around the trees
and saw nothing for me

Nothing for me
Nothing for me

I look around and 'round
and there was nothing for me

Maybe somebody broke and took away
all the gifts for me

Why did they go to all the trouble then 
to take my gift only

Nothing for me
Nothing for me

I look around the trees
and found nothing for me

for me
for me



Rules you know I'm bending 'em
All the cool kids on the back of the bus
High like Mt. Everest looking for some leverage
Floating like some vapors coolin like a beverage
I cherish the moment when I get the lucky chance
To sing my song and let the funky people dance

Make it last. Sonic blasts move past fast fly
Outta speaker's sneakers stomp to the rhythm that will romp

Let the wild rumpus start cause it
Just can't stop
And all the cool kids in the back of the bus
Cop a feel
Steal a kiss miss
I hope ya won't regret it
And all of the kids in the back I hope you get it

All the cool kids in the back of the bus
Rubba dubba scrubba bubba
Whatchu talkin' bout gus breakin the rules
I hope we don't get caught

All of the kids in the back quit buggin
Get your hands in the vehicle before you lose something
Keep bouncin to the beat of wheels that are bumpin
Get your ass out of bed
Cause you know the bus is coming
If you miss the damn bus well you better start running
Brown bag full of grub
Yo you gotta eat something
Keep rockin to the rhythm of the windshield wipers
Staying up late night all nighters
Keepin busy too much work is making you dizzy
All the cool kids in the back are you with me?

All the cool kids in the back of the bus
Rubba dubba scrubba bubba whatchu talkin' bout gus
Breakin the rules I hope we don't get caught

Road trip runnin with the music up loud
Take a trip from the north to the dirty south
Wherever it leads ya/ overheated on the side of the road
Sweating that ass 25 cent cologne
Sticking to the seats like a lil piece of gum
And all of the kids in the back want to come
In the back of the bus its a make out session
She's got the salad an I've got the dressing

All the cool kids in the back of the bus
Rubba dubba scrubba bubba whatchu talkin' bout gus
Breakin the rules I hope we don't get caught

Gotta get home and study for my final
Write your name on the back of the bus seat vinyl
Sitting on the stool by the principles office
Gettin chewed out cut down cut up cut out run up
Punished with demerits and detention
"oh its you again" please don't put me back in summer school
I'm just a kid
One of many
Trying to have a little fun bendin'
A couple of the rules on the back of the bus
THE BACK OF THE BUS



They wanted to be famous like you read in books
Shane had the brain and Dxie had the looks for glory
As a bank robber Shane really hadn't got a clue
He'd end up likely at the end of a noose
Which was fine by Shane if the papers could use the story
Fame and love, fame and love
Fame and love will never die
Shane said to Dixie, we're getting nowhere
But I've a fine idea if you love me, swear
We'll be household names if we only dare, forever
Here's two bullets in my old carbine
One is yours and the other is mine
Then we'll be happy till the end of time together
She screams, she swears
She tears her hair
Saying, Shane this time
You've lost your mind
Shane took aim with the 16-bore
And Dixie lay dying down there on the floor
Shane was shaken but his purpose was more inspired
Shane said, Lord what have I done
But this victory is only halfway won
Then he put the barrel underneath his tongue and fired
They found the bodies when the neighbours complained
Shane was all over the walls like paint
Dixie looked bad but her heart beat faint but surely
Well they saved her life, they were just in time
And she turned her back on a life of crime
And she married the man who came to type out her story
O the news of the screws most generously gave
The money helped to pay for Shane's new grave
And it looked so fine till the vandals sprayed it over
Time went by and the weeds grew high
And hid Shane's grave from the curious eye
And maybe that's why we forget those lines he told her
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



God, I'm such a stain
I just keep fucking up again and again

I don't believe
I don't believe
That I could be so stupid and so naive
I don't believe
I don't believe
That there is nothing, nothing left for me

You crawled into my mind when you crawled into my bed
Said everything I've ever longed to hear
So perfect, so alive, once inside you sucked me dry
Used me up and left me here for dead

I don't believe
I don't believe
That I could be so stupid and so naive
I don't believe
I don't believe
That there is nothing, nothing left for me

I crave it desperately, it's a cancer eating me
An addiction too intense to be denied
Worthless, I'm a whore, crawling back for more
It's pathetic how I feed off this abuse

I don't believe
I don't believe
That I could be so stupid and so naive
I don't believe
I don't believe
That there is nothing, nothing left for me
I feel so stupid

You told me that you loved me
And I believed, and you left me
You swore that you loved me
And I believed, now I know it was a lie
Now I know it was a lie
Now I know it was...

I don't believe
I don't believe
That I could be so stupid and so naive
I don't believe
I don't believe
That there is nothing, nothing left for me

I don't believe
I don't believe
That I could be so stupid and so naive
I don't believe
I don't believe
That there is nothing, nothing left for me



As I use them
These are the words that let me be forgiveen
The minute I choose them
So I won't try try try
To sell my advice
It's meant to be forgotten
The minute you try
The lies take the place
Of advice

But I can't say
If I'm awake
Like I say
We're built that way where I'm from
An extension of
Lacan's way
A mirror stage
Of disappointment
Where you're from

Give me a clue when these words were written
In reference to use them
So when they're gone they intend to be forgotten
The minute you choose them
There's not much point
Accepting your advice
Like oh to be forgotten
It only takes two minutes for you
To change your mind

But I can't say
If I'm awake
Like I say
We're built that way where I'm from
An extension of
Lacan's way
A mirror stage
Of disappointment
Where you're from



Lips were red hot
At the greatest show on earth
At the feeding of five thousand
Well I don't know what you heard
Eyes were bloodshot
Lips were red hot
Sweet bliss fragrance fills the air
Resuscitating all the breathless
Reviving eveybody there
Two fishes as the spirit
FIve loaves of bread the soul
At the feeding of five thousand
Where the baskets overflowed

Love is reaches through the darkness
Loves the king of golden rules
Bombs are falling as we're dancing
To this man made sonic boom
Love is reaches through the darkness
Loves the king of golden rules
Golden rules, golden roles

Eyes were bloodshot
Lips were red hot
At the greatest show on earth
At the feeding of five thousand
Well I don't know what you heard
Eyes were bloodshot
Lips were red hot
Sweet bliss fragrance fills the air
Resuscitating all the breathless
Reviving eveybody there
Two fishes as the spirit
FIve loaves of bread the soul
At the feeding of five thousand
Where the baskets overflowed



Without love
They're just a burden from our tongues
The taste remains but without faith
We're still an arms length away
But somehow we're burning brighter
You'll never be more beautiful than today
Whole-hearted we're open
Our madness silent
Cause we know when you come
You come in love

Cause love is all we need
And I came here with nothing
But I left with everything
And all the truth you bring
And I came here with nothing
But I left with everything

To be honest
We're older
And life makes us stand in disbelief
Are we who we want to be
But I've learned that it's ok
To be broken at your feet
And it's where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

Cause love is all we need
And I came here with nothing
But I left with everything
And all the truth you bring
And I came here with nothing
But I left with everything

Your faith is only as strong as the words you speak 
So speak, speak, speak

Cause love is all we need
And I came here with nothing
But I left with everything
And all the truth you bring
And I came here with nothing
But I left with everything
And I came here with nothing
But I left with everything
And I came here with nothing, God
But I left with everything



palpitations and goo-goo eyes, the transformation is sad and sickly
she pulled out a "Tyson" from out of the blue, and met with a sickening crunch 


she got me... woah, she got me
she got me... with a suckerpunch 


senses reeling from too much shit, I hit the floor again, panic, panic!
calm and cold as a witches tit, sometimes I think I act cosmically
with all of the shit that flew out of my lips, there's no use in asking much 


she got me... woah, she got me
she got me... with a sucker... sucker... sucker... waah, you fucker! 


one... two... three... four...
{mosh!} 

why I see her face in a million stars, I'm wondering
thought I had good taste 'til I found I'd none at all
nearly did appear as the asshole of the year
and then she strikes...
and now I'm back, the guy I've been, before the idiot sat in 

can't believe that I got so down, it probably happens on a daily basis
many millions of messed up minds compete to win in the loser races
peeling my mind like she's one of a kind, or maybe just out to lunch 


she got me... woah, she got me
she got me... with a suckerpunch



We have made all the bans we imposed
We have thrown
On ourselves
In memory's manner

The weakended will
Raise their heads
To mellow their somber faces
This day you will
Be in your camp
In the streets of your people

You are at
The summit of the honored
Decorate yourselves



I know I’m breathing but am I alive?
Check my vital signs before they disappear
O God, are You near?

I am in distress
Come and save my life
This is my S.O.S.
Screaming up to the sky
Holy Father, make us whole
‘Cause You alone
Can save our souls

Precious time is ticking away
And all that I can do is pray
‘Cause this is sink or swim
And I am lost at sea
O Go, rescue me

My cry for redemption
I’m a dying breed
Give me salvation
You’re the one I need



In you I never had a doubt
Although you were a part of me
I just had to spit you out
You never listen, you never hear a word I say
You burn me inside, so I put you in your place

Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out

I cannot believe it's taken so long
To obtain the sight I need
The taste of your lips I RECALL
Now burning black inside of me, inside me



Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out

Spit you out, spit you out
You're nothing to me
You're nothing to me
You make me act so obscene
You're nothing to me, stop f**king with me
You never listen, you never hear a word I say

Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Spit you out, spit you out



Parade from paradise
End the need for Eden
Chase the dreams of merchandise

There is tic and toc in atomic
Leaders make a deal
The cosmic is largely comic
A con they couldn't conceal

There is no safe seat at the feast
Take your best stab at the beast
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Raise the art to resistance
Danger dare to be grand
Pride reduced to humble pie
Diamonds down to sand

Take heart in the earth and the weather
The brightness of new birth
Take heart on the harvest
Shave the harvest from the earth

There is no safe seat at the feast
Take your best stab at the beast
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Reasoning is partly insane
Image just an eyeless game
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Miracles will have their claimers
More will bow to Rome
He and she are in the house
But it's only me at home

Rose is a rose of splendor
Posed to respond in the end
Lonely things like nights,
I find, end finer with a friend

I hear in the rate of her heart
A tear in the heat of the art
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

There is no safe seat at the feast
Take your best stab at the beast
The night turns thin
The saint turns to sin



I thought this through
I'm full of stress
I'm outside of you.

I've been thinking,
will she leave me?

                  and you are here waiting 
                  for me to break 
                  but I am not changing
                  I won't listen...

                  My time alone 
                  and you are here waiting 
                  for me to break 
                  but I am not changing
                  I won't listen...

Apart from me
torn from the floor
honestly, I can't give you more.

I've been breathing 
since you left me.

                  and you are here waiting 
                  for me to break 
                  but I am not changing
                  I won't listen...

                  My time alone 
                  and you are here waiting 
                  for me to break 
                  but I am not changing
                  I won't listen
                  I won't listen to you

I'm not leaving
with you
I won't listen

Time away
you've lost all control
and I'm in need
of this time alone

and I've been breathing
since you left me.

                  and you are here waiting 
                  for me to break 
                  but I am not changing
                  I won't listen...

                  My time alone 
                  and you are here waiting 
                  for me to break 
                  but I am not changing
                  I won't listen
                  I'm not leaving
                  I won't listen to you.



Of the sheep the have fooled
And preach their code of conduct:
"You've gotta push that, push that product"
We'll live in fear, for coats they may sheer
The fleecing of a fleeting flock
You may have my wool
You may have my locks
But my voice you have not
My voice you have not
We're sitting ducks, with feathers plucked

You hide your fangs so cleverly dear
You sing your songs so prettily

I'll never fall for the
Hook line and sinker
Your smoke and mirrors
I wont ever take the bait
I'll never fall for those
Formats and figures
Your greedy fingers
Won't ever get their hands on me

Hey boy, you best look out
"Ooh, we'll have you."
Pay mind to those greedy people climbers
They're licking their lips at you
They'll crush and they'll claw
Their way to the top
Your legs are just ladders to them
Your head's just another step man
On you like a rash
On you like a rash

I'll never fall for the
Hook line and sinker
Your smoke and mirrors
I wont ever take the bait
I'll never fall for those
Formats and figures
Your greedy fingers
Won't ever get their hands on me

Even though you hide your fangs so cleverly dear
You sing you songs so prettily dear
Your most gentle call
Your most soothing song won't lead this sheep astray

All these suits with big black lives
Can't put me on the company's dime
I won't be bought
No I won't be sold

All these greasy palms and greedy hands
All my supply all your demand
I'm not you whore
And I won't be your Babylon



How can I brace myself for razor blades on whips
When everything with meaning is shattered, broken, screaming
And I'm lost inside this darkness and I fear I won't survive

I could pray and trick with a double tongue, but the only fool here's me
I choose the way to go, but the road won't set me free
Cos I wish you'd see me, baby, save me, I'm going crazy
Tryin' to keep us real, keep us alive

This day will die tonight and there ain't no exception
We shouldn't wait for nothing to wait for
Love me in this fable, babe, my heart is in your hand
Our time is waiting right outside your door
And maybe tomorrow is a better day

I do not deal the cards and I play a lousy hand
I celebrate no victories and my promises are sand
Against all this I contrast you, when all is lost the war is through
Hey angel, dare the winds now we can fly

This day will die tonight and there ain't no exception
Why should I wait for nothing to wait for
Let me love you in this fable, hold your heart in my hand
Our time is waiting right outside your door
And maybe tomorrow is a better day

This day will die tonight and there ain't no exception
Why should I wait for nothing to wait for
I won't cry for my solitude, lay my head and dream of you
And hope that you'll come knocking on my door
And maybe tomorrow is a better day
I know tomorrow is a better day

Suck up social members
Have you realized the patience given not given back?
Working, Ready-made fix-it-quick
Years of little gain
Push me too far blind bats it will never end

Know money
Life is plenty funny
For all you hard working people the day never ends

Multi-vitamins tea bags vitamin see in me
Anxious pee-ons rule-by-law
Laced with E, Laze-ery
Hold on my foot in your mouth
Taste the asphalt
Slobbery wet smokers breathe for you
And now I'm breathing you


I want to feel like the man who never lost his soul
Took advice 'cause I thought I could've had it all
Didn't know that a better life was possible
Impossible?

I could feel like the kid who never lost his soul
Take advice and believe that it's attainable
You could say that a better life is possible
Impossible...



You're making me feel like a dream, the way you flatter me 
Are you just another fake, or something special? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah 
You're telling me that I'm too cool, you say I'm beautiful 
I gotta tell you I'm no fool, I'm kinda cynical 
Boy have you got what it takes 
Something special yeah, yeah, yeah 


Don't think this beauty's skin deep 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
I need more than you're giving me 
Skin deep 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Get down to the bone 
Heart and soul, I've got to have it all 
It's got to be special special 
You sit me on the top of your world, can't take your eyes off me 
You say that I'm your baby girl, well that's oh so sweet 
Boy have you got what it takes 
Something special yeah, yeah, yeah 


Down, down, take it to the bone 
Get to the beauty within 
Down, down, take it to the bone 
Got to discover me 
Down, down, take it to the bone 
Open your mind and come in 
Down, down, take it to the bone



a second,
a half-life,
a minus,
a segment,
a blinder,
elective detention.
It's secession time,
paid for by cutting backwards.
It's election time,
letting every insult become presidential injury.

I'm begging you just hold my head up
This last disgrace,
breathe in my face,
bleed in distaste,
bless this amen.

It's secession time,

Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman

Ahh, she's somethin' to see
When it comes to lovin', she's wild and free
If I had to replace her, it would take two or three
'Cause she's the woman that was born for me
If she left me, I'd hang from the nearest oak tree

Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman

I'm talkin' bout my kinda woman
She's somethin' to see
She never sets foot in the kitchen 
But she sure cooks for me, yeah

Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman

I'm talkin' bout my kinda woman
She's somethin' to see
Woe to the person who crosses her path
She sees right through them, they see their last

Yeah
This is for you, baby

'Cause she's the one who holds my hand
And she don't have to break no bread
She's the one who always knows
She's got my heart and I love her so

Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman

Oh, be still my beating heart



Chained in the cottage at night
Killed the overseer, broke down the door
Now they gonna shoot us on sight
Night time sticking to the 'B' roads
Hiding from the men with the guns
Hitting the ditches
Everytime somebody comes
 
Every single house has been looted
Every single city's been burned
Every can of food has been opened
Every single stone has been turned
Found this Parka on a deadman
Jamie got a couple of knives
Countryside crawling with maniacs
You gotta survive
 
Carrion crows on the motorway
Old woman dying of the plague
She cried 'put me out of my misery'
Charlie had to give her his blade
Streets full of slavers on the rampage
Wild boys running by the score
Weeks without eating
Can't carry on anymore



My edges are folding

Return Me to the paper back section

this we know my friends
I thought you knew where to go
but you were following me
so lets get lost in space
i feel this place
I'm stuck in the rat race
it's a lovely day to lose your way
and get stuck in the loop.....

over and over again, you could never make it stop x4

my old bones stroll along
railway track is oh so long
stem the tide, the nine to five
slowly eating me alive
but all night long, carry on
we're stumbling slowly to a lovely day to lose your way
and get stuck in the loop.....

over and over again, you could never make it stop x4



My mother says
She felt twenty angels
That came through the window and helped him to fly
My sisters wept and I stepped
Further from faith

The most beautiful sky turned to grey
But hey, the memories seem real
It's been years since I've prayed 
Still insisting
That I don't want to feel
Like you feel 

I set it all on fire
And watched the walls collapse
I stand alone and tired
Now I want it back
And even if everyone is a liar
I don't want to be
Within this silent choir

I want to believe
In something
I want to believe in something

When I close my eyes
Will they come for me
Will you not believe that I
I've learned how to fly
Will I still be singing
Somewhere in heaven

I wonder if angels can cry
I hope they come for me
I hope I see something
I hope that I
Walk into the white light
Walk into the white light

I set it all on fire
And watched the walls collapse
I stand alone and tired
Now I want it back
Even if everyone is a liar
I don't want to be
Within this silent choir

I want to believe
In something
In something

I want to believe
To believe in something
I said I

I set it all on fire
And watched the walls collapse
I stand alone and tired
Now I want it back
And even if everyone is a liar
I don't want to be
Within this silent choir

I want to believe
I want to believe in something
I want to believe in something
I want to believe in something 
But God closed her eyes

I want to believe in something
I want to believe in something
I want to believe in something 
But God closed her eyes

I want to believe in something
I want to believe in something
I want to believe in something 
But God closed her eyes

We all want to believe in something
I want to believe
In something



I wanted you so much
I really thought that you were different, oh I 
Couldn't get enough
I tried to save you from yourself 
I felt every high and low
But the lows have drowned the highs away 
Now there's no where else to go

Black rose your thorns are cutting into me 
For the last time
Black rose I watched your petals wilt away 
I couldn't bring you back to life

You were always where the sun could never go
I never wanted that you to have to be alone
But I couldn't find a way to help you grow
Black rose

You never tell me how you feel
And your moods they always change
I really tried to make it real, but you
Never had the faith
I tried to give you something good 
To take the pain away
I tried to make you understand 
You don't have to be this way

Black rose your thorns are cutting into me 
For the last time
Black rose I watched your petals wilt away 
I couldn't bring you back to life

You were always where the sun could never go
I never wanted that you to have to be alone
But I couldn't find a way to help you grow
Black rose

I'm not the one who hurt you I couldn't save you
So why are you so scared? you are, who you are
All that you've been put to I couldn't break through
Through couldn't be repaired we're too far apart
I'm not the one who hurt you I couldn't save you
I'm the only one who cares you are, who you are
You'll need someone to turn to I couldn't save you
And I will not be there

Every time I held you 
I knew that it would hurt
Only through the pain 
I could find a way to learn

Black rose your thorns are cutting into me 
For the last time
Black rose I watched your petals wilt away 
So wilt away 
Couldn't bring you back to life

You were always where the sun could never go
I never wanted that you to have to be alone
But I couldn't find a way to help you to grow
Black rose

I'm not the one who hurt you I couldn't save you
So why are you so scared? you are, who you are
All that you've been put through I couldn't break through
Couldn't be repaired we're too far apart
I'm not the one who hurt you I couldn't save you
I'm the only one who cares you are, who you are
You'll need someone to turn to I couldn't save you
And I will not be there



And get your pigtail down
And get your heart beatin' baby
Got my timin' right 
I got my act all tight

Your Momma says you don't
And your Daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time

Tie your Mother down

Lock your Daddy out of doors

Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys

I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin'

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick that's all right
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

Your Mommy and your Daddy
Gonna plague me till I die
They can't understand it
I'm just a peace lovin' guy

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Get that big big big big big big
Daddy out the door
Tie your Mother down yeah
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

Give me every inch of your love



Remain
Close to me
A no good-bye suicide mystery

The rat
In your brain
Turns a wheel
Connected to your guts and
All your faults are in me
And all your faults in me

What would you say
If we lived on TV
Besides all the things they told you to
And all the things they told you to
And all the things they told you to
And all the things they told you to

We're stuck
Inside our own machine
Apparitions
Apparitions
Apparitions

Say hello
Well is it strange
Where you are
Where you used to be kind of free
Are they laughing at you
Laughing at you

The rat
In your brain
Rules the world
From the comfort of your living room
Tell me are we leaving soon
The comfort of your living room
Tell me are we leaving soon

We're stuck
Inside our own machine
Apparitions
Apparitions
Apparitions

We're stuck
Inside our own machine
Apparitions

And I can testify that that's the truth, 
I had it all and didn't know how to use it,
I was so stupid - it was right before my eyes.

Yeah, now I've been lookin' all my life, 
Waiting for the perfect time, 
Never knew that I would find it, 
Right back where I started from, 
Why'd I have to go so far, 
When everything was where you are, 
How'd I know that you'd be waitin', 
Right back where I started from. 

Who can tell ya where the river's flowin',
Just ride the wave - let it take ya down, 
All the twists and turns I navigated,
It's so frustratin', that you were there all the time,
Yeah all the time.

Now I've been lookin' all my life, 
Waiting for the perfect time, 
Never knew that I would find it, 
Right back where I started from, 
Why'd I have to go so far, 
When everything was where you are, 
How'd I know that you'd be waitin', 
Right back where I started from,
Oh where I started from,
Ahh I started from here.

I know where I'm headed to - it's right back where I've been,

I've been looking all my life,
Waiting for the perfect time,
Never knew that I would find it,
Right back where I started from,
Ohh why'd I have to go so far,
When everything was where you are,
How'd I know that you be waiting,
Right back where I started from,
Yeah where I started from,
Oh where I started from - Yeah,
Right back there.



And she don't know
He's got her best friend on the phone
She'll wash her hair
His dirty clothes
Are all he gives to her

And he's got posters on the wall
Of all the girls he wished she was
And he means everything to her

Her boyfriend
He don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned
Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the week

It's Friday night
And she's all alone
He's a million miles away
She's dressed to kill
The TV's on
He's connected to the sound

And he's got pictures on the wall
Of all the girls he's loved before
And she knows all his favorite songs

Her boyfriend
He don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned
Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the week
Yeah!

Her boyfriend
He don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned
He's too stoned
He's too stoned
He's too stoned

Her boyfriend
He don't know
Anything about her 
He's too stoned
Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the week

Yeah she's the flavor of the week
She makes me weak



what will you give ?
made it round and circled it
stamped my form into the ground
beneath it I lit a fire sinkiller
where is it ?
it's at your feet
where will we meet ?
ohh not in the pit where the fire is lit
hot foot it
hot foot it up above...
what will I find there?
What will I find there?
your naked sprite
your dried up spit - your eyes gone blind
your faithfull mind
beneath god's heel it's one long grind
beneath god's heel it's one long grind
up above that's my trick
hot foot it
hot foot it
hot foot it up above, hey sinkiller up above



Except if that someone's me
I washed my hands but just the same
My eyes confess for me

I come in filthy rags
You know I am guilty

I wake up almost every night
Saying Your name
What I would give to walk in the light
But what I hide has made me lame

My face down on the ground
I wait to hear the healing sound

You break through my deafness
Swing open the curtain
And I find the courage
To get up and walk

I forget my weakness
For You've answered my loneliness
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see my hope has come

You'll have to show me where to go
It's been so long since I've used my feet
I got up today a cripple
And now I'm dancing

So let the power of Your move
Not stop with what I can see

You break through my deafness
Swing open the curtain
And I find the courage
To get up and walk

I forget my weakness
For You've answered my loneliness
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see my hope has come

Ooh, ooh, yeah, I couldn't walk
Ooh, I couldn't sing
Ooh, oh, I couldn't love
Until You found me

In my deafness
Swing open the curtain
And I found the courage
To get up and walk

Oh, I forget my weakness
For You've answered my loneliness
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see

You break through my deafness
Swing open the curtain
And I find the courage
To get up and walk

Oh, I forget my weakness
For You've answered my loneliness
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see

Through the mud on my eyes
I can see
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see my hope has come, yeah



I'll never live it with you
And every time there's a gift worth giving 
You won't let me give it to you

When everything was right  Oh Oh
Now everything seems wrong  Oh Oh
The last words spoken

I found another way
I found another way
I found another way
And I want you notice

Empty houses are full of promise
So many things you can do
And every time that the phone starts ringing
I can't help but think that it's you.

When everything was right  Oh Oh
Now everything seems wrong  Oh Oh
The last words spoken

I found another way
I found another way
I found another way
And I want you notice

When everything was right  Oh Oh
Now everything seems wrong  Oh Oh
The last words spoken

I found another way
I found another way
I found another way
And I want you notice



About madness, lust and a female
Dad's a ghost and he roams the floors
Lurks at night in Elsinore
Got a pale face just like Kiss paint, normal you know this ain't
Something is rotten up in Denmark, a sick mistake
My Uncle Claudius, his alibi is fishy
Suspicions of murder because he's acting hella shifty
Frailty - thy name is woman because my mom's on his D
A-N-I-S-H throne my Dad's ghost tells me
"Swear swear, swear, to revenge my regicide,
Claudius iced me one night, under my crown he tries to hide
So Hamlet here's your mission: use your antic disposition
Make them think you're crazy, bring justice fuse the fission"
Meanwhile my girl Ophelia is goth as hell
Keeps a razor by her wrist, rocks out to Soft Cell
This girl has got more issues than Amy Winehouse
I'm like get thee to a nunnery,  I'm not trying to find a spouse... and she says:

"Screw that forget about that I don't want to think about anything like that 
Screw that forget about that I don't want to know about anything like that"


I've got nothing to do 
but hang around and get screwed up on you  forget it though 
I've got nothing to do 
but hang around and get screwed up on you just let it go

I'm an emo prince, non-committal as could be
You'd be non-committal too if you were flawed like me
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are on my back and I've had it
I've got these players down from Norway let them practice in the attic
I'll have them reenact the murder, watch my uncle's expression
The play's the thing to catch the king and teach him a lesson
My uncle freaks out at the play I know he did it just like OJ
Can't 187 while he prays because Hamlet won't play that way nope!
Confront my mom throw her down on the bed
Because this Oedipus complex has got me stressed in the head
Then I killed my girlfriend's dad, he was spying now he's dead
I screamed at my mom while the blood made the carpet turn red
See kings lose crowns but princes stay intelligent
R. Kelly has girl problems?  this is drama, that's irrelevant
Ophelia bursts in throwing columbines and daises
Singing songs about virginity gone - she's honest but she's crazy

And she says

"Screw that forget about that I don't want to think about anything like that 
Screw that forget about that I don't want to know about anything like that"


I've got nothing to do 
but hang around and get screwed up on you  you've got to see
I've got nothing to do 
but hang around and get screwed up on you  not you it's me


We've got clowns in the graveyard and I'm talking to skulls
We've got murder and incest, who said Shakespeare was dull?
My girlfriend took her life, and I'm like "Goodness gracious"
Her brother wants to duel - Laertes is too pugnacious
My uncle dipped the tip of the saber in poison  duel time
Then he poisoned the cup that mom started enjoyin'   tool time	
I got stabbed with the poison sword, then I stabbed my girlfriend's brother
and then I stabbed my uncle and we've all killed each other
To be or not to be?  Well  I guess that solves that one
And I would have stayed in Wittgenberg if I'd known that this would happen
If you're ever up in Denmark on a moonlit night
You'll hear Ophelia's sad song when the full moon's bright
Baby I'm sorry I messed up, good night my sweet princess
May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest

and they sing


I've got nothing to do 
but hang around and get screwed up on you  forget it though 
I've got nothing to do 
but hang around and get screwed up on you just let it go

I've got nothing to do 
but hang around and get screwed up on you  you've got to see
I've got nothing to do 
but hang around and get screwed up on you  not you it's me



he turns and laughter flickers in his eyes
intent and direct when he speaks
I watch his lips

when he drives I love to watch his hands
white, smooth, almost feminine
almost American
I love to watch him

in his face age descends on youth
exaggeration on the truth
he caught me looking then but soon his eyes forgot me
and everything he seems to do
reflects just another shade of blue
I saw her searching into you and ached a while

I watch his lips caress the glass
his finger stroke its stem and pass
to lift a cigarette at last
he dries his eyes
from the shadows by the stairs
I watch as he weeps unaware
that i'm in awe of his despair

in his face age descends on youth
exaggeration on the truth
he caught me looking then but soon his eyes forgot me
and everything he seems to do
reflects just another shade of blue
I saw her searching into you and ached a while



In a line
Saying hey good morning
So fine
Singing Oh Security
So good
Sticks and Stones and Tombs of Burning wood
Sticks and Stones and Tombs of Burning wood

Now that's a fire
A big bonfire
A big 3 - storey mansion
It's a smouldering pyre
He loves her
It clicks
When I ski I jump for womens tricks
Snug interior
The hand of God
So much dirty laundry
In their backyard
Ooh possessions
If you could

Sticks and Stones and Tombs of Burning wood
Sticks and Stones and Tombs of Burning wood
Sticks and Stones and Tombs of Burning wood

Never did I believe
There could be such happiness
Feels like nothing on earth
Started with one little kiss

I could stay in this moment forever
I could reach every star in the sky
I could lose myself when I look
Into your eyes

Is this happening? Is this fantasy?

All my dreams coming true
All because of you
I can't believe its true
All because of you

You are everything I
Wanted for so many years
Goodbye long, lonely nights
Sadness and thousands of tears

I could stay in this moment forever
I could reach every star in the sky
I could lose myself when I look
Into your eyes

Is this happening? Is this fantasy?

All my dreams coming true
All because of you
I can't believe its true
All because of you

Is this happening? Is this fantasy?

All my dreams coming true
All because of you
I can't believe its true
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you



Oh yeah Oh yeah
I am waiting, I am waiting
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere

You can't hold out, you can't hold out
Oh yeah Oh yeah
You can't hold out, you can't hold out
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere

See it come along
Don't know where it's from
Oh yes you will find out
Like a winter storm
Fear will pierce your bones
You'll find out

Slow or fast, slow or fast
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Slow or fast, slow or fast 
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere

See it come along
Don't know where it's from

i want you to see what i see 
i want you to help me across the line 
i want you to read my mind 

all i want is a little love 
heaven and stars above 

i want you to come out and get it right 
i know you came close but not quite 
and now the flowers are in bloom 
and the song is called dust my broom 

what are you trying to say 
all i want is a little love 
heaven and stars above 
what are you gonna give me 
all i want is a little love 
heaven and stars above 

you know where the ocean 
meets the sky 
we'll unzip and we'll fly 
do you know what i feel 
i think we've got something real 

what are you trying to say 
all i want is a little love 
i can't hear you 
heaven and stars above 
what are you gonna give me 
all i want is a little love 
heaven and stars above



Just as the bluffs are hills the gulf's a sea, the sky's the limit we meet. Horizons on the palms and leaves, the waves reflect the blues and greens.. Sink or swim, drive or die, find a coast, stay alive. A Northern source will feed us now, but we'll all end up at the river's mouth. 

You know what they say about passing ships? They're old ladies, in leopard print. Who've lived their lives, with telescopes. Who've made mistakes, but are now too old.



There's no more air
Tripping over myself, going nowhere
Waiting, suffocating, no direction
I took a dive and

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down 
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

Been wondering why it's only me
Have you always been inside waiting to breathe
It's alright, sunlight on my face
I wake up and yet, I'm alive 'cuz

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down 
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

I was so afraid of going under
But now, the weight of the world 
Feels like nothing, no nothing
down, down, down
You're all I wanted
down, down, down
You're all I needed
down, down, down
You're all I wanted
You're all I needed

And I won't forget the way you loved me
All that I wanted, all that I needed now

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down 
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you



Let's go to a rave
And behave like we're trippin'
Simply 'cause we're so in love

Funny hats, shiny pants -
All we need for some romance
Go get dolled-up and I'll pick you up

There's no line for you and me
'Cause tonight we're V.I.P.
I know somebody at the door

I see that twinkle in your eye
You shake that ass and I just die
Let's check our coats and move out to the floor

When I'm dancing with you
Tomorrow doesn't matter
Turn that music up
'Till the windows start to shatter
'Cause you're the only one
Who can get me on my feet
And I can't even dance

Just look at me, Silly Me
I'm as happy as can be - 
I got a girl who thinks I rock

And tomorrow there's no school
So lets go drink some more Red Bull
And not get home 'till about 6:00

When I'm dancing with you
Tomorrow doesn't matter
Turn that music up
'Till the windows start to shatter
'Cause you're the only one
Who can get me on my feet
And I can't even dance

Everybody here is staring
At the outfit that you're wearing -
I Love it when they check you out
Cover's only twenty bucks
And even if the DJ sucks
It's time to turn this mutha out!

When we're together, when we're together
There's no tomorrow, is no tomorrow
When we're together
There's no one in the world
But you and me
Oh you and me
Oh you and me



I'm standing on the porch
He told me not to wait up
He'd be back by four

I feel sort of fuzzy again
I feel sort of fuzzy again
You know me very well
You know me very well
You know me very well

Chime in forget me nots
He's waiting by the door
I told him not to wait up
I'd be back before

I feel sort of fuzzy again
I feel sort of fuzzy again
You know me very well
You know me very well
You know me very well

& so you
Walk when I'm talking
Here we talk when you're walking
It's no fun
When I'm talking to myself
You know me better than you think you do



Let us come clean
Before you leave town
Let's write something down

I don't want it all
I just want what's mine
While you're still around
Let's write something down

Would you care to know
Would you care to know
That I forgot someone like you
Would you care to know
Would you care to know
That it wasn't hard to do

Let's write something down
Let's gather our troops
Before you leave town
Let's write something down

I don't wanna fight
I wanna make up
While you're still around
Let's write something down



I know what you mean 
I answer by questioning 
All that I need 

And I want you to surrender 
I want you to see 
All the signs 
All the faces 
Inside of me 

I see I'm not perfect 
But that's all I see 
Lost in a portrait 
In a picture of me 
This can't be everything I see 
Then my canvas is incomplete 
Your color's everything to me 
And my canvas will set me free 

My outline is solid 
And made up of crying 
And the things that you say 
Just burn in my eyes 
I want to, to surrender 
I want you to find 
Some comfort in the spaces 
Between the lines 

I see I'm not perfect 
But that's all I see 
Lost in a portrait 
In a picture of me 
This can't be everything I see 
Then my canvas is incomplete 
Your color's everything to me 
And my canvas will set me free 

This can't be everything I see 
Then my canvas is incomplete 
Your color is everything to me  

This can't be everthing I see 
Then my canvas is incomplete 
Your color is everything to me 
And my canvas will set me free 

This can't be everthing I see 
Then my canvas is incomplete 
Your color is everything to me 

You're everything to me



What can I say this is where I want to stay, taking time, trying to find, a cheaper way to spend my time. And you'll say its not enough.

And as the needle plays the tune, the guitar chords cry out to you. Speaking in all honesty, thoughts you can't deny. How's it feel inside?

What can I say this is where I want to stay, taking time, trying to find, a cheaper way to spend my time. And you'll say its not enough.



Oh yeah

You ain't got music if you ain't got the muscle, oh yeah
Ain't seen nothin' 'til you're down and you're rotten, oh yeah
You ain't got nothing until you hit rock bottom
Oh yeah
You ain't got music if you ain't got the muscle, oh yeah
You ain't seen nothing until you're down and you're rotten, oh yeah
You ain't got nothing until you hit rock bottom
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Well, the boys keep swinging, the girls keep bringing
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah



Scattered pages document the decline
Accrued experience a crude reminder of the mistakes
Struck a balance striking nerves, giving chase
What's the sense in argument? I'm on the last line
With conviction, polishing what's defined
Accrued experience a crude reminder of the forecast
Struck a balance, lost the nerve, the last gasp
I spent too much time waiting for you only to find mirrors
Spent to much time following you only to find mirrors
A skeleton's beautiful hands
Oh, what's left to do but die?
In Irvine what's there to do?
It's only a mirage
If you go, who'll be waiting for you?
Oh, what's left to do but die?



We're gonna party harder right after the door
We'll be singing and carrying on until the .. are gone

We'll be living, laughing, .. on Saturday night
Saturday night, we got the feeling
Saturday night, we can't believe it
Saturday night, we got the feeling, a feeling it's right
Oh Saturday night

Let not mistaken the love that we're making tonight
You're back on my shell when the magic is heavying right
We're gonna let all the limbos speak
We're gonna jump up and down the street

We'll be living, laughing, .. on Saturday night
Saturday night, we got the feeling
Saturday night, we can't believe it
Saturday night, we got the feeling, a feeling it's right
Oh Saturday night, Saturday night, it's a feeling we know
Saturday night, it's a time to let go
Saturday night, it's a feeling we know
It's a time to let go

We'll be cruising and boosing and taking all over the bars
We're looking for glittery girlies, who may be our stars
I've been looking for someone like you
For any good looker man do
For living, laughter, .. on Saturday night

Saturday night, we got the feeling
Saturday night, we can't believe it
Saturday night, we got the feeling, a feeling we know
It's a time to let go
Saturday night, it's a feeling
Saturday night, it's believing



And that's where I belong
Show me a place where I don't have to hurry
And that's where I belong
Give me the time, so I can change my mind
Where it don't matter if I'm wrong
Show me a place where I don't have to worry
And that's where I belong

Show me a place where I don't have to worry
And that's where I belong
Show me a place where I don't have to hurry
And that's where I belong

One thing I like about that gal of mine
One thing I like about that gal of mine
She treats me right and loves me all the time

She walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
She walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
She walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
And this she said to every man she met

Mister change a dollar – gimme a lousy dime
Mister change a dollar – gimme a lousy dime
Mister change a dollar – gimme a lousy dime
So I can fee that hungry man of mine

Sometimes I'm broke and blue as I can be
Sometimes I'm broke and blue as I can be
Sometimes I'm broke and blue as I can be
But still my baby she looks after me

That gal of mine she's one way all the time
That gal of mine she's one way all the time
That gal of mine she's one way all the time
She takes the blues away and satisfies my mind

That gal of mine she's one way all the time

That gal of mine she's one way all the time



I just need contemplation over you
I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

Just think how long I've known you
It's wrong for me to own you, lock and key
It's really not confusing
I'm just the young illusion, can't you see

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

I just need contemplation over you
I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you

You should have taken me,
It was so damn cold I should'a held ya,
'cause you were shakin' me. 

Well, I almost had a question,
When she led me home,
I spent too much time for one night,
Bein' alone.

She said you're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me,
You're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me.

I should have got the Rambler,
Back seat movie for two,
I spent too much time for one night,
Bein' alone with you. 

You should have seen her daddy,
'cause he said she had to go,
I spent too much time for one night,
Bein' all alone.

She said you're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me,
You're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me.

You're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me,
You're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me.

You're wastin' time,
Oh you're takin' a chance on me,
She said you're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me.



She's perfect, tempary nails and fake lashes, eyes she catches
Shes like a code but all the way she has being made of plastic
He's a rock 'n' roll, out of control, why does he like me better?
She's hollywood and i'm no good but he's not trying to swag her

She's in my ear like heres the thing
Girls like you have no chance with him

Oh no you can't have everything you want
And theres nothing you can do about it
Oh no you can't have everything you see
And theres nothing you can do about me

Uh uh

He's just so different from the other boys i've met around
His heads' not in the clouds and his feet are on the ground
I guess he likes the way i rock my hood, he likes my swager
She could have any other guy here so whats the matter

She's in my ear like heres the thing
Girls like you have no chance with him

My oh my well i guess i fooled you all

Uh

Oh no you can't have everything you want
And theres nothing you can do about it
Oh no you can't have everything you see
And theres nothing you can do about 

Oh no you can't have everything you want
And theres nothing you can do about it
Oh no you can't have everything you see
And theres nothing you can do about me

Then he took his hands, sliped it round my waist 
You should have seen the look on her face
Can't believe this is happening to me
Oh please
When she walked by she pushed me 
And i just stood there for a while
And i turned around, looked her in the eye
And i just mocked

She's that girl, girl with a body
The guys in the club all say shes a hottie
I'm not, and i guess i'm ok with that, cause i no i'm just a girl and i think i want it bad

Oh no you can't have everything you want
And theres nothing you can do about it
Oh no you can't have everything you see
And theres nothing you can do about 

Oh no you can't have everything you want
And theres nothing you can do about it
Oh no you can't have everything you see
And theres nothing you can do about me

Lalalalala repeated



Throws itself off into oblivion
As the sky goes so complacent
Then spits a little compassion
Dusk approaches the city's carnivorous
Monster sweat like it wants to eat us
And devour everything but this mouth
Sings of the glorious feeders

Tucked deep inside the wraths of blood

Everywhere it seems like there's a memory
Sometimes memories kill me
As I travel the avenues and the streets
And shadow valleys of this fuckin city
Everyday it seem to love a little less
Seemed enough to chew on my calmness
And drive me to the end of myself

Where rivers dispose of me

You're like a man without skin
Everything that touches seems to hurt him
And he says maybe I'm just a person
But I'll be for you if you let me

All I want is animals to be free
Run around and fuck right out in the street
Maybe they are gonna want to eat me
But I'll try not to take it personally
And is there no love in this city?
Can someone have just a little pity?

You're like a man without skin
Everything that touches seems to hurt him
And he says maybe I'm just a person
But I'll be for you if you let me

Just like a man without skin
Everything he sees seems to touch him
And he says, as the water washes over me
I'll stand alone let God make it trade

Come on baby
Penetrate me
You go so deep
So deep in me
Is there no love
In this city
Can someone have just a little pity?

'Cause we're tucked deep inside the wraths of blood
We're tucked so deep inside the wraths of blood

You're like a man without skin
Everything that touches seems to hurt him
And he says baby I'm just a person
But I'll be for you if you let me

Just like a man without skin
Everything he sees seems to touch him
And he says that the one who watches over me
I'll stand alone let God make it trade

Penetrate me
Penetrate me

Can you see the line where the water ends?
Throws itself off into oblivion
As the sky goes so complacent
Then spits a little compassion



the well was full - still there's nothing to drink
I got some money, but still it don't add up
how a girl like this can spend her life drinking from an empty cup
oh she's lost, la-la-la-lost

I got a friend who works too much
trying hard to find the end to the means
came from nothing, got nothing to lose
except he's losing sight of what is true in all his busy life
that boy's lost, la-la-la-lost
that boy's lost, la-la-la-la-lost

Maybe it's me but I can't see why
sometimes we choose to be blind
looking away, going day by day and
stumbling around in the dark

Spend our lives wasting time
running hard, still behind
so afraid of slowing down
gotta stop and take a look around and see what can be found
we're so lost, la-la-la-lost
lost, la-la-la-la-lost



The drums on 
We pound it out on floor toms
Our psalms are sing-along songs

This old town is lifeless
Been that way our whole lives, just
Work at the mill until you die
Work at the mill and then you die

We're gonna build something this summer


We'll put it back together
Raise up a giant ladder
With love and trust and friends and hammers


We're gonna lean this ladder
Up against the water tower
Climb up to the top and drink and talk


Me and my friends are like
Double whiskey, Coke no ice
We drink along in double time
Might drink too much but we feel fine

We're gonna build something this summer


Summer grants us all the power
To drink on top of water towers
With love and trust and shows all summer


Let this be my annual reminder
That we could all be something bigger

I went to your schools, I did my detention
But the walls were so gray that I couldn't pay attention
I read your gospel, it moved me to tears
But I couldn't find the hate and I couldn't find the fear

I met your saviour, I knelt at his feet
And he took my ten bucks and he went down the street
I tried to believe all the things that you said
But my friends that aren't dying are already dead

Raise a toast to Saint Joe Strummer
I think he might have been our only decent teacher
Getting older makes it harder to remember
We are our only saviours
We're gonna build something this summer



Picking up magic that grows at his feet.
She says the same her peculiar way
Dreaming good fortune on everyone's street.

Say, hey, have you heard, blue whiskey's the rage,
I'll send you a jug in the morning.
It is absurd to live in a cage,
You know there's got to be something better.

As they go by, don't look with eagle's eyes
Smile on your jailers until they grow weak.
Nothing can compare to something that's almost there
To tear up the madness that all of us seek.

Say, hey, have you heard, blue whiskey's the rage,
I'll send you a jug in the morning.
It is absurd to live in a cage,
You know there's got to be something better.



Is a heart that’s bleeding
Underneath that heart
I’m waiting, I’m praying
Can You really feel what I’m feeling?
‘Cause this world don’t ask
It takes, it’s stealing

Can You feel this heart?
It’s beating
Like a drum it’s beating
It’s calling out to You
Will You come and rain on this desert heart
Like only You can do
Can hear this soul?
It’s crying
My soul is crying
Calling out to You
Will You come and wash over me
Like only You can do

Will You be my freedom
Will You be my freedom

When I am tempted
To crawl back and hide my face
Will You wrap me up
With love, truth and grace
How’d I become the mess that I have made?
I’m afraid to look You in the eye
Because of my shame

How beautiful it is
It is
How wonderful to be
Set free

Can hear this soul?
It’s crying
My soul is crying
Calling out to You
Will You come and wash over me
Like only You can do

Will You be my freedom
Will You be my freedom
Will You be my freedom
You are my freedom



Leave me alone just for one more day

Please,
Leave me alone just for one more day

Oh ah

Please,
Leave me alone just for one more day

Please,
Leave me alone just for one more day




It aint your T.V. Though it's fun to laugh at people sometimes.
It aint your computer. Though it's nice to spend a whole night on line.
It's not your movies. I see the same dam storyline.
It's only music now. 
It's only music now.

I'm not alone.
I wish I was.
cause then I'd know.
I was down because.
I couldn't find a friend around.
To love me like they do right now.
They do right now.

I'm dizzy from the shopping malls.
I searched for my joy, but I turned it off.
It doesn't help the hunger pains.
In a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate.

Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it.
Something's missing and I don't know what it is.
No I don't know what it is at all.

When autumn comes it doesn't ask.
It just walks in where it left you last.
You'll never know when it starts.
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart.


Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it.
Something's missing and I don't know what it is.
No I don't know what it is at all.

I can't be sure that this state of mind is not of my own design.
I wish there was an over-the-counter test for my loneliness.
For my loneliness.
Like this.

Something missing and I don't know how I'm gonna fix it.
Something missing and I don't know what it is.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Something's different and I don't know what it is.
No I don't know what it is.

Friends-check
Money-check
Well slept-check
Opposite sex-check
Guitar-check
Microphone-check
Messages waiting on me when I come home.

And I don't know what it is.
No I don't know what it is at all.



I realise that it's all around
So we play our part in what's happening
and what happens to you then happens to me
and it's all around

And the song sings all around me
I'll let faith hold its fantasy
as the song sings all around me
you can steal what you love
you can love what you steal

One goes to heaven, one goes to hell
like a national myth that is all around me
and we couldn't find the rivers and mountains
they were not on the map
but true places never are
they're only inside you and me

And the song sings all around me
I'll let faith hold its fantasy
as the song sings all, all around me
you can steal what you love
but you can't love what you steal



Ohh - Try to see it my way. 

Well, I know you'll cover up,
From all the things you did that tied you up,
Ohh, Just wanna let you know,
That I wanna keep you warm,
Until the sun warms up the dawn,
So baby move in a little closer,
Then you can think it over.

Just try to see it my way,
Just try to see it my way.

Well, you said you needed time,
From all the things that run around your mind,
How can I let you know,
That I wanna keep you warm,
Until the sun warms up the dawn,
And baby move in a little closer,
Then you can think it over.

Try to see it my way,
Try to see it my way, if you can,
Just try to see it my way, oh my way,
Just try to see it my way.

Ohh, just try to see it my way,
Try to see it my way,
Well baby, baby, baby,
Just try to see it my way, if you can,
Just try to see it my way, try to see it my way.



Half are getting sprung and half are going back in
There ain't no getting through to Gideon
He lost his mind when they jumped him in

Say a prayer for sweet Charlemagne
He had the pigs at the door
He put the drugs down the drain
He's gonna have to come up with seven grand some other way

The gangster disciples knocked me off of my bicycle
It was midnight down by Selby & Griggs
I shouldn't have gone down there but it was too late to switch
You gotta dance with who you came with

You gotta go with what got you there
I came with chipped teeth and some bleached blond hair
You gotta make due with what they gave to you
They took ten bucks and my tennis shoes

So say a prayer for the boys in the band
I was out of my head so it was out of my hands
White wine and some tallboy cans
They powered up and they proceeded to jam man

Hit it again on the south side of the gym
And my one friend got two girls in a twist
I got stuck with some priss that went and sliced up her wrists
But you know you gotta dance with who you came to the dance with



Deep inside my castle walls,
Spend my nights with concubine-
Wasted, unchaste, drunk on blood red wine.
Being the king was pretty cool,
I'd have to say that ruling ruled
And I'd be in throne still
Had I not one day fallen ill.

I spit and I coughed,
My vision went soft
And my chest got tight.
My court, they surrounded me,
They gagged and bounded me
And threw me out into the night.

Out in the mud I sadly sighed,
The waiting crowd laid and died.
There came a noise boisterous
From down in the cloisters
And I heard them call the cry;

"Draw up the drawbridge, draw down the blinds!
Everyone inside is getting high tonight!
Waiting for the plague to move on,
No one's getting sober till the liquor's all gone!"

The bra in the candelabra,
The panties on the paintings,
The Monks have tapped their finest cask,
And the Nuns are into fainting. They sing,

"I hold my breath, you hit my chest."

You stumble from the arms of the one
What made you, didn't you?
Fumble to the palms of the one
What pays you, didn't you?



Both you and I have always kept it bottled up inside
Can you show me what it feels like feels like
To give yourself away?

Why can't I hold onto you? 
There's noone around
Who picks me up when I'm down
Like you do

Why can't I hold onto you? 
And when you can't hear a sound 
Will the silence drown you too?

Who's going home with you tonight?
Was it real or am I part of your collection?
Have you crossed the line?
Who's going home with you tonight?
Oh, I feel that you're an open invitation, is this 
How we say 
Goodbye?

Keeping secrets somewhere down below down below
I wish you had the heart to tell me that you sold your soul
So many things you couldn't let me know let me know
You had to run away

Why can't I hold onto you?
There's no one around
Who picks me up when I'm down
Like you do

Why can't I hold onto you?
And when you can't hear a sound
Will the silence drown you too?

Who's going home with you tonight?
Was it real or am I part of your collection?
Have you crossed the line?
Who's going home with you tonight?
Oh, I feel that you're an open invitation, is this 
How we say 
Goodbye? who's going home with you tonight? 
Goodbye? who's going home with you tonight?
Can you tell me what is wrong and what is right?
Who's going home with you tonight?

Why can't I hold onto you? 
Why can't I hold onto you?
Why can't I hold onto you?

It's getting harder to sit here alone
And I've been waiting, I've been waiting, and you still ain't home
I have never ever felt so low
And I've been thinking, I've been thinking of where did you go?

Who's going home with you tonight?
Was it real or am I part of your collection?
Have you crossed the line?
Who's going home with you tonight?
Oh, I feel that you're an open invitation, is this 
How we say 
Goodbye? who's going home with you tonight? 
Goodbye? who's going home with you tonight?
Can you tell me what is wrong and what is right?
Who's going home with you tonight?



That is driving you insane
And lost your trust in chemicals
To forget the end is near

Oh, the fire lost it's warmth
And it seems we'll freeze to death
We'll hold each other then
When it's time, time to lose it all
'Cause then we're free

And you fell off another cliff
Next time you'll lose your luck
And when you think: another test
Life has just begun

Oh, we're swallowed by the earth
And it seems we won't come back
We'll hold each other then
When it's time, time to lose it all
'Cause then we're free

Oh, let it all go by
It is time to prove yourself wrong
And everyone goodbye
'Cause it's time, time to lose it all
And then we're free



weathered my stay
On the beach at the
park - that's my
place
To eat with my dime
that I begged from
some rich old slime


I'd like to say it's
alright
Everything's OK
But it's worth it all
just to let you know
I won't take it anyway


I'm sorry for all
the fights, you know
I hate to say you're
right
This battle's beaten
me so
I'd come if you'd
take me back
All I know is I want
to come home
It's so hard to tell
you so


I'd like to say I've
weathered my stay
But it's getting late
and I can't play
Looks like it's time
for goodbye
But I won't cry and
that's no lie
Like to say it's alright
You know it'll be OK
But it was worth it
all to let you know I
won't take it anyway



Where the pontoons bump and spray
All the others reading standing
As the Manly ferry
Cuts it's way to Circular Quay

Hear the Captain blow his whistle
So long she's been away
I miss our early morning wrestle
Not a very happy
Way to start the day

Refrain ~
She don't like that kind of behaviour
She don't like that kind of behaviour

So throw down your guns
Don't you be so reckless
Throw down your guns
Don't you be so

Feel like Scott of the Antarctic
Base camp to far away
A Russian sub beneath the Arctic
Burke and Wills and camels
Initials in the tree



Here at the yellow house
I think that I'm gonna play
With some free livin' lads down the street a ways away
As I feel the moon rise...
The time that I feel is the right time
Here in our 
As I wipe eye bugs away, the candle flickers at me to say
And in my head I sometimes pray
Are you feeling fine?
As I was as a little child
And I'm feeling better when I'm high
With a red light shining on, shining on a little unity
See the mistakes that I've made, no they don't seem to bother me
And I sure as hell don't feel like I've missed any kind of train
If I could only show you how I feel, then you wouldn't bother me
Then maybe then  you'll see
Maybe then you'll see see why we don't mind being blind
As I was a little child
And I'm feeling better when I'm high
With a red light shining on, shining on a little unity
I'll probably be in a little while...



In the car to the whisky
It's 1:30, stinking drunk, 50 cents in my pocket
Turn around-vicky!
On the cuff, on the house, line 'em up, line 'em down one more round
Quarter of two, what to do. Sharks start to circle my my my my my my my
Last call alchohol, time we said bye-bye my my my my my my-vicky!
On the cuff, on the house, line 'em up, line 'em down one more round-one more round
She said "start trottin' boy, my friends are thirsty"
Start trottin' boy, my friends are thirsty
Start trottin' boy, my friends are thirsty
14 Yellow roses, windows for the light
One more round
One more round
One more round
One more round



I was wrong but it takes so much to say it to You
Like a broken husband and wife
Who never talk but share their nights

I'm so close to being so far away from You
I have nothing when I'm living apart from You
Outside, creation groans
To lose our darkness and be made whole

For my feet are close to slipping
Speak to my heart in time
You have promised, so I do believe
You won't forget this wandering child

Still I'm so close to being so far away from You
Though I know no one on their own makes it through
My soul clings to the dust
So in Your life, let it be enough

For my feet are close to slipping
Speak to my heart in time
You have promised, so I do believe
You won't forget this wandering child

I'm so foolish to believe that
I can escape Your love, Your love
I'm so foolish to believe that
I can escape Your love

For my feet were close to slipping
You spoke to my heart in time
And You have promised, so I do believe
You won't forget this wandering child

You're so close when I feel far away from You
You're so close when I feel far away from You



It's all you've been doing since you been 2
You just run, you run away from change,
Leaving me bleeding but you can't see.
You're so dumb, with your big dumb face
And your big dumb ego
What a disgrace, let it go
What a disgrace, let it go

Wait, I aint waiting for shit,
Coz when you're waiting on something, all you can get is a fix
Yeah you were just my fix,
Punchin' your card in for all you can get.
You're so dumb, with your big dumb face
And your big dumb ego
What a disgrace, let it go
What a disgrace, let it go

What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared
You never cared

That I had your back,
Through all the confusion, through all the abuse
And I cared, no matter what you said,
But now you betrayed me, embarrassed and plagued me
So dumb, with your big dumb face
And your big dumb ego
What a disgrace, let it go
What a disgrace, let it go

What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared
What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared,
You never cared.

I always used to say,
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,
I always used to say,
Dig a hole for the next man and you'll fall in,

I always used to say,
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,
I always used to say,
Dig a hole for the next man and you'll fall in,

I know, you know, that you're ready to fall in
I know, you know, that you're ready to fall in
I know, you know, that you're ready to fall in
I know, you know, that you're ready to fall in

Too late now, afraid now
Of all the things I could say now,
It's too late to, complain you
Don't deserve a word... now!

Too late now, afraid now
Of all the things I could say now,
It's too late to, complain you
Don't deserve a word

What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared
What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared.



Assuring you once agian I'm there
'Cause you break my trust, you break my heart
I'll break your fall
Your fall

So I lied, 
Don't say you've done the same without a smile upon your face
'Cause once you've but tasted of this fruit that lay, 
A serpent's swayed your ways
Which brings me to my next thought, 
Walk these roads as crooked as they be
So I lied, and so we lie

Can you feel the tension in the air?
Assuring you once again I'm there
'Cause you break my trust, you break my heart 
I break your fall

And so I lie, 
This time I face the sky without a smile, without a trace.
I don't just see blue I choose to.
With still no sign of you. 
Which brings me to my next thought, 
Don't be fooled by the cunning ways of the truth.


And so I lied, and so we lie.

Weakened knees, 
Belong to those who find it hard to believe, 
But so intrigued.
By the thought of someone, somehow, meeting their needs 
By the thought of someone, somewhere, meeting our needs.

Without tension in the air
Assuring you once again I'm there
You break my trust, you break my heart
I break your fall
Your fall
Your fall
Your fall

But can you feel the tension in the air?
Assuring you once again I'm there
'Cause you break my trust, you break my heart
I'll break your fall
You break my trust your fall so I lied
You break my heart your fall so I lied
Now break your fall
Your fall



Descending in the hope for what tomorrow brings
Depending what you wear and what you choose to sing
But slumped forward on bars, seeing circles instars
You'll find it hard to define who you are
With acclaim, you find it anywhere you are
It's in the dictionary under stars who think they're stars
But then judgement doesn't go far
You've broken the bounds of the circling stars

Show me fame
Decide who to blame
Let me think about it all night
Why do you have to show me again
When you were right the first time

I've watched you turn into a goodbye
Almost into a stranger
The dead have been seen alive
Take my car and drive away, towards the river
Drive to the end of the river

And show me fame
Decide who to blame
Let me think about it all night
Why do you have to show me again
When you were right the first time

Show me blame
Let me think about fame
I'll think about it all night
Why do you have to show me again
I believed you more the first time



'Cause I'm feeling it too
Does it take all direction, all control over you?

When you sing do you slip away?
Back to that place in your mind?
Let our love be the one thing you won't leave behind

Rewind and play
Time to go backwards again
I'm moved by the way
All the notes in-time make the melody
Hold me and sway into the moment we share
Where we can stay so attached to the melody

How I long just to hold you
And see you let go as we dance
I know you're reminiscing through our romance
Can you hear the piano?
And the pulse of the drums?
Does the tune and the groove bring you back to our love?
Oh, come and find it Honey

Rewind and play
Time to go backwards again
I'm moved by the way
All the notes in-time make the melody
Night into day
Can we move onward from here?
Where we can stay on and on attached to the memory

Oh, I know you can feel it
Let it take you there

Rewind and play
Time to go backwards again
I'm moved by the way
All the notes in-time make a sweet melody
Night into day
We have been captured again
A new time and place to make a million new memories



to block out the sun
i don't wanna see what i've become
and you could fight your way

i gotta spit you out

everthing just crashes to the ground

I can be brown again
We have to go hide
'Cause your mother's in town again

And I wanna take you home
And I wanna take you back

I'm on the ground
You're in the air again
Releasing the hounds
You wanted a harlequin

And I wanna take you home
And I wanna take you back

And I wanna take you home
And I wanna take you back Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar

I'm cutting the wire Sugar sugar
There's nobody listening Sugar sugar
Slashing the tires Sugar sugar
Made you late for the christening Sugar sugar

And I wanna take you home
And I wanna throw you back
And I wanna take you home
And the screen just turns to black

It's hot, it's warm, it's cool, all right
I kiss, you take another bite
You said, "Just stay away from light"
Down here I'm not afraid of height

And I wanna take you home
'Cause I wanna take it back
And I wanna take you home
And the screen just turns to black Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar
Sugar sugar



And all rich ones too.
Rich kids of the world unite.
Rich kids of the...

Dime on the bleachers,
Head says not that far away
But the only way up is down,
And I keep on falling.
Flip it again, 
But the answer hasn't spared a change.

Doesn't matter how much time,
You'll never forget that forgetting's required.

Served on a platter of fakes,
It's inevitable:
We're proud to be pricks.

You left
Behind?

Answer. 
Someone, 
Anyone.
Won't you pick up the pieces
You left,
Behind?

Kiss and kill your boyfriend.



For our King and our country and the promise of glory
We came from Kingston and Brighton to fight on the front line

Just lads from the farms and boys from the cities
Not meant to be soldiers we lay in the trenches

We'd face the fighting with a smile - or so we said
If only we had known what danger lay ahead

The sky turned to grey as we went into battle
On the fields of Europe young men were fallin'

I'll be back for you someday - it won't be long
If I can just hold on 'til this bloody war is over

The guns will be silent
On Remembrance Day
There'll be no more fighting
On Remembrance Day

By September of '18 Cambrai had fallen
Soon the war would be over and we'd be returnin'

Don't forget me while I'm gone far away
Well it won't be long 'til I'm back there in your arms again

One day soon - I don't know when
You know we'll all be free and the bells of peace will ring again

The time will come for you and me
We'll be goin' home when this bloody war is ended

The guns will be silent
On Remembrance Day
We'll all say a prayer
On Remembrance Day

On Remembrance Day - say a little prayer
On Remembrance Day

Well the guns will be silent 
There'll be no more fighting
Oh we'll lay down our weapons 
On Remembrance Day



These days are speeding by
This ring gives me a new point of view
I'm a dealer of my time

And if I can make a confession
My time is torn between
The man who has won my affections
And the God who made me

And oh, it all looks different
But that doesn't mean anything has changed

'Cause still I, I reach for You
When I, I am afraid
And this breath that comes from You
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name, yeah, yeah

I look at the life of Anna
Your presence was her home
I look at the life of my mother
Praying on her back porch

Oh, it all looks different
But that doesn't mean anything has changed

'Cause still I, I reach for You
When I, I am afraid
And this breath that comes from You
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name, yeah

One day very soon, face to face
I'll give an account of my time to You, to You

So I will reach for You
When I am afraid
'Cause this breath that comes from You
Helps me say, yeah
Helps me say, yeah

'Cause still I, I reach for You
When I, I am afraid
And this breath that comes from You
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name, yeah, yeah

I'm trying to find a moment with You
These days are speeding by



Don't lose your mystique
Wait a little longer
Tomorrow brings another feast
Don't let go
Don't lose your reputation
Thank God you're still alive
You're still in one piece

Hang on in there
Don't lose your appetite
Hang on in there
Forget the danger signs
Pray for that magical moment straight ahead and it will appear
Don't fight for lost emotions
Wait for the sunrise
And everything will seem so clear
Look straight ahead, look straight ahead
Hang on in there hang on in there
Hang on in there hang on in there
Your wish will be granted
All your problems will disappear

Don't be a fool
You haven't reached your peak
You got a fast car racing up inside you
Your life is incomplete

Hang on in there
Hang on in there
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear
Wait for that moment
Wait for the sunrise
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear

Hey, let's go, let's go!

Okay, now do the change now.

Yeah, hang on in there
Hang on in there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah!



Flowers from a world that had taken her heart
They looked so pretty, but the blood stained them

If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away
If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away

Pull the braids untie all the pain from your hair
Don't let the buzzards try, or they'll take what's been there
Signs appear, and the worst you fear

If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away
If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away

Don't look to the dark all the pain that you want is here
Uncover your heart so the feeling can disappear
The worst winds are calling, they need you they want you
I'm in the dark and I can't see a thing for miles

If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away
If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away

I know, I've seen the pain in your heart
Because I died for us



and walked out of the north station,
in these busy streets
people buy fake brands and chinese stereos
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

i am the watcher now, i arrived here way too early
someone hits me in a rush carrying a giant tv dish
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

that's how they keep in touch with a distant past that i don't understand
it's 8 o' clock it seems like nighttime awaits the proper time to fall
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

wooo
my body's slow
you're far out
you got to keep it cool
don't let it get to you

cheap sunglasses, prostitutes, this ain't nothing new
i'm meeting a friend of mine
he lives up there in a room, 3 meters square
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

i say i'm gonna gut the house
and i will make one better
he says you do it man that's a good plan
just make it happen
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

we ain't taking no subway we wanna stay in the last sunlight
as it fades away so suddenly
we bump into the night
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

wooo
my body's slow
you're far out
you got to keep it cool
don't let it get to you

streetlights still dim i look around
and get the feeling that this place
is somewhere no one really wants to be at all, but that's allright
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

the small time crooks and begger-women are being led off to their homes
the blinking lights invite me
telling i don't need no sleep tonight
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

i love the way alcohol tastes, today's hangover
i wash it away
this city's just big enough
to lose yourself entirely
in one day
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

wooo
my body's slow
you're far out
you got to keep it cool
don't let it get to you

bebop music a ceiling of smoke we're talking lazily about our hopes
closing time always comes on time
the fruits of spoiling kids, it's us
we go on and on and ...
unconscious

we go on and on and on,
oh what is the outcome
take a deap breath make a new wish you'll get through one day
we go on and on and ...
unconscious
we haven't got a clue
keep your mouth shut
get in line
this ain't nothing new
this ain't nothing new



In the dark, who can reach him? 
He hides like a child. 
He hides like a child. 
Keeps his finger on the trigger 
You know he can't stand the day 
Shoot out the lights. 
Shoot out the lights. 

Keep the blind down on the window 
Ah, keep the pain on the inside 
Just watching the dark. 
Just watching the dark. 
Ah he might laugh but you won't see him 
As he thunders through the night 

Shoot out the lights. 
Shoot out the lights. 

In the darkness the shadows move 
In the darkness the game is real 
Real as a gun. 
Real as a gun. 
As he watches the lights of the city 
And he moves through the night 
Shoot out the lights. 
Shoot out the lights. 
Shoot out the lights. 
Ah, shoot out the lights.







O Deanna!
O Deanna
Sweet Deanna!
O Deanna
You know you are my friend, yeah
O Deanna
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul 

No carpet on the floor
And the winding cloth holds many moths
Around your Ku Klux furniture
I cum of death-head in your frock
We discuss the murder plan
We discuss murder and the murder act
Murder takes the wheel of your Cadillac
And death climbs in the back 

O Deanna
This is a car
O Deanna
This is a gun
O Deanna
And this a day number one
O Deanna
Our little crimeworn histories
Black and smoking christmas trees
And honey, it ain't mystery
Why you're a mystery to me 

We will eat out of their pantries
And their parlours
Ashy leaving in their beds
And we'll unload into their heads
On this mean season
This little angel that I squeezin'
She ain't been mean to me 

O Deanna
O Deanna!
O Deanna
You are my friend and my partner
O Deanna
On this house on the hill
O Deanna
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul 

O Deanna
I am a-knocking
O Deanna
With my toolbox and my stocking
O Deanna
And I'll meet you on the corner
O Deanna
Yes, you point it like a finger
O Deanna
And squeeze its little thing
O Deanna
Feel its kick, hear its bang
And let no worry about its issue
Don't worry about where its been
And don't worry about where it hits
Cause it just ain't yours to sin 

O Deanna
No it just ain't your to sin
O Deanna
Sweet Deanna
O Deanna
And we ain't getting any younger
O Deanna
And I don't intend gettin' any older
O Deanna
The sun a hump at my shoulder
O Deanna
O Deanna!
O Deanna
Sweet Deanna
O Deanna
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love of money
I'm down here for your soul



She left my dreams just out of reach,
She left her footprints in the sand,
She was a bird right in the hand,

I met a girl that made me laugh,
She left a faded photograph,
I thought I heard a silent song,
I sang along but I was...

I was only dreamin',
I was only dreamin',
Visions in my head,
Talking in my sleep,
Turning in my bed,
But I was only dreamin'.

I met a girl that talked in rhyme,
I met a girl who took her time,
I saw the ocean in her eyes,
I saw myself unrecognized,
And all the stars up in the sky,
Fell down like rain and made me cry,
I held the world right in my hands,
I held her close but I was...

I was only dreamin',
I was only dreamin',
I was only dreamin',
Visions in my head,
Talking in my sleep,
Turning in my bed,
Life was so complete,
But I was only dreamin'...

Wake up, wake up
I was only dreamin',
Oh Yeah - I was only dreamin',
I was only dreamin',
Visions in my head,
Talking in my sleep,
Turning in my bed,
Life was so complete,
Her shoes were on the beach,
But I was only dreamin'.



Who left me passed out on the floor
I know it might be wrong
I had to write this song
For a hundred girls and hundreds more

There was Katherine in Manhattan
Her mouth was always laughin'
She's always a distraction
Cuz she always wants some action
At one she took me in a cab
Two, in a Soho bar
Three, she got real bad
And jumped me in a subway car

These are Mary's voodoo ways
We would stay in bed for days
In an alligator haze
In her swampy Southern place
She broke me down on Bourbon Street
Curled up at her feet
As Mary flashed the parades
I fixed myself with hurricanes

100 girls or maybe more 
Who left me passed out on the floor
I wish I heard you tell me
Make up your mind
Wake up
Make up your mind
Make up your mind

This is Daisy, this is crazy
Always telling me I'm lazy
Her endurance would amaze me
And her swearing didn't phase me
It was based upon a sweet lie
Like a butterfly
She showed herself in many phases
And had a thing for public places
Late at night in Fenway Park
She led me naked through the dark
Daisy let me suffer there
Smothered in my underwear

100 girls or maybe more
Who left me passed out on the floor
I wish I heard you tell me
Make up your mind
Wake up
Make up your mind
Make up your mind

There was Allison and here's the thing
I thought that she was 17
She was 18 but looked 16
And told me she was 23

Valerie who hated money
Stuck me to the sheets with honey
Caroline from Amsterdam
Took off with some other band
Megan, Kim and the rest
I love you all and that's the test
If I wake up in time
How will I make up my mind

100 girls or maybe more
Who left me passed out on the floor
I know it might be wrong
I had to write this song
For 100 girls and hundreds more
Who left me passed out on the floor
I know it might be wrong
I had to write this song
For 100 girls, and hundreds more



It weighs heavier on me all the time
What a silent yet such a deadly crime
To think that I own my own life

So humble me just like You did
The king who lost his mind in the wilderness
And don't let me go back until I confess
You are the only God
You are the only God

Deliver me from my hateful thoughts
I'm committing murder in the presence of God
Break my heart just like David's was
With a weeping, pregnant widow in my house

How can I despise my brother
When I killed Your only begotten Son?
Help me prefer another and say
You are the only God
You are the only God

You
You

This morning my alarm went off
Earlier than I'd ever want
But in this small obedience, Lord
Help my heart stay bowed down

Father, You've given Jesus
All those He will raise up
And all eyes including mine will see
You are the only God
You are the only God
You are the only

Deliver me
Deliver me
Deliver me
...



Among the hollow of faces I know you're there, it must be soon
And I must straighten up, review my disposition
Pour the hope back in my eyes I thought I'd lost so long ago

Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom, oh

Always a love and beauty, a lover's sighs content too soon
Somewhere behind her heartbeat, a breath of kindness hints of gloom
So I must straighten up, review my disposition
Pour the hope back in my eyes I thought I'd lost so long ago

Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom, oh

When you get there, well you know
Oh, yeah, I wanna be there
Oh yeah, ah-you get there, well, you know
Oh yeah, I wanna be there, yeah
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
Take it on, take it on

Oh yeah, when you get there, well, you know
Oh-oh, I wanna be there
Oh, when you get there, well, you know
Oh, I wanna be there
I wanna be there, I wanna be there, oh

Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom, oh

Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away, roll away
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
And roll away, roll away, roll away

Hopes drift in, higher places
It's easier-ah, above the ground you know
Hopes are drifting, hearts been lifting
Somebody somewhere no, done you wrong
I don't know, ah no no no no no

Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby



And imagine how we could survive inside these lies
The role she plays to try 
And hide the corrupted life she helped create
Marks are left
There's no surprise with the pills she hides
She can't deny the pillow talk that she has made me listen to her plea
Deep inside she'll realize she can't 
She cant hold on
In your mind you're the cause of there demise
She screams out loud
He holds on tight
Turn around and run away
Your life is on the line again
Save your self one last time 
Don't make a sound
He just arrived back to his home
He steps inside
Bottle in hand he feels invincible 
It's a matter of time to cross the line
Feel the chaos rage inside
He's out of blood and won't return till he is satisfied 
With the ending to her life
Deep inside he'll realize he can't 
He can't hold on
In your mind you're the cause of their demise 
She screams out loud
He holds on tight
Turn around and run away
Your life is on the line again
Save your self one last time



So you think you know how to button your clothes
You udon't know shit
If you hadn't already guessed
You're just a bump on the log of life
'Cos Mother knows best
She tells everybody she ws born in a ditch
She backcombs her hair till she looks like a witch
Wolves in her train, serpents suckle at her breast
Don't forget to wsh behind your ears
'Cos Mother knows best
O you lost your job, well ain't that a shame
Got nobody but youself to blame
You deserve everything you get for such carelessness
And don't eat your peas off the knife
O Mother knows best
So your baby's hungry
So your baby's sick
Don't make babies, that'll do the trick
Put another string of barbed wire in your little love nest
It's better than a cardboard box
Mother knows best
She got a zombie army to serve her well
She got a thousand bloodhounds from the gates of Hell
she got a hundred black horses with sulphur and coal on their breath
And she rides the unbelievers down
Mother knows best
She says, bring me your first-born
I'll suck their blood
Bring me your poor
I can trample in the mud
Bring me your visionaries
I can puthout their eyes
Bring me your scholars
I'll have them all lobotomised
Mother knows best

A procession of prosthetic limbs and mannequins.
They're all perfect models of imperfection,
With marrow made of cellophane.

Strap on your ballroom best.
Breathe in and don't exhale.
Oh, Juliet! Oh, Juliet! Deny your name, your father.

Rearrange the cells that form my skin.
See them through kaleidoscope eyes.
Because everybody feigns sometimes.

Blur your eyes,
Romeo.
Bend the lines,
Romeo.
Do you like what you see?
Oh, Romeo

Where art thou?
I've dressed up this canvas skin; Painted something colorful just for you.
Self-inflicted surgery is now routine.
It erases all traces of faces we have all known; We have all owned.

Stretch me over this two-by-four skeleton.



At the road that led to you
All the times I write tryin' to save myself
From looking at the truth

I walk alone, while you are waiting
But somehow you saw through me
And now I'm standing at your door
You're the only one I need

It takes two, two hearts that beat together
To make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender
When love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two

I've been blinded by this fear inside
That love is just a game
You distract yourself with someone else
And both having travelled in pain

Bow now I see the road I've taken
Will lead me to nothing more
Than empty rooms without your love
Girl, I'm standing at your door

It takes two, two hearts that beat together
To make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender
When love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two, oh

I walk alone while you are waiting
I knew where I'm wanted to be
So now I'm standing at your door
You're the only one I need

It takes two, two hearts that beat together
To make it feel like one
Oh one life with you, one life with you

Oh, takes two, two hearts that beat together
To make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender
When love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two, oh



All you got to do is play the jukebox player
Come on little girl
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Well, if you don't mind, anytime
Shakin' up the crowd to the rhythm and rock
I said, come on come on
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Listen to what I mean
Won't you listen to me
'Cause it feels so good
Oh get back on your feet
Break out on the floor
Now I'll come over to ya
And I'll dance some more

Got to get away, everyday
Darlin' don't you listen to a thing we say
I said come on little girl
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Now you don't feel shy
When you shake it around
'Cause it feels so right
Oh, I'm in this blues
She having a sure great time
Rock and roll
'Cause I'm about to go

Oh we gotta go
Does she know
Everybody waitin' for the place to blow
Come on little girl
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Got to get away, everyday
Everybody drinkin' while the jukebox's playin'
I said come on come on
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

I'll teach you how to rock and roll
Hey baby girl
I'll teach you how to rock and roll



The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride
And I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for stormy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know
That I still love you so
Only heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never take away my misery
Since we're not together
I'll pray for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Some day when my crying's done
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Since we're not together
I'll pray for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Some day when my crying's done
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain



Been lied to and cheated
Misused and abused
Like something that you throw away

First you fill me with thunder
Then you let me go under
You can run, you can hide
But you ain't gonna get away

'Cause you're under suspicion
Of leaving the scene of a broken heart
Under suspicion 
Of a hit and run love affair

You ain't got a conscience
And you made me the victim
Of a cruel and unusual crime
Now you're under suspicion
Under suspicion
Under suspicion
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair

No matter where you be going
I got ways of knowing
And somewhere down the line
You're gonna have to pay

'Cause you're under suspicion
Of leaving the scene of a broken heart
Under suspicion 
Of a hit and run love affair

You ain't got a conscience
And you made me the victim
Of a cruel and unusual crime
Now you're under suspicion
Under suspicion
Under suspicion
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair

Under suspicion
Under suspicion
Ain't got no where to run 'cause you're under suspicion
Under suspicion 
Under suspicion
Under suspicion 
Of leavin' the scene of a broken heart
Under suspicion
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair



No hesitation why you ask
You have another waiting at home 
And yes she matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you

You didn't mean to meet her you cry
Oh but the sun goes down every night 
She came to you when you were alone
And yes she matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you

I promised myself.....a long time ago
It would be difficult to let you go
If not atleast within
The touch of my fingers-
It was close to being 
In heaven-
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
To being in heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Is to be......in heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
I know I know



And you caught my eye,
But I never thought that I'd be touchin' you,

How was I to know,
I'd let my feelin's go,
And that I'd be yours before the night was through.

One night love affair,
Tryin' to make like we don't care,
We were both reachin' out for somethin',

One night love affair,
Pretendin' it ain't there,
Oh - and now we're left with nothin'.

When the mornin' breaks,
We go our separate ways,
If the night was made for love it ain't for keeps,

But I lose control,
As I watch you go,
All my senses say I'm in this much too deep,
Now you're outta reach.

One night love affair,
Tryin' to make like we don't care,
We were both reachin' out for somethin',

One night love affair,
Pretendin' it ain't there,
Oh - and now we're left with nothin'.

Guitar Solo

One night love affair,
Tryin' to make like we don't care,
We were both reachin' out for somethin',

One night love affair,
Sometimes life ain't fair,
Oh - and now we're left with nothin', nothin' - Yeah.



There speaks a true friend 
There speaks a friend for life 

You told me all the things 
That you think are wrong with me 
I just wish you'd stayed around and helped me put them right 
But nevertheless : 


There ... mm 
There speaks a true friend 
There speaks a friend for life 


You listed all the things 
That people cannot stand about me 
I just wish you'd stayed around and helped me to improve 
Because I've tried, I've tried 
Oh, I've really really tried 


You say I don't know how to live 
And that's true 
You say I don't deserve to live 
Oh, where would I be without my friends to help me ? 
I just can't imagine where I'd be, can you ? 
No



Always say the things I wanna hear,
I believe them all - The stories short and tall,
I believe you - Yeah I believe you.

You give me love,
When love is all I need to live,
You gave your word, when words were just superlative,
When I was blind, you came and opened up my eyes,
Now I feel I can believe in anything,
You taught me how to fly on broken wings.

Always do the things I can depend on,
Always there, every night and day,
Everytime I've fallen down - You've always been around,
To lift me up again,
To set me straight again.

Yeah you give me love,
When love is all I need to live,
You gave your word, when words were just superlative,
When I was blind, you came and opened up my eyes,
Now I feel I can believe in anything,
You taught me how to fly on broken wings.

Sometimes I find myself on my own,
And can't find the road that leads me back home,
But you made me believe I can do anything,
Even fly on broken wings.

Ohh you give me love, love, love,
When love is all I need to live,
You gave your word, when words were just superlative,
When I was blind, you came and opened up my eyes,
Now I feel I can believe in anything,
You taught me how to fly on broken wings.

Taught me how to fly - Yeah,
On broken wings.



Then it woke you up last night
You sounded so damn worried
You've been tossing, turning, both ends burning

I wanna put your mind at ease again
Make everything alright
I know it's getting underneath your skin
I've tried to tell you now

Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seeing in your dreams
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason
Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me

With your imagination and emotions running wild
Fueling my frustrations like a fire burning, clock keeps turning
I know it's getting underneath your skin
I've tried to tell you know

Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seeing in your dreams
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason
Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me
You're looking at the ghost of me
You're looking at the ghost of me

Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seeing 
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason
Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me
You're looking at the ghost of me
You're looking at the ghost of me



Sometimes you're lucky
Sometimes you're better off dead

Your first breath is taken and into the world you are cast
You long for tomorrow while living each day as your last

Well I know what your heart desires
But you can't take it with you
Into the fire

Now you've done all you can
Your life's at the crossroads
You watch as it slips through your hands

So you stand on the mountain and shout in vain at the sky
But nobody hears you - the words only echo inside

Oh shelter the flame - it may expire
Risin' up from the ashes
Into the fire

Just hold onto your life down to the wire
Oh out from the dragon's jaws
Into the fire

There's a moment in every man's life
When he must decide what is wrong and what's right

You could wait for your dreams to come true
But time has no mercy
Time won't stand still for you

Well I know what your heart desires
Crawlin' out from the wreckage
Into the fire

Here I go...Into the fire
I know...what your heart desires



I'm not the buzz in the information
I'm not no sick sexual saviour
I´m your fxxking bad behaviour
it´s never that easy when you piss in my way
yet i feel so easy when you piss in my face
i feel so easy so wild and crazy
You're so wild and crazy



it's funny how you put yourself in cruise control
you say you say your life is very plain
waiting for a spark to light the coal inside
and that is when you feel alive
but that's just where it starts
are you too comfortable in the dark?

 
you threw it all away
you had so much to gain
you threw it all away
now there's nothing left to claim
and now you're lost inside of you
what am i supposed to do

generation lost
all for everything until it comes to the cross
a fear of faith becomes their cage 
they're getting used to
feeling weightless
breathing fakeness
dreaming faithless 



To talk to you
feeling weightless
breathing fakeness
dreaming faithless

 

what am i supposed to do?



It's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
Unending nights of temptation
It's a jungle out there
But you just don't care
Each night you dress up to kill them

Down at the watering hole
You stalk your prey with high fashion
With self control, you blade-roll
The lonely and the lonely heart hunters
The neon love life, oh it cuts like a knife
I hear you call it civilization
It's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there

The sounds and shadows surround you
You're swinging vine to vine
Below the nightmare it gathers
It's like a jungle, at feeding time
Clawing through the crowd each night
Oh you set your trap so carefully, a trophy for your wall
Someone has you in their sights
You are both the hunters and the prey, no winners at all
I hear you call it civilization
It's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
Unending nights of temptation
It's a jungle out there
But you just don't care

Unending nights of temptation
It's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
Civilization! Oh!
It's a jungle out there
You call it civilization
It's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there



Today, makin' love tomorrow
So away, swooping you're so fragile
Die today, you disgrace the mortal

Fight me lately, tied to someone
We've been laughing since you've been gone
And I want to know did you all enjoy the show?
It's so sad to see you go

And you know

Hanging low today, I replace the highway
Love the only way, linking hands the wrong way
So I barely see you go
It's so sad to see you go
I just thought I'd let you know

And you know
You know
Alone
Woah, so so



Will be the very last time that I ask you along
I'm just to uptight to be waiting around
I've taken more than enough to make up my mind
Unemotional - I know
A futureless peep show
All shimmering but it's empty and slow
Since I lost my feeling some time ago
20th century cold
My head's plugged in where the sun don't shine
Where there's no room for anybody else
Waging chemical warfare against myself
Just to get through the day
You see I gotta hurry it away
Unacceptable - I know
I'm an idiot sideshow
I'm .. blah-blah-blah
And I lost my caring some time ago
20th century cold
My heart still beats but I'm cold
Don't you feel it
Don't you feel it
As you breathe it
Don't you believe it
Don't you see it
Can't you feel it
Can't you feel it's cold -
It's cold.
Approaching Catatonia
It's a quarter to three
I see myself reflected
In the television screen
Somewhere very far away
I can hear myself scream
And I get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
Get that same old feeling
20th century cold.



Whisper words of desire
Rescue me - darling rescue me

make your home in the wild
and she's got eyes
and they're animal eyes
they mett holes in the ice
eyes burning brights as planet...

you placed the pillow under my head
when I was sick and full of greed

I love her kind
and her kind is in me
she is my night light
she hurts my eyes
she steals my steep
she lives up above the top of the heap
she sixes up above the stock and frict
and she hurts me in my pride
takes away the hatchet knife
that I've kept with me throughout my life
she's untouchable
she's 6's up
and 6's down
yeah 6 stairs up
and 6 steps down

and my heart is full
I like this life
is that OK to you !



Well it's Brooklyn Bums
Well it's the dirty birds
Well it's the Lordz of Brooklyn won't go back on our words
Cause' we're pissing on the curbs, dishing out the dirt
Yo! someone's got to shout out to Bensonhurst
Ray Ridge Lordz rule
I might lose my cool
in a bar room brawl
and beat them down with a stool
I'm drunk it hit my head
I'm pissed I'm turning red
Well it's the Lordz of Brooklyn
if you fuck around you're dead
E to the D to the G the E
Like the loans shark's muscle
Admoney "Yo, I'll bust your freakin' knee!"
With a bat or a pipe
In my parish that's a fight
Yo, you caught the Brooklyn fever on a Saturday night.

Come on!
It's a Saturday night
Come On!
It's a Saturday Night
Come on!
It's a Saturday night
So bring your boys and your bats cause it's a bar fight

Admoney
Ayeoo! Kick off your shoes, jump off the rock
It's the crazy white boy from a Brooklyn block
Standing on the corner drinking cheap wine
It's a Saturday night, yo, let's all get high
Puffing on the blunts and sipping on the brews
Mess with LOB!
Punk! Yo! You lose
I'm out getting drunk, writing on the walls
Step to ADM If you got the balls
I come full fisted swinging the bat
So tell me right now man
Who's the mack?
I'm in my Cadillac, running red lights
The cops on my tail
It's a Saturday night..

Come On!
It's a Saturday night X 3
So bring your hoes and blades cause it's a bar fight..

Kaves
I got the Saturday Night fever, word to mama mia
It's that crazy L.O.Bia, yo It's my pizzeria
Connected like Sinatra
The phantom of the opera
The turnstile hopper
Admoney "Fuck those coppers"
Got the Dean Martin style
Dino Botz: "Woo doo bee doo"
I got the drunken flow
"From the Budweiser brew"Dino Botz
Swinging on the cable Like I'm Tony Manaro
The ginny gang plank is the Verrazzano
Like Lucky Luciano with the tommy gun
I never leave the body till the job is done
Won't be late for dinner, cause I'm mommy's son
And like my Pop said never turn and run

Scotty Edge
Just leave them laid out, lights out
kissing on the pavement
Well it's the Edge One, ADM, and the Kaves
and Paulie Two Time, and my man Dino Botz
And we're the Lordz of Brooklyn and we ain't got gotz..




I could feel your heart break into a hundred pieces
We were too torn apart, now it seems so senseless
And if we're clever, we'll put it together, it may be forever

We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again

Down on my luck, you arrived just in time, my angel
Thought you'd given me up, like a rhyme that needs no reason
I want you enough to keep my life untangled
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cos it may be forever

We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again 

I want you enough to keep my life untangled
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cos it may be forever

We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again

We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again

If ever we'll make it, we're gonna make it girl
And I know we can take it, we got to take it, girl

If ever we can make it, we gotta make it
And I know we can take it...



I'm sick and I'm tired and I'm fried and you gotta believe me
Yeah, Sapphire
If I cross myself when I come would you maybe receive me?

Yeah, Sapphire
You were feisty at first but I broke you and I showed you the tempo
Sacramento
It swung at us first but it ended up going down gentle

Sapphire, if Cheyenne's too small
We'll haul it all back to St. Paul
I was just about to call you
When you called

Yeah, Sapphire
I know the last time we touched I came on a bit rough, please forgive me
Yeah, Sapphire
After you left, it was a big sketchy mess, they almost killed me

Sapphire, if Cheyenne's too small
We'll haul it all back to St. Paul
I was just about to call you
When you called

Sapphire, if St. Paul don't call
We've always got Aberdeen
'Cause dreams they seem to cost money
But money costs some dreams

It went just as you predicted
I swear there must be something in your dreams
It all went down exactly like your visions
And I know you said don't call until I'm clean

I'm not drunk, I'm cut, I'm gushing blood
And I need someone to come and pick me up

I was a skeptic at first, but these miracles work
I was a skeptic at first, but these miracles work
I was a skeptic at first, but these miracles work
I was a skeptic at first, but these miracles work



There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love ev'rywhere
Give a little love to me I want it
Take a little love from me
I want to share it with you

Feel like a millionaire
Once we were mad we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember my love
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid
We could stay there, forever and ever

Now I am sad
You are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me
How I long for your love
Come back to me
Be happy like we used to be

Come back, come back to me
Come back, come back to me

Oh come back to me, oh my love
How I long for your love
Won't you come back to me?

My fine friend
Take me wiz you unt love me forever
My fine friend
Forever forever

Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love ev'rywhere
Give a little love to me I want it
Take a little love from me
I want to share it with you
Come back, come back to me, make me feel
Make me feel like a millionaire



All I've become
Has Fall'n apart
Hole in my heart

Severed fragments of my being
Piece together, give life meaning
Fragile quilts of faded memories
Torn apart by life's disease again

I will cry
All is a lie
That you pray
Heal my heartache

Severed Fragments of my being
piece together, give life meaning
fragile quilts of faded memories
torn apart by life's disease again

I will cry



Rush off along awaited friends
We're not impressed with blinded herds
Nor with the way they dress
We're not impressed with blinded herds
Nor with the way they dress

We saw those animals ahead toughening their skin
Scraped and bruised couldn't be good
Woke to cleaner and fresher air
Resistance can't help the frightend ones
Run only when you are threatend
Much of which comes from childhood
And from being blunt

Rush off along awaited offenders
Rush off along awaited friends

We're not impressed with blinded herds
Nor with the way they dress

Casual instinces of "random bursts"
Make for times enemy
What is to lose?
Only yourself and everything
Do you think I'm letting up?
Stray us from nationalism
Our anthems respected
We feel strong
Use it's platform
Mark yourselves from cornerstones

Ruch off along awaited offenders
Rush off along awaited friends

We're not impressed with blinded herds
Nor with the way they dress

Rush off along awaited offenders
Rush off along awaited friends

We're not impressed with blinded herds
Nor with the way they dress

You be Starsky and I'll be Hutch
They'll never find out where we'll go
We can forward our calls illegally to Mexico

You can be the sleeping cure
And I'll memorize subversive literature
From our secret mountain base
We can broadcast all over the place

Radio bomb!
The sound of freedom
Radio bomb!
The sound of freedom

We can launch a satellite
So you can hear the day in the middle of the night
And the RLI and the FCC
Will be driving around in their little undercover R.V.s

They'll call us terrorists
And try to stop us in the name of government interests
From our secret underwater base
We are coming to you all over the place

Radio bomb
The sound of freedom
Radio bomb
The sound of freedom

Radio bomb!
The sound of freedom!

What am I listening to?



The blood will make you rich

And come tonight, yeah come tonight 
We'll take a ride

You will lead me, down to the hollow

You will lead me down



My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure

Huh, but does she really want to?
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door

Don't try to fight the feelin'
'Cause the thought alone
Is killing me right now

Huh, thank God for mom and dad
For sticking through together
'Cause we don't know how, huh

Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
Til there's nothing at all

We get together
Oh, we get together
But separates always better
When there's feelings involved

If what they say is nothing is forever
Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes love the exception

So why oh, why oh, why oh
Why oh, why oh, are we so in denial?
When you know we're not happy here

Or y'all don't want me here
You just wanna dance
Don't want to meet your daddy
Just want you in my caddy

Don't want to meet your momma
Just want to make you cumma

She'd breach the walls of Jericho,
Make you fall like virgin snow,
She's got a smile - Makes you forget the things,
You were only just thinking about,
It kind of turns me inside out,
And if I try to conceal, she's got a way to reveal.

I feel so naked - I feel so totally exposed,
It's such a mystery, how she seems to know, every part of me,
I feel so shaken - It's like everybody knows,
Whenever she touches me, no one else can feel, as much as me,
Yeah she's got a way.

She's got a way - Of taming the wild in me,
With patience and serenity,
I'm drowning in her revery,
And I can't run away - She's got a way to make me stay.

I feel so naked - I feel so totally exposed,
It's such a mystery, how she seems to know, every part of me,
I feel so shaken - It's like everybody knows,
Whenever she touches me, no one else can feel, as much as me,
Oh, 'cause she's got a way.

She comes to me like rain falls down my window,
Sure as night will follow day - I'll surrender,
She's got a way.

I feel so naked - I feel so totally exposed,
It's such a mystery, how she seems to know, every part of me,
I feel so shaken - It's like everybody knows,
Whenever she touches me, no one else can feel, as much as me,
Oh, 'cause she's got a way - She's got a way.

Such a mystery - She seems to know, every part of me,
Oh she's got a way,
She's got a way,
She's got a way.



I'm infected with your love I need some Bacitracin
Please don't kick me out on the streets out the door
I don't want to stay on my cousin's couch no more
I can't do it I can't go back to livin' that way
Sweet sweet sugar momma
I know that I can change
I won't do the shit that piss you off and make you mad
Like running late to dinner with your business friends
Or being out late night with the fellas at the club
Or the time I forgot your birthday cuZ I's at the studio
And I will try to be a little more sensitive
Because I love you baby boo boo
And I need a place to live
I Can't go back to Jersey

Yo, I got a message from my girl who was furious and cryin
She said who was that chick you were speakin with last night
Now stop lying
Oh no! What can I do I'm against the wall
While I was flirting with this honey
I made a pocket call
For 15 minutes she heard me layin it on thick
Now she's got the kitchen knife and she's staring at the dilsnick
Nothing happened
I didn't touch her, didn't even smile, didn't even fuck her
didn't grind for a little while
Didn't even laugh, buy a drink or hold her hand
She slapped me in the face
And said pack your shit man!

I Can't go back to Jersey

Like dat, and you don't stop...
You know I'm squirmin' tryin' to get back in good graces
I keep layin'it on thick tripping on my shoelaces
I really love you, I rub a dub you
I fill the tub with bubbles on the double
Oh shit I'm in trouble
Buy you flowers cook you dinner
I hope my friends
Don't see you running me 'round like Bruce Jenner
That would not be cool it might ruin my rep
And my main objective is to keep the bed where we slept
last night and the night before last
Gotta solve this problem fast
Move past this situation
I really should've had my phone on lock
Cause she just threw all of my shit
out the window on the block

I Can't go back to Jersey
I ain't goin' back
I Can't go back to Jersey
I ain't goin' back
I Can't go back to Jersey

Every colour of spring by the summer sky
And the way that you swing, like a metronome
Every body wants the number of your telephone
And you know it

Sweeter than 'I told you so'
Cooler than the place to go
Every station plays your record on the radio

How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you

If their making a list, their gonna put you on
If your going to sit they'll make the table long
When you get up to dance their gonna clear the floor
They want to know if you'll move them like you did before
And you know it

Sweeter than 'I told you so'
Cooler than the place to go
Every body plays your music on the stereo

How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you

What am I gonna do
With a guy like you
Wow... guy like you

How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep a guy like you
How'm I gonna keep my eye on a guy like you

What am I gonna do...

I see the crowd you're hanging with and those kids don't seem positive
Don't all the cigs make you tired?
You know I'd never ask you to change, I'll only ask you to try

I know you're gonna do what I know you're gonna do
But 22 and banging around in restaurants
Isn't that much prettier than banging around in bars
And why do you keep going to his car?

I don't want this to stop, I want you to know
I don't want you to settle, I want you to grow
Forget all the boys that you had at the harbor
They're too hard already, they'll only get harder

Jessie, let's go for a ride
I know a place that we can stop
I know a place that we could drink and kiss for awhile
I know a place that always makes you smile

I know you're gonna say what I know you're gonna say
I know you'll look at the ground, I know you'll probably cry
You're a beautiful girl and you're a pretty good waitress
But Jessie, I don't think I'm the guy

I don't want this to stop, I want you to know
I don't want you to settle, I want you to grow
Forget everything that I showed you this summer
You're too hard already, you'll only get harder

But they didn't name her for a saint
They named her for a storm
So how's she supposed to think about
How it's gonna feel in the morning?

She said if heaven's hypothetical
And if the cigs keep you warm
Then how's she supposed to think about
How it's gonna move in the morning?

About how it's gonna move in the morning
About how it's gonna move in the morning

Hurricane Jessie's gonna crash into the harbor this summer
She don't want to wait till she gets older
Hurricane Jessie's gonna crash into the harbor this summer
She don't want to wait, she said it only gets harder



To all wavebands on earth
Reconnoitre on the killahertz

This tune is going out to Marconi
To all corners of the globe
There ain't no hut in the Serengeti
Where my wavelengths do not probe

If a rocket went to Saturn
We sure hope a D.J. is on board
For some anti-gravity mixing
With two dub plates of U-Roy

Throwdown Stray Cat strut in Bulawayo - hey, Bulawayo
Buddy Rich in Burundi
Quadrophenia in Armenia
Armenia City In The Sky
Big Youth booming in Jakarta
Nina Simone over Sierra Leone
Wild sound of Joujouka in Nevada - hey, Joujouka
Everywhere, everywhere Bob's bringing it all back home

Yeah, I let the boogie-woogie rumble
In the back of Bangalore
I get complaints from Bondi Beach
What, no longboard surf hardcore?
Oh, send the rock steady out to Freddy
Who juggles plates in Tsing Tao City

'Cause tonight Bo Diddley's in Finland Station - hey, Bo Diddley
Sun Ra's in Omaha
The Skatalites in New York City - hey, Skatalites
The Stooges rule over Habana
The Bhundu Boys rock Acapulco - hey, hey Bhundu Boys
Good hip hop in Islamabad
Ali Farke Toure's in Oaxaca - hey, Farke Toure
And Baaba Maal's all over Stalingrad

Yeah, while some are waking, some are sleeping
From Kamchatka to the Gabon
Above the tradewind, wingtips beating
We calling out for Ronnie and da-do Ron, Ron, Ron

We call the Cumbria to tumble
From the peak of the Himalayas
We send the funk into the jungle
To the last outpost of the bass player



She can't let go this soon
Doesn't feel right
Not tonight
Even though I gave her the stars and the moon
I really think I've got it bad this time around

Baby says yes
But I must confess
It really doesn't seem to matter
'Cause I'd follow that girl all around the world
Even if I never had her
I really think I've got it bad this time around

Gonna show 'em what love can do
Gonna tell 'em 'bout me and you
Gonna show 'em what love can do when it's right
And this time it's right

Love is the light that can shine so bright
But sometimes it fades away
Then you find one that can shine like the sun
And she comes up for you every day
I really think I've got it bad this time around

Oh when the girl is so far away
I can't think of all the right words to say
But now she's here and we are all together



I don't cry, not unless I want to.
Might be somethin' in the air.
Might be that I just don't care.
Might be cuz I lost my baby,
Or it might be my mind, yeah.

Well, you might think that I'm talkin' crazy.
Might even believe its true,
Cuz right now my life's a little hazy.
Can't even put on my shoes.
Might be cuz the worlds gone crazy, darlin',
Or it might be my mind.

Search your soul and you will find
That your heart won't tell a lie.

I can't lie even if I want to.
My momma didn't raise no fool.
Hey, I seen what you go believin',
And I know about the Golden Rule.
Might be cuz I'm a dreamer, baby,
Or it might be my mind

Search your soul and you will find
That your heart won't tell a lie.

Search your soul and you will find
That your heart won't tell a lie.



I took my darling down
To that big grey house down the lane
And then the doctor said
He said it's in her head
She's never going to be right again
I kissed my love goodbye
She didn't blink an eye
They took her down the hall
She never looked back at all
Behind grey walls
Somewhere there's a soul
Behind grey walls
She's out of control
Crying out for help
No one can hear
O Lord have pity on her
O Lord have pity on her
My darling walks the floor
My darling walks the floor
She walks every minute that she can
I heard my darling say
I heard my darling say
She don't know who I am
Cigarette burns down her arm
Said she tried to do herself harm
Tied her arms in  the back
Trussed her up like a sack
I saw my darling's face
I saw my darling's face
It looked so pale in the distance
She stared out from her room
Into the dying gloom
And I saw her poor tears glisten
Pills to keep her calm
More punctures than a junkie in her arm
Tied her down on the bed
Seventy volts through her head
-------------------------------------------------



she used to tell me that I'll be O.K. 
now that I'm standing all on my own 
I've gotta reach inside deep to face this world alone

she used to say you don't listen to reason 
believe in yourself, that's good keep believin' 
cause one day pretty soon we will all understand

With my eyes on the prize
just sitting round strummin' guitar
wasting time.
Now I'm fish in the water
Swimming all the seven seas
Lots of people throw their nets
But they can't catch me
And I know if things go my way
it just a matter of time
So nothing left for me to do
But stay like the altitude and get high, so high.
My fingers sticky like Spiderman,
And here's a quintessential part of my master plan.
Stay blue like the sky
And if my luck changes
it's about that time.
And I know if thing goes my way
it might not be too soon
So nothing left to do but jam
An afternoon on the stoop
while my foot stomps a loop
And the whole world revolves

Problem solved.
And I know that if things go my way
Well it's about that time
So let me rise like the sun
And just shine go for mine.
Rewind and playback another funky hot track
Cause my record consoles
Stacked with ten sides cause I'm like that.
Lemonade I'm drinking
Sinking into this music
Like some country blues,
Ethiopians,
Abyssinians grooves puts me in the state of mind now
I'm zoning.
check the phone off the hook
And cook some Thai noodles for you

and I'm going where the summer never ends
Yes I'm going where the summer never ends

And I know if I play my cards right
I'll get some loving tonight
That's why I chilled the wine
And put the glasses on ice
And put the baby boo boo to bed,
yeah,
Lay your head
And I know if the last summer sun
Sets pink tonight and the stars come out
And the vibes all right
it's just a lil daydream
But I really can't pretend
And I hope someday I find a place
Where summer never ends.




I step on dying kings
I see their bags are packed
with cuts of mirrors
I walk on broken glass
all skin open wide
they take my child
and make me walk in line
in line on broken glass
I walk on broken glass



She'd walk by on her way to work - n' make the air smell so sweet,
I used to sit in a coffee shop - Sometimes I'd have a cup,
And when she'd go by - She'd light up the sky like the sun coming up.

She be standin' by the bus stop - Driver opened up the door,
I'd just sit n' watch her - Gettin' on the 104,
I wanna give her my number - I wanna tell her my name,
Wanna climb on board that cross-town bus,
Take a chance she feels the same.

It's just another East Side story,
Everybody's got a tale to tell,
Like a hundred guys before me,
I fell under her spell,
It's just another East Side story.

Some things you hold on to - n' some you just let go,
It seems like the ones that you can't have are the ones you want the most,
I think about her sometimes - I wonder if she was real,
And if I ever find her I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

It's just another East Side story,
Everybody's got a tale to tell,
Like a hundred guys before me,
I fell under her spell.
Yeah, her spell.

Still the same old story - Still the same old game,
Up there on the East Side - Life goes on the same,
She never knew my number - Never even knew my name,
She climbed on board that cross-town bus I never saw her again.

It's just another East Side story,
Everybody's got a tale to tell,
Like a hundred guys before me,
I fell under her spell,
Her spell, her spell,
Yeah, it's just another East Side story,
Just another East Side Story,
Just another East Side Story.

It's just another East Side story.



I'm numb to the pain that made me sore.

Bring me hate watch me bleed again.
Lie to fate let her break what doesn't bend.

See me as everything I couldn't be.

I am fragile, but I'm strong enough.
I am wanted, enemy number one.
I am lying, cause I never fell.
If you need me, follow me to hell.

I have tried to feel the same as you,
But in the end, I can see, that you lied to.

Obsess me as everything you want to be.

I am fragile, but I'm strong enough.
I am wanted, enemy number one.
I am lying, cause I never fell.
If you need me, follow me to hell.

I came undone as you began to fly.
To be free I'll need my hands tied.

I am fragile, but I'm strong enough.
I am wanted, enemy number one.
I am lying, cause I never fell.
If you need me, follow me to hell



Yeah, would it be enough?
Alright and if I hold my head
Could I hold it all?
Yeah, could I hold it again?
And a heart goes a long way

And if I had it all
And if I had
As she comes screaming after
Oh I say

Who do you think that you are?
Who you think that you are?
What are you trying to do to me?
What you tryin' to do to me?
Well, can't you see?

Hey, alright
Hey and if I had it all
And if I had it all again
Baby, would you come back to me?

Hey, and I tried to get back
To the start when I'm born again
I bet I'm born again
And now I'm really gone

Coke and ice
Coke and ice
Coke and ice
Coke and ice



everything i know

whatever you do
it'll come back to you
i wish there was
a different way of
showing you the truth
but i gotta move



Late again, when I get home you'll be waiting.
Still you know there ain't no use in you complaining.
I know that I can show some respect, especially when I'm wrong.
But when I get back I know you'll say, "You've been away too long."

Ooooh, la-la-la, oooh...

I wonder why I stay when everybody's gone, yeah,
There's always something there, that keeps me hanging on.

Ooooh, la-la-la, oooh...

I wonder why I stay when everybody's gone away,
There's always something there, that keeps me hanging on.

I know that I can show some respect, especially when I'm wrong.
Late again, when I get home you'll be waiting.

My shadow stretches far and free
Yeah
It's telling me what I could be
Could be

Cause I'm tired
Of looking up
All the time

We'll stand on top of the world
Looking down
We'll stand on top of the world
Looking down

Yeah
We'll set ourselves apart in time
Yeah
And then we'll leave it all behind
I'll rise

Cause I'm tired
Of looking out
For the line

We'll stand on top of the world
Looking down
We'll stand on top of the world
Looking down

We'll stand on top of the world

Yeah
Is anybody here like me?
Yeah
Can you face the sound
And decide?

We'll stand on top of the world
Looking down
We'll stand on top of the world
Looking down
We'll stand on top of the world
Looking down
To rise above on our own
Looking down



When I make my money got to get my dime
Sit down with her baby wind is full of trash
She bold as the street light dark and sweet as hash

Way down in the hollow leavin' so soon
Oh, St. Teresa, higher than the moon

Reach down for the sweet stuff feel it rise in me
I know any man sees you like I see
Follow down the side street movin' single file
That's where I will hold you, sleeping like a child

Way down in the hollow, leavin' so soon
Oh, St. Teresa, higher than the moon

Just what I've been needin', feel it rise in me
Every stone a story, like a rosary
Show me my Teresa, just a little climb
When I make my money, got to get my dime

Way down in the hollow, leavin' so soon
Oh, St. Teresa, higher than...

Down in the hollow, leavin' so soon
Oh, St. Teresa, higher than the moon

Oh it seems so long ago
The cuts ran deep
And the scars still show

I live in the shadows
where it's been so hard to grow
I'm still a servant in a noble mans robes

You know my weekness girl, you know my kind
You helped me see when I was blind

It's a crime to live my life without you
Serve out my years in darkness
Inside these walls I die without you
And when I close my eyes
I'm caught in the balance

Afraid of the hurricane
I hide in my domain
I need release from all this pain
Please don't forsake me
In these ruins of your home
I can't wait forever
Don't leave me alone

I have a secret if you want to learn
I will surrender in return

It's a crime to live my life without you
Serve out my years in darkness
Inside these walls I die without you
And when I close my eyes
I'm caught in the balance

You know my weekness girl, you know my kind
You helped me see when I was blind

It's a crime to live my life without you
Serve out my years in darkness
Inside these walls I die without you
And when I close my eyes
I'm caught in the balance

It's a crime to live my life without you
Serve out my years in darkness
Inside these walls I die without you
And when I close my eyes
I'm caught in the balance



Playing games in the rain
The hills and the fortune
Got me fooled again

You see I work in a factory I need the money
I don't want to be late Though I hate this place
I got my debts to pay for Free me from this race
They're going to have to wait

If I ever see you again
I will tell you why Tell you why
I was low and insecure
I didn't want to make you cry

Well my good's turned bad
And it's just my luck that
You're not on my side
So what happens now? Where did you go
With these feelings I hide?

Staying out for the summer!

I've had enough lining
Pockets I've never met
They've got me working all hours
I ain't gained nothing yet

If I ever see you again
I will tell you why Tell you why
I was low and insecure If I ever see you cry
I didn't want to make you cry

Well my good's turned bad
And it's just my luck that
You're not on my side
So what happens now? Where did you go
With these feelings I write?

I'm staying out for the summer
Playing games in the rain
The hills and the fortune
Won't be the same again

I'm staying out for the summer
I'm staying out for the summer
I'm staying out for the summer



But maybe it's the lure of the sea 
Who knows the effect,  
that whisky could've had on me
It could've been the lure of the sea 

'Cause leather ain't as strong as the weather
But leather can strangle any dream
And leather ain't as strong as the weather 
But leather took Curtis from me

Maybe it's the lure of the sea,
maybe it's the lure of the sea
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty
But maybe it's the lure of the sea

Once I felt chained, and now, now I feel free
Maybe it's the lure of the sea
Polo and Da Gama, 
well those two had nothing on me 
Could be I'm a sucker for the sea

'Cause silver, ain't as quick as the tongue
But silver, took the M.L.K so young
And metal ain't as strong as the petal  
But metal left the verse unsung

Maybe it's the lure of the sea,
maybe it's the lure of the sea
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty
But maybe it's the lure of the sea

Freedom's taken a liking to me
Maybe it's the lure of the sea
Look in my eyes 'cause my belt's broke free
Maybe it's the lure of the sea 
The Pirates Of Penzance, 
they have nothing on me
Maybe it's the lure of the sea

Maybe it's the lure of the sea, maybe it's the lure of the sea 
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty
But maybe it's the lure of the sea

Maybe it's the lure of the sea, maybe it's the lure of the sea 
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty
But maybe it's the lure of the sea



Guess who's gonna ring the chimes
That's right, lend me a paper
You know I've change you right

Oh, girl, make it a quick one
I'm only here tonight
I know, sadder but wiser
I'm still the same old guy

Take a look at me
See, I couldn't look no better
Girl, I'm at my peak
And that's a fact, that's a fact

Take a part of me
You know it couldn't feel no better
Take it all with ease
Before you break your back
Or get a heart attack

I'm a wonderful thing, baby
Such a, such a
Wonderful
I'm a wonderful thing, baby
Such a, such a

Goodbye, sorry I can't stay
But I don't have my style
I've got a dozen or more babes
To see before I fly

Hot stuff, beggin' to see me
Why should they really pry?
Come on, give me your blessin'
You're still the first in line

Take a look at me
See, I couldn't look no better
Girl, I'm at my peak
And that's a fact, that's a fact

Take a part of me
You know it couldn't feel no better
Be sure that you breathe
Before you break your back
Or get a heart attack

I'm a wonderful thing, baby
Such a, such a
Wonderful
I'm a wonderful thing, baby, baby
Wonderful

I'm a wonderful thing, baby
Such a, such a, such a wonderful thing

Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Okay, alright, go home
Let's just, let's just start with the A's
I just want you to show you something
Just start with the A's, alright?

Now Aida, right? Anna, right?

Abby, this is Abby, Abby Long

Abby Long, I'm goin' up, eh
Something Boulevard, hey, hey

Hold it, hold it, hold it
I'm a wonderful thing, baby
Vincent, are you ready for some more B's?
Hahaha

I'm a wonderful thing, baby
B's, there's Bonnie, Becca



What does it mean to you
It's a beautiful life

Then I wake up, wonder where my clothes are
Try to find some more stars
And i'm stuck with the same old thing
That I always dream
I light a cigarette and it's not right
Where's my ashtray, where the hell did I put my coffee
I can't find anything

One thing goes wrong and then another
It's a beautiful life, thank you mother
And I've got nothing to lose
It's the same game
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life

When I'm up in the air
When I'm down on the floor
I can use a sharper knife
Is there anything else, is there anything more
This is my beautiful life
And the poetry's crushing me
This is my beautiful life

I put my clothes on to the ground near me
Does anyone know, has anyone found me
I guess I'll just have to wait until the next life
Hang around for the next laugh
I'm part of something, the bigger part of nothing
And I'm debating do I even like me
And everybody's trying so hard to be so cool
But you know what's cool
Not trying

When I'm up in the air
When I'm down on the floor
I can use a sharper knife
Is there anything else, is there anything more
This is my beautiful life
And the poetry's crushing me
This is my beautiful life

I'm crawling across and I can't get out
Will it wash me away
The currents pulling me down
I was looking for love but it's never around
Come on help me out one more time

And I was hoping someone would need me
It's a beautiful life
Everything's broken
Just as it should be
But it's beautiful to me

When I'm up in the air
When I'm down on the floor
I can use a sharper knife
Is there anything else, is there anything more
This is my beautiful life
And the poetry's crushing me
This is my beautiful life

It's a beautiful life
This life

It's a beautiful life
It's mine, my beautiful life

Such a beautiful life

It's a beautiful life

Your life

It's a beautiful life



Two-faced love, will keep me paralysed
Two-faced love, I pace the room at night
Why can't I get you off my mind

Oh I try to dull my feelings down
In every bar in every town
But your eyes follow me around
Why can't I get you off my mind

Face the music, face the facts
Different sides of different tracks
Had my feet on holy ground
Then I helter-skelter down
Confused, or being used
Two-faced love, two-faced love
It feels so wrong it must be right
Two-faced love, two-faced love
Why can't I get you off my mind

Oh, I don't like your thin skin
And I don't like the places you've been
I don't like the mood that you're in
Why can't I get you off my mind

If I read the signals right
I might be your slave tonight
Pardon my naive caress
Tender fits with tenderness
Uncouth to tell the truth
Two-faced love, two-faced love
Feels so wrong it must be right
Two-faced love, two-faced love
Why can't I get you off my mind

Oh you don't make my blood run cold
And you don't fit my jelly mold
Don't come up for air when you're digging for gold
Why can't I get you off my mind
Why can't I get you off my mind
It feels so wrong it must be right
Feels so wrong it must be right



I was a fool just to leave you hanging
If courage is all I need to find you

When will the snow melt away?
And all the pieces will fit together
Now I've got so much to say
And I need you
Gotta find you

Looking for an angel, are you an angel?
Looking for an angel, help!
Calling for an angel, are you my angel?
Calling for an angel, help!

Come back, come back, come back to me

I cannot make it without you
On my knees, oh won't you please
Come back to me?
Come back to me, dear friend.

Looking for an angel, are you an angel?
Looking for an angel, help!
Calling for an angel, are you my angel?
Calling for an angel
Come back to me, dear friend
Come back to me, dear friend
Come back to me, dear friend.

One is for the decent times 
And two is for the same 
Well number three is for the big fat sinners 
And four is heaven's gate 

There's a soul invasion here 
The soul invasion is mine 
Love is in a vacant tree 
I'm going to pick and choose what's mine 

There's a show inside of heaven's gate 
And the sinners are taking a bath 
Heaven is a season and the season is time 
I'm going to sit right back 

Ha ha ha 
Ha ha ha 

With you by my side 
I hardly know I speak the truth 
I'm an easy equation 
As I step inside of heaven's gate 

Here beside heaven's fountains 
I'm washing my hands with time 
I'm washing my legs with truth 
I step inside of heaven's gate 
I walk inside of heaven's gate 
I run inside of heaven's gate 

Ha ha ha

There must be a proof,
I need a reason to survive, to stay alive,
I know what must be done, before the morning comes,
So I look for self-respect, as I reflect,
All the wrecked lives that we live, the waste and greed,
I've been down but not like this before,
Can't take it anymore.

Still small voice,
Rise inside and calm this tortured soul,
Give me just one last choice,
Whisper soothing words and take control of me.

I sit here waiting for a sign, something divine,
Thunder's cracking in my head, I must be dead.
But as the pain subsides, I begin to realise,
There's a gentle tone I hear,
it sounds so clear,
All at once I feel sublime,
The voice is mine,
And will I find myself my way,
And greet a brand new day,

Tell me still small voice,
Rise inside again and calm my soul,
Give me just one last choice,
Whisper soothing words and take control of me.

Still small voice,
Rise inside again and calm my soul,
Give me one more choice,
Whisper soothing words and take control,
Take control of me.



If I told you all my secrets 
Would you care or be scared
And Amy would you believe in me
All the complications that I bring
The complication of you and me

Break the spell cast on me
That I fell through
Smile for me
It's your smile that I run to
The hardest thing to admit
That I love you
Sweet Amy don't let fear 
Take me from you
We'll find a way

Amy please don't cry yourself to sleep
Remember when I kissed you
By the stairwell where we hid
And Amy please just laugh for me
All the distance in between us
Don't let distance now defeat us

I can hardly wait, I can hardly wait
The futures right here
Making no mistake, making no mistake
I can't let go

Break the spell cast on me
That I fell through
Smile for me
It's your smile that I run to
The hardest thing to admit
That I love you
Sweet Amy don't let fear 
Take me from you
We'll find a way

Need you to break the spell
Please will you break the spell?
Won't you break the spell?
God will you break the spell



But your cats just freak me out
And the four of us don't fit in your apartment

You like my accent
And I got drunk with your dad
And his best friend with a gun strapped to his ankle

You fit me perfectly
So in the chorus
I'll sing what it's like to be

Going out and laughing at nothing
Drinking, kissing, pushing and shoving
Staying in bed 'til we get sore
Calling in sick, so we can lay there

You and me
It's you and me

Come to Europe
You can see where I come from
When we get out of bed you can meet my sister

I really like you
Yeah, I really fucking do
It's a good thing we both know that it's a good thing

You and me perfectly
Fit the chorus
So I'll sing what it's like to be

Going out and laughing at nothing
Drinking, kissing, pushing and shoving
Staying in bed 'til we get sore
Calling in sick, so we can lay there

You and me
It's you and me

Going out and laughing at nothing
Drinking, kissing, pushing and shoving
Staying in bed 'til we get sore
Calling in sick, so we can lay there

You and me
It's you and me

Going out and laughing at nothing
Drinking, kissing, pushing and shoving
Staying in bed 'til we get sore
Calling in sick, so we can lay there

It's you and me
It's you and me



I'd like to go to the other side 
Just to think, you were just passin' by 

Ridin' around 
You spat in my eye 
Just to think, you were just passin' by 

We were eye to eye 
Breezing by 
You broke the pace 
Just a twisted kid, never learned to ride 

Now I'd like to get out 
I'd like to go to the other side 
Just to think, you were just passin' by 

We were eye to eye 
Breezing by 
You broke the pace 
Just a twisted kid, never learned to ride 

Now my wheels are off the ground 
They keep spinnin' 'round 
Just to think, you were just passin' by 

Now I'd like to get out 
Go to the other side 
Just to think, you were just passin' by



You're just being totally perfect
On Larry King you said you were  tired
Time to put to bed yr competitive edge
They say you can't say no to Brahma
Now you don't have to try so hard
The label says you don't have to wear less clothes
It's time to take a bubble bath

Hey hey little baby breakdown
Button up baby you come undone
Hey hey little baby get down
Before you fall and hurt someone

You say you need privacy
Broken glass everywhere
Maybe you need an emo boy
No underwear on the director's chair
You are seemingly unconscious
Of what yr body is doing
Like Miss Monroe yr head don't know
Exactly what yr body's doing

Hey hey little baby breakdown
Button up baby you come undone
Hey hey little baby get down
Before you fall and hurt someone

On TV you're soft and whispery
Delicate like angel food cake
They say if you press too hard on it
It will squish into a dense ball
It will lose its fluffiness
That's what you get when you use a box mix
Can you get some satisfaction
How much are you willing to pay?

Hey hey little baby breakdown
Button up baby you come undone
Hey hey little baby get down
Before you fall and hurt someone

What's yr gut feeling about the new deal
How's the label gonna remake you?
How was yr date with Eminem
Did he bake you and then forsake you
Is innocence gonna still overtake you
Like Arthur Doyle they can't fake you
Oh Mariah you are endless
Like the wind, you feel defenseless

Hey hey little baby breakdown
Button up baby you come undone
Hey hey little baby get down
Before you fall and hurt someone



We all got different 
Stories to tell 
It's just because 
We've got it 
Going on over 
And over again 
We've been sleeping 
Through the day 
We seem to have been 
Badly informed 
Salvation through hard lines 
We all know it's about time 
To get up, so wake up! 
Now! 

Everyone hears about it 
We got to talk and overtalk 
You just don't see  
Any difference 
Good riddance to him 
And his Apprenticeship 
I wanna see you get out 
I wanna see this town 
Go up in flames 
Salvation through hard lines 
We all know it's about time to 
Get up, so wake up! 
Now! 

Let's be radical 
In our not being radical 
Let's be careless 
Ignorant and then 
We'll see 
How they feel then 
And respond to what 
We'll have to say



You better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two, it's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She builds you up to just put you down, what a clown

'Cause everybody knows she's a femme fatale
The things she does to please she's a femme fatale
She's just a little tease she's a femme fatale
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks

You're put down in her book
You're number 37, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool, yes it's true

'Cause everybody knows she's a femme fatale
The things she does to please she's a femme fatale
She's just a little tease she's a femme fatale
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks

'Cause everybody knows she's a femme fatale
The things she does to please she's a femme fatale
She's just a little tease she's a femme fatale
Oh-oh-oh she's a femme fatale
Oh-oh-oh she's a femme fatale
Oh-oh-oh she's a femme fatale



I can't believe it's finally here
We said that kiss would be a promise forever
And I can't believe you're going away

Got to let you go
Just like we always said
Got to let you go
Just like we said before

My mind is filled with these memories of you
Your smile deep inside my tears
I wonder if there are roses in heaven
And I wish that I could hold you right here

And when I start to dream 
It's your face, that I see
And when I breathe

Through the years
We shared the tears
That freed us from the yesteryears
We made the sacrafice of time
But never feeling left behind
Standing in the pouring rain
I promise I won't cry again
I know we'll be together soon



But never did a thing about it till I let you in
It's kinda funny, 'bout the time that I was fallin' apart
You came and put me back together now

'Cause what I want and what I need
Has now become the same things
You've been offering as days go by
I've finally become what you want me to be

I still remember all the stupid things that I've said and done
But still you stuck around with me when all your friends said, "Run"
You've given me a name, I found myself inside all the flames
Becoming everything for you again

'Cause what I want and what I need
Has now become the same things
You've been offering as days go by
I've finally become what you want me to be

Don't tell me you saw it all along
God help me, I never knew I belonged
Guess I was wrong

'Cause what I want and what I need
Has now become the same things
You've been offering as days go by
I've finally become what you want me to be

And what I need
Has now become the same things
You've been offering, you've taken me
And shaped me to become what you want me to be, yeah



pass the man who holds the box he'll try to get inside
faces look back at me from their places on the wall
above the girl who held the shiny looking glass

she said
all faces in here, have an undercoat of blue
if you look real close with this glass of mine
you can pick out every hue
i took the glass from her hand and held it to the sky
i took one glimpse, i slipped and fell
into the other side
 
sometimes i can't see how far we've come
sometimes i feel like me body's gone numb
sometimes i can't see how far we've come
but i step back, and i look again
and my chains come undone

back out on the sidewalk now crashing through the night
feel first breath of air bringing in the sun
on the bench ahead a man sat, playing national guitar
i didn't recognize the tune but i dropped change in his jar

the first notes to hit my ears didn't sound quite right
but i let the sound wash over me
and it got me through the night


solo

step inside take a look at the tapestry untied
sadly saw the details that occupy your mind
can you see a picture that is coming into view
the journey started long ago, now see the story through

see, see, see how far we've come
feel, feel, feel what has begun
we can be, be, be headed towards the sun
if we free ourselves from these chains



You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on m my knees
I'm begging you please to come home

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on m my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom making love
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed someone's taken my place
Hahaha

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on m my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Hey, you should know you never treat me too right
Should've come home you shouldn't stay out at night
Think you never know you shouldn't treat me this way
And you know I wouldn't stray

Man, you should've known you could have give me everything
Go down on your knee, you should've put on the ring
Oh deny the rest, to me alone you should sing
And you know I wouldn't stray, no way

Jubilation, she loves me again
I fall on the floor and I laughing
Oh, jubilation, she loves me again
I fall on the floor and I laughing



I used to be so color blind 
You opened up my eyes
Do you want to share your dreams?
See a different side of me 
You're everything I need

I like it when you think out loud
The things you say when you know
There is no one else around
Well I can dig my own graves now
But will you smile every time
I try to crawl my way out

There is no one like you
And in a world of black and white
You are the only one in color
There is no one like you
Into history I slide
I want you to keep it all uncovered
You are the only one in color

You know when to set that mood
You can light up any room
Just by the way you move
The only one who understands
What I've given you you've given back 
Come on and take my hand

I like it when you think out loud
The things you say when you know
There is no one else around
Well I can dig my own graves now
But will you smile every time
I try to crawl my way out

There is no one like you
And in a world of black and white
You are the only one in color
There is no one like you
Into history I slide
I want you to keep it all uncovered
You are the only one in color

You turned an old world upside down
We would've come when I was so tightly wound 
And so full of doubt 
I'll never tell you that two's a crowd 
I know I can't get through without
Ever needing you around

There is no one like you
And in a world of black and white
You are the only one in color
There is no one like you
Into history I slide
I want you to keep it all uncovered

There is no one like you
And in a world of black and white
You are the only one in color
There is no one like you
Into history I slide
I want you to keep it all uncovered
You are the only one in color



You molded with your hands
They send you up that hill
While you wait for change
A clever distraction
You lose your name
And all it's worth
But something does change
We blame the ones we love
A clever lie

I'll keep running after you
But I always seem to stumble over what I've become
I'll keep running after you
There's something healing in the silence when I'm alone with you

His church is the body
But where is the blood
He's centering himself inside
The castles built with mud
He's full of cheap, cheap grace
But as for faith
He has none

I'll keep running after you
But I always seem to stumble over what I've become
I'll keep running after you
There's something healing in the silence when I'm alone with you

Mon Dieu it's a celebration
Cause I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back
I'm coming back
I'm coming back to you

I'll keep running after you
But I always seem to stumble over what I've become
I'll keep running after you
There's something healing in the silence when I'm alone with you

Cause in our faith we come together
And make a change for the better
I was living alone
And I cannot tell you why
But I found out
I love you more



The crying is faint
The same fate overtakes them
The sound rings in the midst
Better days will lie in wait
So i'll endure this till you take me away
Holding close to your hands never slipping through your grip
The road is getting longer and I don't know if i can make it
But I'll hold hoping to get stronger all the while
Calling out, let it pass
Let it drown with the water
Freedom from this place is found in you, it's found in you
I'll be home soon with the letter in my left hand
I'll be home soon cause i'm coming home to you
Chasing the wind
The light that you lead is only a shadow now
But it's bright enough for me to lead you out
So i'll take this until it fades
Until it falls
Until it breaks
And i'll kiss it goodbye
I'll kiss life goodbye
This world goodbye
I'll be home soon
I will be home soon



And now I think that I’ve got it all down
And as I say it louder I love how it sounds
Cause I’m not taking the easy way out
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn’t have to give a reason why…

It’s no surprise I won’t be here tomorrow
I can’t believe that I stayed till today
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we’ll find this was no surprise

It came out like a river once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn’t know how
Held onto it forever just pushing it down
Felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn’t have to give a reason why

It’s no surprise I won’t be here tomorrow
I can’t believe that I stayed till today
There’s nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There’s nothing here in this soul left to say
Don’t be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we’ll find this was no surprise

Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that’s left your eyes
That’s why this comes as no, as no surprise

If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it’s better than where we are now
But after going through this, it’s easier to see the reason why

It’s no surprise I won’t be here tomorrow
I can’t believe that I stayed till today
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we’ll find this was no surprise

The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wrong and right, our memories
The whispering before we sleep, just one more thing that you can't keep
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that’s left your eyes
But I know in time we’ll find this was no surprise



You feel the mosquitoes bite
On your arm
And your legs

Until you
Run for cover
Then you find yourself alone as usual there's no one there
To help you distinguish right form wrong--Yucca man

Anacondas wrapped around your neck--you want respect
But it won't come through your windows or your door
Grab it by the tail

Yucca man
Yucca man

If I had a dollar--cut it in two--give you fifty cents
But the rock will come and get you

Yucca man
Yucca man
Yucca man

Now you are a cannibal
You eat yourself for a supper in a stew
Shut your mouth
Stop gummin'

Yucca man
Yucca man

If I had a dollar--cut it in two--give you fifty cents
But the rock will come and get you

Yucca man
Yucca man
Yucca man
Yucca man

Yucca man
Yucca man
Yucca man
Yucca man



We're on our way
Down to the south east coast
On our holiday

The kids are rowing in the back 
About who's coat flew off the roof rack
We're on our way
We're off on holiday

Hey hey
We're off on holiday
Hey hey

Some seek enlightenment
On the hippy trail
The Great Wall of China
The Head of Kinsale

I'm just as happy with a pot of tea
In a rotten little beach hut by the sea
We're on our way
We're off on holiday

Hey Hey
We're off on holiday
Hey Hey

Now we're away
We're not coming back
Stick your bills and phone calls
And give me the sack
We're on our way

It's only a small place
It's often cold and grey
The beach is made of pebbles
Not many people come this way

But when the temperature's climbing
And the sun is shining
We're on our way
We're off on holiday

Hey Hey
We're off on holiday
Hey Hey
We're off on holiday

We're on our way
Hey Hey
We're off on holiday
Hey Hey
Now look today

Hey Hey
Hey Hey

Holiday

Just saw a dog get hit on the freeway
With my stomach in my mouth
I almost hit a truck driving in the next lane
spent all my money on beer
and i've got rent to pay
I was late again this morning
I'm laying in the bed i've made

If I had a fall out shelter
I could lock myself inside and sleep
somebody could come and drop a bomb on me
maybe then something would change

Lately I can't stand people
They're always rubbing me the wrong way
I don't feel like smiling
It wouldn't look right on my face

That's just the way I feel...

If I had a fall out shelter

That's just the way I feel...
That's just the way I feel...
That's just the way I feel...
That's just the way I feel...

Lately I can't stand people
They're always rubbing me the wrong way
I don't feel like smiling
It wouldn't look right on my face

That's just the way I feel
That's just the way I feel

It's been another bad day
It's been another bad day
It's been another bad day
It's been another bad day

It's been another bad day
It's been another bad day
It's been another bad day
It's been another bad day



She walks like a gunslinger
Laughs through the shots
Got some lead from the hips
She's so hot she can't stop

Oh, yeah

Oh, she loves like a steam train
Out all the time
She fights like a bobcat
Got some fame on her mind

Tell me why
Oh, tell me why

Oh, yeah
Oo, yeah

Fire where the heart is
Sweet home on the range
Call of the wild
See the beast with no name

Tell me why
Oh, tell me why

The world is waiting here for you
Can't you see them anymore?
The world is waiting there for you
Can't you see them anymore, anymore, anymore?

The world is waiting there for you
Don't you just hear it anymore?
The world is waiting there for you
Don't you feel them anymore, anymore, anymore?

She's tall in the saddle
Got a rose in her teeth
She's Hell incarnate
Just walkin' down your street

Oh, oh, yeah

Now, you've seen the line on the glory
From the heart of the flame
From the, I don't know a story
But your song never changed

Tell me why
Oh, tell me why

The world is waiting there for you
Can't you feel it anymore?
The world is waiting there for you
Can't you feel it anymore, anymore, anymore?
My world is waiting there for you
Can't you feel him anymore?
The world is waiting there for you
Can't you feel him anymore, anymore, anymore?

Yes, oh, yes, oh, yeah

Oo, yeah, yeah

Shoot, shoot
She walks like a gunslinger
Shoot, shoot
Oh, will I see your shots
Shoot, shoot
Mm, she walks like a gunslinger
Shoot, shoot
Oh, she laughs, laughs, laughs

Oo, no love from the hips now
Oo, she got lead from the hips now

Now, lead, hot lead, hot lead



Say Amen. Close the door.
She gave as much as she had to give
Please don't ask for more
Please don't ask for more
That's all. The curtain's down.
The lights are up. Go home.
Did I care?
Was I in love?
In love enough to know
In love enough to know

There's precious few that line that road
She welled from deep and overflowed
There's no cup to hold the past
Too rich to drink, too rich to last
That's all

Well, you wish
But don't wish for me
As if a wish
Could cheat the fall
Oh just believe
And leave it be
There's beauty in what's brief 
There's beauty in what's small
That's all

There's some who dare and some who shine
And some who only drag behind
And some who reap what others sow
When memories fail well who's to know

That's all. That's all there was.
Say Amen. Close the door.
She gave as much as she had to give
Oh please don't ask for more
Please don't ask for more
That's all



Only listen if you're blue 
If you are married and you are happy 
This song is not to do with you 

If you're listening at your work place 
Feeling small amongst the men 
Do not sing this to your workmates 
This song is not to do with them 

But if you're sitting on a barstool 
Wondering what on earth to do 
Don't let them tell you no-one cares 
This songs one especially for you 

If you are listening on your radio 
Smiling while you drive along 
Tune the band into another 
Because this song is not your song 

If you're working as a DJ 
Leave this record in its sleeve 
Cause this one's not for general airplay 
This song's for the day she leaves 

If you've bought this and you're sinking 
And I think that you know who 
It matters not the mouth that's singing 
This song's one especially for you 

So this goes out to the lonely 
So this goes out to the sad 
And it goes out to the only 
One you felt you ever had 

If you're there in total darkness 
With a letter in your hand 
Do not bother with the letter 
Just listen to the band 

So only buy this if you're lonely



Ramona
... I become alive
We're through
Ramona

I'm gonna wait by your side
I've got five thousand dollars
And I want to take you home
I got five thousand dollars
You won't be leaving here alone

There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
Yeah

I get off
Ramona
... to let you down
You know there's just enough lovin'
In this heart of mine
To do it with you one more time

We're gonna shout
Ramona
We're gonna cry
We're gonna celebrate
You know that there is no tomorrow
So none of this can't wait

There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
Yeah

Here's to you
Ramona
We're going down in flames
I don't praise
Ramona
Well did it ...
It's just down by the river
They call it the Bitter End
There is a place down by the river
You know they call it the Bitter End

There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
Yeah

I got just this one chance
To redeem myself



Making our way, expanding day
The storm moved on, we're holding strong
She can see you, through and through

Let it go
Before the sounds of worlds breaking
Five hundred billion hearts were aching
Let it go
And you were there, time couldn't care

Let it go
A tidal wave of love courageous
Pulls you in the darkest stages
Let it go
And you were there, we'd start the show
The flood of love is here

Beyond the pale cerulean veil
Dancing with friends, the ravens attend
The lights go by, sunflower skies
Fly to the sun, return for the fun

Let it go
Before the sounds of worlds breaking
Five hundred billion hearts were aching
Let it go
And you were there, time couldn't care

Let it go
A tidal wave of love courageous
Pulls you in the darkest stages
Let it go
And you were there, we'd start the show
The flood of love is here

All the pain and all the glory
Fade into a brighter story
And all the angels born of starlight
Through the maze of hearts divided

Just to be here now

Let it go
Before the sounds of new worlds breaking
Five hundred billion hearts were aching
Let it go
A tidal wave of love courageous
Pulls you in the darkest stages
Let it go
Before the sounds of worlds breaking
Five hundred billion hearts were aching

The flood of love is here
The flood of love is here



And I'm selfish to complain
Cause you've always got the best excuse

There's no use in forcing you to stay-
You'd kick my weak butt, anyway
I'll watch you on the evening news

It's just that I see you next to zero-
It's so hard lovin a super hero

You're too busy saving the world
And I think I need saving the most
I know that you'd stay here if you could
But you're too busy saving the world

You're sliding on my favorite boots
And those tights are such a tease
But you never wear that stuff for me

Look up in the sky
It's not a bird or a plane
It's the sweetest crime fighter that I've ever seen-
I just wish she'd call in sick
And just stay home

So go and make the world just a little safer-
I'll read all about it in tomorrow's paper

You're too busy saving the world
And I think I need saving the most
I know that you'd stay here if you could
But you're too busy saving the world

I'm so over jumping off buildings
You catching my fall
So I'll brush up on my Super Villain
And I might see you more

I know you're undercover
But I want you under the covers
It doesn't feel like I'm asking a lot...

You're too busy saving the world
And I think I need saving the most
And I know that you'd stay here if you could
But you're too busy saving the world



And my feet on the floor 
Twenty people knocking 
'Cause they're wanting some more 

Let me in, baby 
I don't know what you've got 
But you'd better take it easy 
This place is hot 

So glad we made it 
So glad we made it 
You got to 
Gimme some lovin' 
Gimme some lovin' 
Gimme some lovin' 
Every day 

Well, I feel so good 
Everything is sounding hot 
Better take it easy 
'Cause the place is on fire 

Been a hard day 
And I don't know what to do 
Wait a minute, baby 
It could happen to you 

So glad we made it 
So glad we made it 
You got to 
Gimme some lovin' 
Gimme some lovin' 
Gimme some lovin' 
Every day 

Well, I feel so good 
Everybody's getting high 
Better take it easy 
'Cause the place is on fire 

Been a hard day 
Nothing went too good 
Now, I'm gonna relax, honey 
Everybody should 

So glad we made it 
So glad we made it 
You got to 
Gimme some lovin' 
Gimme some lovin' 
Gimme some lovin' 
Every day



Don't answer the phone, let the doorbell ring 
I sleep all day, lay awake at night 
I've lost all sense of time 

Visions haunting through my mind 
My fridge is half empty, afraid of outside 
I stare at the wall, feel cold in bed 
I've gotta get out of here 

Won't you save my life tonight? 
Just stay with me and I'll be okay 
Won't you just hold on to me? 
Please excuse the state I'm in and 
heal my mind, hold on to me 
Won't you save my life 
tonight? 

Tonight... 

Empty where it used to shine 
I watch the clock, I'm killing time 
It's you I see in my hour of need 
Bringing back light to me 

Won't you save my life tonight? 
Just stay with me and I'll be okay 
Won't you just hold on to me? 
Please excuse the state I'm in and 
heal my mind, hold on to me 
Won't you save my life 
tonight? 

Everything is breaking down on me 
I dial your number, I've got to breathe 
Everything's locked up, I can't see 
Come on over 
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me 

Won't you save my life tonight? 
Just stay with me and I'll be okay 
Won't you just hold on to me? 
Please excuse the state I'm in and 
heal my mind, hold on to me 
Won't you save my life 
tonight? 

Tonight... 

Won't you save my life tonight? 
Won't you just hold on to me?



Around it swims around my head
All of us are lonley souls
And all of get left for dead

How come I always try to cross
Even though I know the bridge is burning?
How come I take it
When I know that you fake it?
I tell myself I'm learning

The lies that I believe are simple
The lies that I believe are true
The lies that I believe are so beautiful
The lies that I believe are true

All the flings and all the flaws
Let me cling to someone's clause
All of us are lonely souls
And all of us mend broken laws

How come I always try to cross
Even though I know the bridge is burning?
How come I take it
When I know that you fake it?
I tell myself I'm learning

The lies that I believe are simple
The lies that I believe are true
The lies that I believe are so beautiful
The lies that I believe are true

Everyone uses, everyone abuses
Nobody takes the blame
Everyone uses, everyone abuses
Ain't it such a shame

The lies that I believe are simple
The lies that I believe are true
The lies that I believe are so beautiful
The lies that I believe are true



Step right up to the freaky intangible
Hands uncuffed, take the leash on this animal
Hippies getting high fee, hit me with a night-c

Step right into your stripper shoes
Roll the dice, I got snake-eyes and déjà-vu
Popping off, fire melted with bally-hoo
Tune in, tune in, turn on, drop out

Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
With hoes and gigolos
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me

Quick, slow, high or low
You never gonna know for sho'
See in stereo
Down the rabbit hole

Catnip and honey
See it happen all over town
Houses are candy
Build 'em up and then burn 'em down
It melts in your face, not in your amour-all
It starts in the bass and it ends in the crystal ball, yeah

Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
With hoes and gigolos
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me

Disco rodeo
My kaleidoscope
Cleopatra knows
What's down the rabbit hole

Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
With hoes and gigolos
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me

Quick, slow, high or low
You never gonna know for sho'
See in stereo
Down the rabbit hole

Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?



Place where I once used to be
No where doing nothing
People there were made of steel
Tiny cogs in one big wheel
Turning never learning

Had to make a break
And soon I had to wake up feeling stronger, feeling stronger
In my island of dreams, with impossible schemes

In a Shanghai Noodle Factr'y
Place where I once used to be
No where doing nothing
People there were made of cans
Packed like roosters in a pen
Crowing, never knowing

Had to make a break
I knew I couldn't fake it any longer
Everything just aches
Soon I'd have to wake up feeling stronger, feeling stronger
In my island of dreams, with impossible schemes



Although you never
Loved me with your heart
I've come to understand
The fact that you just
Love me as a friend

Hear the voices in my mind
Still I'm messing with my heart
Until I'm going crazy
And now I know

Got stuck on a battlefield
go on back off o-oh
It's not real
My mind is a fighter's shield
But I'm not made of steel

Got stuck on a battlefield
it's right so wrong o-oh
And it feels like poison
Still I'm standing tall
Still I'm standing tall

Illusionary dreams
Pass through my veins and
Suggest your feelings might change
But your kisses never last
We have no future
And barely had a past

Every single time we touch
Feel I need you way too much
Until I'm going crazy
And now I know

Got stuck on a battlefield
go on back off o-oh
It's not real
My mind is a fighter's shield
But I'm not made of steel

Got stuck on a battlefield
it's right so wrong o-oh
And it feels like poison
Still I'm standing tall



Baby, come see
And if you lose your way
Just hold on to me
The flames have all died out
Our hearts are still beating
The rain is gone
The rain is gone

Just look around

Our time is not up
Our place is in the sun
So just wipe the ashes from your eyes, Girl-
There's so much work to be done
And there's no way to be sure
Just be sure to keep breathing
We'll just keep movin' on
We'll keep movin' on

And look around

We're not o. k
But, Baby- we're alright
So just make love to the day
And hold each other tight
Just remember your song
Don't forget to keep singing
Cause our love is a bomb
Our love is a bomb

Just look around
Keep your eyes open, it's alright
Keep your eyes open, it's alright
Make better years from bitter days-
This is our time, This is our place
Look Around

Just look around



When my life is in the balance, neither peace nor morals wake 
Telling me my life is easy, debauched and thirdly heaven sent 
My heart was never theirs but this Christianity will decide 

I'm bruised and left alone 
I get to feel so sad 
People say that I was sad 
People say that I was bad 
People walking around with other feelings they never like to contemplate 
Reacing out for love but would never say 
The chirches have a network leading to the sect and to the soul 
They levitate their founder's faith up to a higher ground while we stay home 

I am a wicked man 
I will not be this unsound 
I was a wretched man before I filled this hole 
When Jesus was upon his cross he never was this alone 

Do do do do do 

They're playing on our weaknesses and changing every sound 
Who could find the right solution when they're being drowned 
Har de har the vacant talk can make you see their ways 
Now check your faith and sleep with love 
The modern way 
Now is that love 
Christianity has nothing for me 

Do do do do do 

This Jerusalemic holy ground is only fit for mealy mouths 
Whose contamination breeds subordination 
I've said too many times but who leads that kind of life 
When my time comes around who will plead my innocence 
And I resent that these things I do 
And I resent that these things are true 
And I resent that these things I do 

Do do do do do

Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop

Southern trees bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit indeed, strange fruit indeed



There's something different in your eyes
It's a complicated notion
Knowing when to open my mouth and let my words flow freely
And I'm watching the sky tonight

The stars fall on
Whenever I'm around you
The stars fall on
A million miles away
Like me, they're falling at the words you say

I'm asking for a second chance
Praying that you'll understand
It's a self-destructive habit
Constantly protecting myself, never saying how I feel
And I'm watching the sky tonight

The stars fall on
Whenever I'm around you
The stars fall on
A million miles away
Like me, they're falling at the words you say



Put your head on the pillow - Let me keep ya warm,
I wanna run my hands across your face,
Yeah lyin' beside ya' - Still the perfect place.

Oh babe - We're still goin' strong,
So glad that you came along,
Yeah babe in every way,
You're still beautiful to me,
I just have to say,
You're still beautiful to me,
So beautiful baby.

Lay back baby - Close your eyes,
Let me do everything your heart desires,
When I think of the years makin' love to you,
There still ain't nothin' that I'd rather do,
Yeah there's somethin' I can't deny,
You sure know how to move this guy,
Yeah babe in every way - You're still beautiful to me,
I just have to say,
You're still beautiful to me - Can't ya see babe.

Yeah - Still feels good - Still runs deep,
When you get close babe - I still get weak,
'Cause in these arms - Is where you belong,
We're still goin' strong - So glad that you came along,
Hey babe you're still number one.

Can't ya see - You're still beautiful to me,
Yeah you'll always be - So beautiful to me.

Yeah, ahh huh.

In every way - You're still beautiful to me.

And it still feels good - Yeah,
Still feels good - Still runs deep,
Lay back - Close your eyes,
Everything that your heart desires.

Yeah, Yeah, it still runs deep,
I can't believe my eyes,
It's just you and me, 
You're so, so beautiful to me babe,
Lay back, close your eyes.



there's nowhere to run to and nothing to stop you
and no one to hold you down

look up my friend, means justify the end
there's nothing below you
when the world falls away

pull over to the shoulder
i've got something to say to you
it's not so elusive this golden frontier
pull the strings puppeteer

sometimes you get marooned
with salt in every wound
you watch as your own hands
reach for the nightstand
for something to bring you down

look up my friend, the dead will soon ascend
but everyone's even
when the light fades away

pull over to the shoulder
i've got something to say to you
it's not so elusive this golden frontier

pull over to the shoulder
i've got something to say to you
this world can get colder this time of the year

and love can disappear
run you through like a spear
pull the strings puppeteer



And we both know
I'm not about to bury myself
Sinking in my footsteps
But not coming up for air
A firm foundation of beating hearts
Is blistering enough on the surface
Closing in and holding out my breath
Hoping to mend the wounds
Opened by years of digging out
We fight fire with fire
And you'll run back to your 
Circles of friends
They won't help you now
We drew a line in the sand
And this time it's now or never
Go ahead and burn your bridges
But only if you can swim
Deep in the sea of disbelief
This time your screams won't be heard
You will fight this battle
But we'll take you out so quickly
That you and your so-called army 
Couldn't see us coming
Fight this battle
We'll tear you down to the ground
We can't stop now
We were born for battle
Without vision we will die
We were born for battle
Against the tide of compromise
There is life in this
The places so close can take you so far
We won't trust our eyes to keep us there



You came to me with this and now I've been robbed 
I bit off my fingertips and why'd I even get involved 
gave all i had to give but that wasn't good enough but that wasn't good enough 
lift yourself off that shelf you're not in this alone no matter how hard you fall 
swallowed all your razor blades so you could do no harm accepted all the blame and tell me where did we go wrong? 
and tell me where did we go wrong 
no matter how hard you did your bestand made this mess 
ignored it all alone this broken valley's a part of us all gave all i gave all i had to give







She was ready to fall down
Carryin on her sledge
Enough booze put ten truckers down

& she went down on a smutty dance
& the uptown crowd said
It's an offence
To any human dance

When the music stop
She kept on doin the Rock
Boss said: "It's time to go"
She started dancin' like AC

She was crawlin' on the floor
When the joint closed doors
They left her lyin in the street
Cause her heart didn't beat anymore

Dancin' on the lonesome bop
She got a broken heart
Once dancin' on the lonesome bop
Bop bop bop



I wanna come back to life..
But i'm not sure how...
So i'm falling into your water..

Take me deeper...deeper in silent...
Why bother..we've been here all along..
Waiting for faith to fall..but light...
This burn is changing me from a poison to purpose..
And the thought is poetry...

This awakening...it starts with a fallout...
Silence became my crutch and i...
I got by without knowing enough..
So much conviction as i..as i paced this room...

The mystery in me is on display for hundreds to see...
But now i think its time..
Time for that change the mystery in me is on display..
For a hundred to see love like fire..
This is our prayer you know i'd die...
Just to be with you



I feel myself slowing down
What does it mean?
The air has changed
It's getting harder to breathe
Or so it would seem
Sail me away to a distant shore
Where everything's fine

A thousand years
Lost in the blink of an eye
If the sky keeps fallin'
The world will come tumblin' down
In a thousand years

Tell me my friend
Can you imagine a place
Free of boundaries and lies
There's blood on the wind
And it's come all of the way
From faraway skies
Take me away to a different world
Where everything's fine

A thousand years
Lost in the blink of an eye
If the sky keeps fallin'
The world will come tumblin' down
In a thousand years
A thousand years
One day for every life
Just keep on going
We'll find you a home underground
In a thousand years

Sail me away to a distant shore
Where everything's fine

A thousand years
Lost in the blink of an eye
If the sky keeps fallin'
The world will come tumblin' down
In a thousand years

A thousand years
One day for every life
Just keep on going
We'll find you a home underground
In a thousand years



I promise you - All my life I will live for you - We will make it through.

Forever - We will be,
Together - You and me,
Oh and when I hold ya - Nothin' can compare,
With all of my heart - Ya know I'll always be right there.

I believe in us - Nothin' else could ever mean so much,
You're the one I trust,
Our time has come - We're not two people now we are one,
Yeah you're second to none.

Forever - We will be,
Together - A family,
The more I get to know ya - Nothin' can compare,
With all of my heart - Ya know I'll always be right there.

Forever - We will be,
Together - Oh just you and me,
The more I get to know ya - The more I really care,
With all of my heart - Ya know I'll always be,
Ya know I really love ya - Nothin' can compare,
For all of my life - Ya know I'll always be,
Right there.



Gotta tell it to you pa
Gotta tell it to the teacher
Gotta tell it to the preacher

DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T
DON'T UPSET ME

Say it to the cops
Say it to the company
Everything is RED
Buzzin in my head

EVERYTHING IS RED
DON'T BOTHER ME

Here comes my 19th
Nervous breakdown
I'm goin' downtown
To the merry go round

I got on a black cat bone
This B.C bone weights 16T
I got on a big black gun
This big black gun
I'm gonna use it son

I'm warnin' all the neighbours
I'm warnin' Mr Landlord
I'm warnin' all you suckers
I'm hangin' loose & I'm Bored

MAD MAN'S DEAD

They said it, on the radio
There've been some kind of rodeo
People get out of under your bed
Don't be afraid:

MAD MAN'S DEAD



Together they made history: So I was born of course 
They baptized me - In hell fire 
They made my heart ---- Out of barbed wire 
What's my name? Just a ghost with a face? 
Or an outcast from - the human race? 
With both ends buming, l burn brightest 
I am the new breed, and you will be the dust 

Because I'm different, because I'm free 
Because I'm everything you wish to be 
Because I'm not afraid of tempting fate 
Because I'm always willing to lake the bait 

I see you through my monster's eyes 
It shows me what you want to hide 
I am the horrible truth; yes the bastard son 
The bad conscience of everyone 
And though l may be - Ripped and torn 
Just an object - Of your scorn 
I'm ready to provoke and be provoked 
My will is strong, it cant be broke 

All right now this is it! 
You know my secret 
All right now this is it! 
All right now this is it!



Yeah I'm hard
I'm hard like an oak

Don't you know that I feel hard
Yeah, I'm hard
I'm hard as an oak

Well I tried to hold you, baby
But it won't stop
It has gotten me
Can't you see?

Now you're looking for a soft place on me
But there's no such place on my body
Can't you see?

And I'm sharp
Yeah, I'm sharp
Sharp as a knife
You can use me to cut with

When you show your teeth, baby
When you show pearly white

Well I tried to hold you, baby
But it won't stop
It has gotten me
Can't you see?

Now you're looking for a soft place on me
But there's no such place on my body
Can't you see?

Well, I'm just saying this because you should know
Well I'm just right when you say I'm wrong
I'm right when you say I'm wrong

I'm tired of foolin' around on the floor, babe
We had some good times
You know what I mean, didn't we?



Where marchers' bodies lately fell
More marchers marching heavy-heeled
Release more spores that march as well

Across the twilit charnel ground
And over long-bewildered farms
Through palaces, where not a sound
Is heard, though there should be alarms

But winter comes and only ice
Is crushed beneath the marching feet
In all the land where once was rice
There now is nothing fit to eat

Except mushrooms which nourish not
The body, nourish not the mind
And often poison, eating rot
The marchers march insane and blind



He'd brought the tea 
They'd both brought along a sick-bag just in case 

The plate of chicken sandwiches 
Were lovely they agreed 
And I watched him spit the bits into her face 

'Do you love me like you used to' he sighs 
'I love you twice as much' she replies 
They were on the train to Venice, where else? 
I think tonight I fancy myself 

I'd rather drink that toast to my own health 
I think tonight I'd rather love myself 
And if you drink that drink to your own health 
I think tonight I'd rather love myself 

Later in the evening 
The sun came rolling down 
And they talked about their fantasies and fears 

Between the heavy breathing 
And those lighter licking sounds 
I heard him whisper this question in her ear 

'Would you still love me if I lost my legs?' 
'I'd see that you were loved and you were fed' 
'I end up in a car crash almost dead' 
'For richer and for partly severed head' 

I'd rather drink that toast to my own health 
I think tonight I'd rather love myself 
And if you drink that drink to your own health 
I think tonight I'd rather love myself 

The neighbours ask them out but they flatly refuse 
'We're saving up for a world-wide cruise' 
With a choice between loneliness and love-sick QE2's 
Well tonight I choose - self-abuse 

A four-pack in the fridge 
A good book on the shelf 
I think tonight I'd rather love myself



To add a simple sum
Either you are simply beautiful
Or I am simply dumb

Dumb, dumb, dumb

It doesn't take Robert The Bruce
To see the web you've spun
Either you are simply beautiful
Or I am simply dumb

Dumb, dumb, dumb

It doesn't take a labrador
To show a blind man sun
Either you are simply beautiful
Or I am simply dumb

Dumb, dumb, dumb

The sun, the sky, the moon, the stars
Jupiter, Neptune and Mars
All these things I clearly see
It don't take a telescope for you to love me

Dumb, dumb, dumb



Spills it's guts all over the road
Excuse me, I had to smile
Lost my grip too for a while
Easy there, steady now
Easy there, steady now
She didn't have the decency 
To sweep away what's left of me
I don't have the presence of mind
To walk along in a straight line
Easy there, steady now
I call your name
I call it loud
I see your face 
In every crowd
Nosebleed down the bathroom wall
Leaves a pool down in the stall
I wonder where you are tonight
Red dress, skin so white
Easy there, steady now
3 AM an empty town
Doctor Martens echo down
Old man Heartbreak follows you
Corruption's shadow swallows you
Easy there, steady now
Jackknife with a precious load
Spills it's guts all over the road
Excuse me, I had to smile
Lost my grip too for awhile
Easy there, steady now



You think you're clever but you haven't a clue
what can you do?

A two watt light bulb is brighter than you
I'm sick and tired of people like you

You want it, you got it
Come take it, it's over here
You want it, you got it
Come take it, is that not clear?
You want it, you got it
Come take it, I'll do it for you
You want it, you got it
Come take it, just cross the line

The moral of the adventure is this
Take me for granted you are taking the piss
Who love is this?

I'd rather wind up with nothing at all
Than take a loser like you through it all

You want it, you got it
Come take it, it's over here
You want it, you got it
Come take it, is that not clear?
You want it, you got it
Come take it, I'll do it for you
You want it, you got it
Come take it, just cross the line

Cross the line x2

You want it, you got it
Come take it, it's over here
You want it, you got it
Come take it, is that not clear?
You want it, you got it
Come take it, I'll do it for you
You want it, you got it
Come take it, just cross the line

Why loser, die
Why loser, why?
Why loser, die
Why loser?



my heart was all but slowing down.
but I could barely make out the sound.
It was my personal symphony.

Striking the chords for only me.
There was a coursing all through my veins.
Another chance to get away, oh!

Until this empty place is filled, I'll keep pretending.

Hey! Wait! Knock me down, and I'll get up again.
Oh! Pain! A remedy that can erase your sting.
I'll keep holding, and I'll keep trying,
I feel this fight, it is slowly dying now but i feel painless.

These days and nights blend into one,
but one more night is all I need.
Another chord from the symphony.
To float above the world for now,
to lose control is bliss somehow.
And wring the color from the grey,
another chance to get away, oh.

Until this empty place is filled, I'll keep pretending.

Hey! Wait! Knock me down, and I'll get up again.
Oh! Pain! A remedy that can erase your sting.
I'll keep holding, and I'll keep trying,
I feel this fight, it is slowly dying now but i feel painless.

All these reckless nights, have left me spinning out of control.
Is there not a cure for sorrow?
All these fading lights, have made me search for something more.
Will there be a new tomorrow?

Until this empty place is filled, I'll keep pretending.

Hey! Wait! Knock me down, and I'll get up again.
Oh! Pain! A remedy that can erase your sting.
I'll keep holding, and I'll keep trying, tonight.

Hey! Wait! Knock me down, and I'll get up again.
Oh! Pain! A remedy that can erase your sting.
I'll keep holding, and I'll keep trying,
I feel this fight, it is slowly dying now but i feel painless.



So convincingly real
Things can seem so amazing
'Til you get up close
And see they're no big deal
Like the stars in the sky
Or the one on the stage
Just a big ball of gas
And a regular guy
Fresh out of minimum wage

In a jackalope space
On a jackalope high
I'm staring you down
Creepy jackalope eye

Many things in this life
Are not what they appear
Yeah I look like a hare
But if you stop and you stare
I'm related to a deer

I got a jackalope face
I'm a jackalope guy
And I'm staring you down
Creepy jackalope eye

Is it so hard to imagine
Is it so hard to believe
Something so outrageous
Something so far fetched
Well how 'bout Adam and Eve?

I know you gotta have faith
I know the need to hope
But the truth is always in place
It's right in front of my face
The mighty jackalope
Yeah

In a jackalope space
On a jackalope high
I'm staring you down
Creepy jackalope
And I'm staring down
Creepy jackalope
And I'm staring you down
Creepy jackalope eye
Freaky jackalope eye
Creepy jackalope eye
Creepy jackalope eye



That we started to flow
How can you be a flower?
When you're fighting the power
With my hands on your hips
I'm caressing your lips
Your exceptional baby
And adorable baby
She lives out of her handbag
With no life in her phone
I see her breaking down
And she's all on her own
When we go out to party
Only once in a while
You're adorable
And exceptional baby
You got me right where you want
Not where I want to be
I got you right where I want you
Not where you want to be
Don't get out of your mind
Like most people we know
You're exceptional baby
And I want you to know

With my hands on your hips
I'm caressing your lips
Your adorable baby
And exceptional baby

Take me down to the river
That we started to flow
How can you be a flower?
When you're fighting the power
When we go out to party
Only once in a while
You're adorable
And exceptional baby
Don't get out of your mind
Like most people we know
Your adorable baby
And exceptional baby
With my hands on your hips
I'm caressing your lips
Your adorable baby
And exceptional baby
Your adorable baby
And exceptional baby



Sing a song that I can't capture
I'll make it up to you somehow

High my hat was hung there for a while
On a pole set up Norwegian style
Ready to show them what I can
Little bird came flying by
And as northern flames light up the sky
That bird was singing out of range
And I got lost into a haze
He couldn't pick me up so I took him down
To be the centre of my crown
And I thought he'd make the change
He was singing out of range

Wild bird flying
Sing a song I can't capture
I'll make it up to you
Wild bird flying
Sing a song I can't capture
I'll make it up to you
If you can understand and now
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow

You know it will never be the same
Truly wild will never tame
And I think it is a shame

Cuz all of the sudden he stopped singing his song
I lost my mind and all went wrong
I've got a heavy hand

Wild bird flying
Sing a song I can't capture
I'll make it up to you
Wild bird flying
Sing a song I can't capture
I'll make it up to you
If you can understand and now
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
Wild bird flying
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
Wild bird flying
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
Wild bird flying
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
Wild bird flying
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow

A doubtful voice divides my faith
My independence only hesitates
An unsure choice I can't embrace
You're gonna have to carve me,
Carve me from stone
Right to the bone or
I'll end up alone
Playing the role
Of someone in control

Why do I rush to slow down
Why do I rush to slow down everything
Why do I rush to slow down
Why do I rush to slow down everything

Will the dice ever roll
When will I ever know
Will the plot ever twist
Or will I still resist
I've been playing the part of a lost realist

My independence is turning the page
Tomorrow comes we start to fade
My independence only complicates
It's not enough to meet half way

You'll have to carve me
Carve me from stone
Right to the bone
Or I'll end up alone
Playing the role
Of someone in control

Why do I rush to slow down
Why do I rush to slow down everything
Why do I rush to slow down
Why do I rush to slow down everything

Will the dice ever roll
When will I ever know
Will the plot ever twist
Or will I still resist
I've been playing the part of a lost realist

I only keep what I give away
I only keep what I give away

Why do I rush to slow down
Why do I rush to slow down everything
Why do I rush to slow down
Why do I rush to slow down
Everything

Will the dice ever roll
When will I ever know
Will the plot ever twist
Or will I still resist
I've been playing the part of a lost realist

Why do I rush to slow down
Why do I rush to slow down everything
Why do I rush to slow down



Yeah we're one cigarette away sure has been fun
One cigarette away we gotta find some place to stay
Because we're one cigarette away from being done.

One drink so quickly turns into another.
Its gonna take me all day tomorrow to recover.
Over has been hung, the last fag has been bummed.
And we're one cigarette away from being done.

guitar solo

Yeah we're one cigarette away from being done.
Whats that light in the window, is that the sun?
Well we're one cigarette away there ain't no use for dumping out the ashtray.
Because we're one cigarette away from being done.
One cigarette away from being done.



Twice a day it's right on time
My heart's like a stopped clock
Twice a day it's right on time

Let's dance, 'til the music's over

My hands are too empty
Gonna need something to do
My hands are too empty
Let me fill them up with you

Let's dance, 'til the music's over
Let's dance, like there's no tomorrow

If you could walk along this road
I'd walk alone, I'd walk along with you
If you could see inside this heart of glass
You'd see how much I see in you
When all of this is over we'll be
Standing in the dark, just me and you
'Til the music's over

All we have
Is all we have we need to know
Stay with me
Until the pink dawn light begins the show

Let's dance, 'til the music's over
Let's dance, like there's no tomorrow

If you could walk along this road
I'd walk alone, I'd walk along with you
If you could see inside this heart of glass
You'd see how much I see in you
When all of this is over we'll be
Standing in the dark, just me and you
'Til the music's over







But you know that's not a passport to me

It's seems secondary to the official reasons I have
But you know they're not right
They're not supposed to be right

Such a royal misfit
You demand the highest respect
Such a royal misfit
Your demands should be higher

It wasn't weird it wasn't nothing
Curious at all but nothing so high
It wasn't weird it wasn't nothing
It wasn't nothing

Moments follow one another without belonging
Moments follow one another without belonging
Moments follow one another without belonging
Moments follow one another without belonging

First and foremost what you know isn't everything you are
Or everything you know it to be

It seems secondary that the real real reason I have
When you know it's not right
It's not supposed to be right

Such a royal misfit
You demand the highest respect
Such a royal misfit
Your demands should be higher

It wasn't weird it wasn't nothing
Curious at all but nothing so high
It wasn't weird it wasn't nothing
Curious at all but nothing so high
It wasn't weird it wasn't nothing
Curious at all but nothing so high
It wasn't weird it wasn't nothing
It wasn't nothing

Moments follow one another without belonging
Moments follow one another without belonging
Moments follow one another without belonging
Moments follow one another without belonging

Everything you are won't last longer
Everything you are won't last longer
Won't last longer
Won't last longer



a beautiful dream.
I want to hold you 
in the dark
it would seem
that no one sees me like you do
no one moves the way you move
and I can't see anything else
I want to take you now. 
Honestly, you're killing me.

And we're drinking
cheap champagne alone in my room
drinking
your name, you wear my favorite perfume
cheap champagne
the flowers in bloom
drinking your name
champagne.

Champagne

If I was stronger
I would take down the moon
we could hang it up
in the corner of your bedroom
and if at night you could not sleep
you could watch it shine
like counting sheep
and only I'll know where the moon has gone.

I want to take you now. 

Honestly, your killing me.

We're drinking
cheap champagne alone in my room
drinking
your name, you wear my favorite perfume
cheap champagne
the flowers in bloom
drinking your name
champagne.

Sitting on the floor of a spinning room
the morning sun won't be coming too soon
it's the way you look in that dress 
there's nothing I can taste that compares to you
and nothing I can say that's quite as true 
as the gift you are. I confess...

That I... I...
I want to dream you
a beautiful dream.
I want to hold you 
in the dark
it would seem
that no one sees me like you do
no one moves the way you move
and I can't see anything else

Champagne with you in my room
drinking
your name, you wear my favorite perfume
cheap champagne
the flowers in bloom
drinking your name
champagne.
cheap champagne with you in my room
drinking
your name, you wear my favorite perfume
champagne
the flowers in bloom
drinking your name

Gonna take a little walk around the woods
Don't care what we do, as long as I'm with you
Every lil' thing gonna be alright

Girl you look good, so good to me
I want you to stay
I don't want you to leave
Don't go, don't go
I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?

I even love it when you're mad and so frustrated
Even though you made my simple life so complicated
Don't go, nah don't go
I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?

Sunshine, shining down
Gonna take a little walk around the woods
Don't care what we do, as long as I'm with you
Every lil' thing gonna be alright

I can't get enough
I wanna eat ya up
I'm wanna have you for dinner
Leftover for lunch
Don't go, nah don't go
I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?

Ohh, I done you wrong
But you done me back
Taught me a lesson
I can't forget that
Don't go, don't go
I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?

Ohhh, look whatcha did



Thought my life
would be right
Took her bowling
got her high
Got myself a showgirl bride
Took a job on the side
In a health shop
keeps me well
Got my mantra for life
Got my karma
And a showgirl bride
All my life
All her life
All our life
I married a showgirl
That's for life
She can't work
in the wintertime
I can't work anytime now
Go to libraries all the while
Looking for a notice
Looking for a name
All my life
All her life
All our life
I married a showgirl
That's for life
I took a showgirl
For my bride
Sprinkled stardust
on my wife
Took her bowling
got her high
Got myself a showgirl bride
Don't you recognize us?



I'm a dick I'm a dick
And I could care less

You lied to me now
I can hear you say
You're a dick you're a dick
And I could care less

You have nerve
And when you tell everybody
Lies about me and I see
You so well
You're a fake and you know it
I won't stick around you here

You're a freak
I really thought you were different
I won't be around you here
Times a wasting
Anybody can see
I'm better off without you here




To watch the news on TV
I saw some ordinary slaughter
I saw some routine atrocity
My father said, don't look away
You got to be strong, you got to be bold, now
He said, that in the end it is beauty
That is going to save the world, now

And she moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
And she moves among the flowers
And she moves something deep inside of me

I was walking around the flower show like a leper
Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria
I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair
Up against the pink and purple wisteria
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me
With some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak, I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts
That were not in my best interests to mention

And she moves among the flowers
And she floats upon the smoke
And she moves among the shadows
And she moves me with just one little look

You took me back to your place
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit
You played the patriot, you raised the flag
And I stood at full salute
Later on, we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb
And made it impossible to speak
As you closed in, in slow motion
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek

She moves among the shadows
She floats upon the breeze
She moves among the candles
And we moved through the days
And through the years

Years passed by, we were walking by the sea
Half delirious
You smiled at me and said, Babe
I think this thing is getting kind of serious
You pointed at something and said
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
It was then that I broke down
It was then that you lifted me up again

And she moves among the sparrows
And she walks across the sea
And she moves among the flowers
And she moves something deep inside of me

She moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
And she moves right up close to me



Your sleepy voice calls
Every one of my shortages 
Of good days
Transporting
Time it's so ample
And it's passing so sweet
You bring the deepest things out of me
Outside
As amazing space
Transporting
Me to you



Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, one-two-five
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man

Hey, white boy, what you doing uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasing our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just looking for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
PR shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man

Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody-body's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Aw, then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man

Baby don't you holler, darling don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time
I'm waiting for my man
Walk me home



I know you want to get pressed to me
So don't be such a stone
When I call you on the phone
Or I won't be using that number again

Maybe what you had was broke
You want to get high and they don't
So I had a drink
'Cause it helped me think
Now you say I've been drinking too much

But my hands start shaking
And my heart starts quaking
Like a nightmare naked in school
And I want to tell you


Wait a minute sister
I know I ain't your mister yet
Just give me a chance and see
But you won't even get next to me

What you want to do now
You're gonna have to give somehow
And I've got that thing you need
But you won't even get next to me

Once I get you in my grip
Follow my eyes to your hips
Don't you pull away
You've done it every day
Just stay
Why don't you stay
Why don't you stay baby
Put away your old disguise
You don't want no other guys
We're having so much fun
I know you shouldn't run
But you run, you just run
You just run baby



Me here
Heart in hand
Offering
What I can
Patience
Running thin
Come on girl
Let me in





down in the snow 
you gotta tie your scarf around my pole 
to let them know 
and I gotta take your arms around my waist 
and you'll take mine 
we gotta move our fingers and our toes 
and we'll be fine 
you're just a poor little city boy you don't know 
what you're missing 
I say welcome to the mountains 
and you're just a skinny little city girl 
you don't even know who you're kissing 
I say welcome to the mountains 
hang on hang on you better put some wool on 
we'll see the pinetreetops from high above 
move on walk up to the mountains 
and if we're lucky we'll come back alive 
I gotta take your arms around my waist 
and you'll take mine 
we gotta move our fingers 
and our toes and we'll be fine 
you're just a poor little city boy you don't know 
what you're missing 
I say welcome to the mountains 
and you're just a skinny little city girl 
you don't even know who you're kissing 
I say welcome to the mountains 
and if you wanna get high 
close to the sky 
welcome to the mountains



Wounded by the same ole shots you take
It's easier to kick me when I'm low

And I just thought that you should know
I've been holding on while you've been letting go
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time
'Cause I know I said I'm sorry but that's not what I meant to say

I'm strong enough to say
That I don't wanna take the high road now
This is so typical of you to walk away
When your perfect little world is burning down

And I just thought that you should know
I've been holding on while you've been letting go, can I be so bold?
'Cause all this sucking up to you is just getting old
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time
'Cause I know I said I'm sorry but that's not what I meant to say

What I really meant to say with every little breath I take
I'm not the only one who makes mistakes
Just think of all the ones you've made

And I just thought that you should know
I've been holding on while you've been letting go, can I be so bold?
'Cause all this sucking up to you is just getting old
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time
'Cause I know I said I'm sorry but that's not what I meant to say



i'm so sick of you

i don't know what you've been on
but when i talk with you
the same old thing goes on and on
and when I look at you

i'm so sick of you
i'm so sick of you

can't you you I don't think so
you don't know anything
on and on your mouth can go
now and I don't feel so blue ? whoa! 

on and on and on and on
on and on and on and on
on and on and on and on
on and on and on and on
whoa!

i'm so sick of you
i'm so sick of you

i don't know what you've been on
but when i talk with you
the same old thing goes on and on
and when I look at you
sick of you
sick of you
sick of you
so sick of you



The one that glows she knows
She rules the world
Free that girl
The one that glows she knows
She rules the world

She said
Call me sister rose
I'm at war with all these posers
And these frauds
I want 'em out
Let freedom reign
Let hope stand firm on fields uf doubt
Then she led me by the hand
And took me to the promised land

Free that girl
The one that glows she knows
She rules the world

She said I'm just like a rose
I'm beautiful and I can hurt you
With my thorns
Don't squeeze too tight
'Cos I can blow up in ya face like dynamite

She said
Call me sister rose
I'm at war with all these posers
And these frauds
I want 'em out
Let freedom reign
Let hope stand firm on fields uf doubt
She said take me by the hand as
I can lead you to the promised land

She said I'm just like a rose
I'm beautiful and I can hurt you
With my thorns
Don't squeeze too tight
'Cos I can blow up in ya face like dynamite

'Cos I can blow up in ya face like dynamite



I love you
All I want to do is to be you…

I love your face
I love your space
I love your rays baby
And if you like
I'll stay tonight

I could swear that I saw it up in the sky
On the eve but I never knew they could fly
It was green as an emerald in the blue
Now I'm wondering if it was really you



Right before they're happening
Hail Mary, full of grace
Some nights she swears she feels her face

And she's known a couple of boys that died
And two of them were crucified
And the last one had enlightened eyes
The first guy he was Jesus Christ

Hey Judas
I know you've made a grave mistake
Hey Peter
You've been pretty sweet since Easter break

Now she's 4am and she's wide awake
And she's shivering and smiling

Let's clutch and kiss and sing and shake
Tonight let's try to levitate
You Catholic girls start much too late
Baby, let's transverberate
Baby, let's transverberate
Baby, let's transverberate

She saw all the footage right before it got cut
And she saw all the bodies and she saw all the blood
She saw the angel put a sword in his side
And baby, that's how we got canonised

She saw him gushing blood right before he got cut
She saw them put a body in a bag in the trunk
She saw the guys coming in from the sides
And baby, that's how we get energized

She said, 
She said, 

She saw the film right before it came out
At first she thought Judas might go for the mouth
And she saw the nails and she saw the hands
She saw the crowd, she heard the band

The new kid begged them not to do it
And Jesus just said, 
Since you've been up in Massachusetts
I keep dreaming about dos cruces
And I've been thinking about both crosses
And I've been dreaming about dos cruces
Yeah, I've been thinking about both crosses



Let go, we will
Be here, be now
Slow down, be still
Breathe in, refill
Be here, be now

If you choose to love
To know that the call
Is to give all you are
To give love away, away
Rise, rise, people of love rise
People of love rise, give yourself away
Rise, rise, people of love rise
People of love rise, give yourself away
Give yourself away, give yourself away

Slow down, just breathe
Be still, believe
Be here, be now
Slow down and see
It’s all you need
Be loved and free

And to hear the call, is to give your love away
And to hear the call, is to give your love away
And to hear the call, is to give your life away
Is to give your life away

We’re not safe, we’re not safe
But we will rise



Undercover wasting time
Then one day in summer
I changed my number
To cut my line

Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know I'll be okay
Good love is on the way

Three years broken hearted
But now her ghost is finally gone
Done with broken people
This is me I'm working on

Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know I'll be okay
Good love is on the way

Good to go for wherever I'm needed
Bags are packed and I'm down by the door
You can take all the tricks up my sleeve
I don't need them anymore

Good to go for wherever I'm needed
Bags are packed and I'm down by the door
You can take all the tricks up my sleeve
I don't need them anymore

Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know I'll be okay
Good love is on the way

Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know I'll be okay
Good love is on the way



Think it true blown from the stereo,
I noticed yours, is big enough for two, yeah,
This scene won't, so I'll tell it to,
I'm gonna let her down,
Let her once again,
Ohh right,
You can tell me it, and who you are,
So don't tell me, you know all those,
I noticed yours, is big enough for two,
So won't you listen what I'm tellin' you,
I want to her down,
I need her once again,
Just want to let it down,
I need it one more time,
Ooooooo hoo hoo
One more time...
One more time...
I can see it clear, there's something going on,
Think it true blown from the stereo,
And I noticed yours, is big enough for two, yeah,
It's no different from me and you
I want to her down,
I need her once again,
I want to her down,
I need it one more time,
Ooooooo hooo,
Alright



For a very long time
Somewhere I lost myself
Its so hard to find my way back home

My body's roaming all alone

Feels like a real bad dream
I try so hard to break free
And even though I try
Something else has got a hold on me

Will I ever be in control of me?

When will I wake up
Escape from this crazy dream
Maybe tomorrow
I'll find a better dream for me

The shiver in my soul
Whoa I think I'm gonna go
But in the depth of my mind
There's a place that only I have seen

Will it ever be reality?

When will I wake up
Escape from this crazy dream
Maybe tomorrow
I'll find a better dream for me

And no matter how hard I try
Well I just can't seem to open up my eyes

Cuando Voy a despertar
Salirme de este sueno mal
Tal ve manana
Hallar un sueno mejor

When will I wake up
Escape from this crazy dream
Maybe tomorrow
I'll find a better dream for me



And sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be your Valentino just for you

Ooh, love
Ooh, lover boy
What ya doin' tonight? Hey boy
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy

Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat
Grow faster, faster
Ooh Can you feel my love heat?
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me, how do you feel right after all?
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

Ooh, love
Ooh, lover boy
What ya doin' tonight? Hey boy
Write me a letter, feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone

When I'm not with you
Think of you always I miss you
I miss those long hot summer nights
When I'm not with you
Think of me always, love you, love you
Hey boy where did you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion
In the good old-fashioned school of lover boys

Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine
Come on and get it
Ooh, love
There it goes again
Ooh, lover boy
There he goes again just like a good old-fashioned lover boy
What you did tonight? Hey boy
Ev'rything's all right just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old fashioned fashioned lover boy



There's a sadness in my heart, many thoughts to think
A letter to be written, things should be said
I stare out my window, and it starts to rain

Now how should I put this for you to see
Never wanted to hurt you, just believe in me
But I was misleaded, burned my fingers in fire
Now you feel mistreated, now I feel like a liar

We used to love each other forever more
You think we should still bother or let it go
See I'm a hard luck woman and you're not a lucky star
Though we messed it up now, let's get back to the start

You enjoy your freedom, or so they say
But your eyes aren't shining like yesterday
Now the odds are against me, I just wanna try
The flame's still burning deep inside

You used to call me baby, not anymore
Now you call me a cheater, I know the score
Yes I'm a hard luck woman, but you're not a stone cold man
I'm not quitting on this while I still can
I know I'm your woman, you know you're my man

Everyone has a dream, every play has a scene
Every night, every day is a lifetime
Every joyce, every voice tears apart my heart
All the days of my life I've waited
And the hope never has really faded

We used to love each other, we know we do
So maybe we should bother and stop playing a fool
I'll be your hard luck woman, would you be my hard luck man
The flame's still burning, just take my hand
I know I'm your woman, you know you're my man



In your books or on your desk
or did you tell your friends
That I was someone special
Did you ever lie awake the entire night
Glowing in the dark with no sheets or light
Thinking that I was someone special
You got me running
running late at night
trying to find you
And I started thinking
thinking all the time
But what could I do

I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery

Did you change your clothes did you hesitate
walking back and forth, always being late
Cause I was someone special
Did you ever take a shower did you wash your face
making up the bed thinking just incase
That I was someone special
You got me running
running late at night
trying to find you
And I started thinking
thinking all the time
But what could I do

I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery

You got me running
running late at night
trying to find you
And I started thinking
thinking all the time
But what could I do

I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery
I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery

Something special



After staying awake all night
I saw that man standing by the sea
I'm coming back here anyway, uh huh

Well, I want to get good
But I've been doing it wrong
I do what I do, but I don't understand it
I see and I hear but I don't know what you demand
Help me

A gentle wake can save a life
You looked away and opened my eyes
But I remember every word I spoke
It still cuts like a sharpened knife, uh huh

Well, I want to get good
But I've been doing it wrong
I do what I do, but I don't understand it
I see and I hear but I don't know what you demand
Help me

I was sold from the start
Now I'm not at all



And I had my share of broken hearts
I've been mistaken and I've really been wronged
Now it's tearing me apart

I've got a heart so full of love
It's gonna blow you away
Tried to resist it but you'll take it anyway
And I know it'll blow you away

I got this thing, it's a thing about you
And how you're driving me insane, yeah
Don't wanna cry but what else can I do
Guess I'll just drink it in the pain

I've got a heart so full of love
It's gonna blow you away
Tried to resist it but you take it anyway
And I know it'll blow you away

If you could look inside my soul
Then you could see the love I hold
I'm not the kind of guy who says this everyday
I just want to blow you away, alright now

I've got a heart so full of love
It's gonna blow you away
Tried to resist it but you'll take it anyway
And I know it'll blow you away
Yeah, I just want to blow you away
Oh, I just want to blow you away



She's my fantasy 
An image burnin' in my mind 
Callin' out to me 

While my imagination's runnin' wild 
Yeah - things are getting clearer 

Oh, this time everything is all right 
No way she's gonna get away 
This time everything is easy 
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine 

I've thought of every word I'd say 
Give or take a few 
But she turns and slowly walks away 
What do I have to do 

Hey - turn up your radio 
Oh - there's somethin' I want you to know 

Yeah, this time everything is all right 
No way she's gonna get away 
This time everything is easy 
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine 
Yeah, I'm gonna make her mine
This time

It's hard to take cause she's miles away 
And I've waited a long time 
But the feelin's right and darlin' one of these nights 
Yeah - I'm gonna let you know 

Oh, this time everything is all right 
No way she's gonna get away 
This time everything is easy 
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine 

This time everything is all right 
No way she's gonna get away 
This time everything is easy 
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine 
Yeah, I'm gonna make her mine
Oh yeah, this time



And the tall green grass
And I don't understand 
How all this has come to pass
How we've come to surround ourselves 
In a sea of thieves
In a land without learning 
Only the fools believe

I went driving last night 
On a dark canyon road
Had the sky to myself 
But I wasn't alone
Had the pain of my lifetime 
For my company
How did it end up like this 
For you and me

When love breaks the promise 
The heart has to keep
It leaves only truth here to find
When the spirit is crushed 
And the hurt is so deep
Between you and I

Even when love has come and gone 
And our hearts have moved along
I will remember
There was a time we had the trust
And that always was enough
I will remember
I will remember you

As I open my eyes to one more day
The wind burns my face 
As it whispers your name
As it's pulling me forward 
It tears me free
And the only thing left 
Is the tears for you and me

'Cause when love breaks the promise
The heart has to keep
It leaves only truth here to find
When the spirit is crushed 
And hurt is so deep 
Between you and I

Even when love has come and gone
And our hearts have moved along
I will remember
There was a time we had the trust 
And that always was enough
I will remember

Even when love has come and gone
And our hearts have moved along
I will remember
There was a time we had the trust 
And that always was enough
I will remember
I will remember you



Hanging out, just you and me 
I was your girl, you were man
How'd we end up like this, dont understand
Somethings change and its me 
And you know im truely sorry 
Cried out for help, you didnt listen 
Wasn't my intention, to it i was driven

Stole his heart and now 
I can see it in his eyes
Im killing him inside 
I was driving recklessly 
Now our relationship is weak
And its all because of me

I feel like a criminal on the run
I want you to catch me now 
Before this comes crahsing down 
I feel like a criminal 
Bail me out
Back to just me and you 
Can you forgive the truth ?
Criminal criminal 
Criminal criminal 

I look around what am i doing 
All the wrong things i be pursing 
I just broke down looked in your eyes
I saw your face made me realize 
All the thing ive been dealing with
Pushed me out rite to the edge 
Im bout to fall jump into nothin
But it stopped me when i see u come running

Stole his heart and now 
I can see it in his eyes
Im killing him inside 

I was driving recklessly 
Now our relationship is weak
And its all because of me

I feel like a criminal on the run
I want you to catch me now 
Before this comes crahsing down 
I feel like a criminal 
Bail me out
Back to just me and you 
Can you forgive the truth ?
Criminal criminal 
Criminal criminal 

And i dont know were i stand 
Do i still fit in your plans 
Cause i fled the scene for way too long 
And i dont know if you see
Forever you and me 
For that its worth im still holding on 

Driving recklessly 
Now our relationship is week
And its all because of me

I feel like a criminal on the run
I want you to catch me now 
Before this comes crahsing down 
I feel like a criminal 
Bail me out
Back to just me and you 
Can you forgive the truth ?
Criminal criminal

Don't let those dying ships sail away.
Promise me you'll never say die.

Whispers in the wind carry messages to lovers far.
Tales of lost romance and of that missed chance and fleeting hearts.

Yesterday, befriends anger with words you say.
Don't let those dying ships sail away.
Promise me you'll never say die.

Ashes in the sand bury witnesses to broken hearts.
Scars of lone memories and of those crushed dreams and open arms.

Yesterday, befriends anger with words you say.
Don't let those dying ships sail away.
Promise me you'll never say die.

You'll never say die... you'll never say die...

Love songs and tidal waves have washed me away.
Love songs and tidal waves have washed me away...

Yesterday, befriends anger with words you say.
Don't let those dying ships sail away.
Promise me you'll never say die.



That's a really nice suit, this is a really comfortable chair
See, I don't know if you can help me or not
'Cause I don't feel sick, I don't feel sick

But the pains in my head have almost put me underground

I don't really care if I am healthy or not
Just clean my head up, doc, I'll give you anything you want
See, I don't know why I don't fall in love
Well, maybe I know why, and maybe you could make it stop

We'll cut it up and bury it and leave it underground
And I'll take to wishing and fall under sleeping safe and sound

Just give me medicine, prescribe me anything
Just knock me out and walk me through the door
Well I have no desire
To see through my own eyes anymore
Any more? ha ha ha

Hello? what the hell are you doing here?
You made a really strange face, this is really uncomfortable air
I see I'm boring you, well maybe I bore myself too
That's why I need help, I'm cleaning blood off dusty shelves

I've been cut up in this room so many times it might take days
And those stress cracks in the wood, how nicely they soak up the stains

Just give me medicine, prescribe me anything
Just knock me out and walk me through the door
Well I have no desire
To see through my own eyes anymore
Any more? ha ha ha

Been telling myself these jokes for so long, well so long
I'm a has-been who is heckled on the stage
Been telling myself these jokes for so long, well so long
I'm a has-been who is heckled on this stage



I tried to erase it
I tried to race it
I can't erase it

Driving in the slow lane
Watching everybody shooting by
In the fast lane, in the fast lane
Sitting here beside me
There is a shadow from my past
In the front seat I can heart my heartbeat
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster

I tried to face it
I can't erase it
So I must face it
I must embrace it

I have wasted my time
Dwelling in the shadows from the past
In the front seat did you hear my heartbeat
Forward to the future I must move on I will let go
To the future
That's where I will soar
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

So I can face it
Then I will chase it
I will embrace it

You can't outrun your skeleton
No way, No way
You can't outrun your skeleton
No way, No way
Oh
No way, No way
Oh
No way, No way
Oh
No way, No way
Oh

In the corner of the room
I tried to face it
In the corner of the room
I must embrace it
In the corner of the room
And I will chase it
In the corner of the room
I will embrace it



And i'm down to skin and bones 
And mind can't get me now 
You catch all the signs i show 
And by now we're burning slow 
But we can't wait this out now

Hang on 
In the end we'll make things right 
In the end we'll be just fine 
Because i want out
I'd give it up to get it all 
I'd give it up to get it all
I'd give it up to take it all

By now it's the face you show 
And i feel it in my bones that we won't make it out 
You turned on all the lights you shown 
And this curse is not alone 
But we can't break it down now

Hang on 
In the end we'll be just fine 
In the end we'll make things right 
Because i want out 
I'd give it up to get it all 
I'd give it up to get it all 
I'd give it up to take it all

Hang on 
In the end we'll make things right
In the end we'll be just fine 
Because i want out 
I'd give it up to get it all
I'd give it up to get it all
I'd give it up to take it all



It's been there a while tries not to say
That you've had your day
But have a faith that looks both ways
Look in your eyes, we'll last a lifetime

So when you reach the end of the road
It still leaves somewhere to go
You don't look for signs at the end of the road
But I won't try to live side by side
And I won't try when you can take me back in time

That charmless look upon your face
Found its way through the smallest things that have changed

So when you reach the end of the road
It still leaves somewhere to go
You don't look for signs at the end of the road
But I won't try to live side by side
And I won't try when you can take me back in time
And I won't try to live side by side
And I won't try no one can take me back in time



Stop this cheating
Stop treating me like I am some
Kind of fool over whose eyes you can pull the wool
You're not so cool
Remember it's to me you are speaking

Stop cutting
Stop hurting
Stop this dirt
About you lifting up your skirt
To any man dressed in pants with shirt buttons undone and flirting

When you are so low down in Soho
There is no hope no how
No place to go
You will go along
Some people say I'm a crazy kind of fool
But be that as it may
You always treat me cruel
Solo in Soho

Stop talking
Stop eating
We can't go on meeting
And greeting
Meeting and cheating and meeting
And sleeping you know that's deceiting
And that's only repeating

When you are so low
Down in Soho
There is no hope no how
There is no place to go
But you will go along
Some people say I'm a crazy kind of fool
But be that as it may you always treat me cruel
Solo in Soho



And I'm bored with the same old lines
I never know what to do, what to say to you
One look and you'll knock me out
Put me on the floor with a 10 count
I don't wanna make a scene
I gotta make you see

That I've been waiting for  a girl like you
And I know there's nothing I can do
Don't it make you hurt
Don't it make you feel
Like the world ain't on your side
Like you're never gonna get it right
No I can't fight
I can't sleep at night
Just thinking about you girl
I'm a fool
For you
Yes I am

You been on my mind
Since I saw you walking by
I knew I had to know you better
You were everything
But I didn't know what to say
So you just walked away
I couldn't believe what a fool I was to let you go

'Cause I've been waiting for  a girl like you
And I know there's nothing I can do
Don't it make you hurt
Don't it make you feel
Like the world ain't on your side
Like you're never gonna get it right
No I can't fight
I can't sleep at night
Just thinking about you girl
I'm a fool
For you
Yes I am

When I saw you at the beach
Talking with my friends
I couldn't believe my eyes
It was my lucky day
So I just asked you out
To the forum to see No Doubt
When you said you would go
I thought I might explode

'Cause I've been waiting for  a girl like you
And I know there's nothing I can do
Don't it make you hurt
Don't it make you feel
Like the world ain't on your side
Like you're never gonna get it right
No I can't fight
I can't sleep at night
Just thinking about you girl
I'm a fool
For you

Don't it make you hurt
Don't it make you feel



Turn you around and maybe then turn you out.
I don't know how to make it real,
Whatever you want it's no big deal. I've changed my tone.

I gotta disappear.
Don't wanna hear that sound on the radio.
Yeah, we could all hum along; cause it's the same old song.

I don't know how to make it stop.
Go left of the dial to really rock, but I'm not sure.
Yeah, I could get over anyway.
It's cool but you're starting to decay. The signal fades.

I gotta disappear.
Don't wanna hear that sound on the radio.
Yeah, we could all hum along; cause it's the same old song.

You could watch me come undone.
You could watch me come undone.
Yeah you, you could watch me come undone.
Two, Three, Go
You can hum along. You can hum along.
You can hum along. You can hum along.

I wanna turn you on again.
Turn you around and maybe then.

I gotta disappear.
Don't wanna hear that sound on the radio.
Yeah, we could all hum along; cause it's the same old song.

I gotta disappear.
Don't wanna hear that sound on the radio.
Yeah, we could all hum along; yeah we could hum along, yeah.



In December I left in my wake crests and casualties
I salvaged scraps, harvested corners, my stride unsure
I had to watch through my fingers through the camera
Unstable, my footing
My stride unsure anyway
With embers I hold in my lungs still smoldering
"Trust we'll defy time and the posture you define"



Where no man's gone
Launching deep into the great unknown
Space and time passing by
But the world outside
Is swallowed whole by the starless sky

I turned the key in the door
It's been a long time a-coming
I've been a long time gone

I can't believe this is happening to me
We have passed the sun
And something tells me this has just begun

I turned the key in the door
It's been a long time a-coming
I've been a long time gone

All the forces of the cosmos lead me on
As we shoot through the galaxy
I'm coming home!



Learn to bend
We are better butterflies
All meek we get the end

It makes me sick
It makes me laugh when I shouldn't
Kill what I came to keep alive
Your turn to spill
Your turn to spill
Your turn to spill, now

That's fate looking our way
Your sparkling spot hasn't caught on
That's fate stealing away
Your sparkling spot hasn't caught on
Hasn't caught on

The day we met up it's hard to get up
And live it down
We are smaller maybe
Than what we can't get around

It makes me sick
It makes me laugh when I look at you
Clap while it's kicking us around
And what it spills
And what it spills
And what it spills is

Fate, looking our way
Your sparkling spot hasn't caught on
That's fate stealing away
Your sparkling spot hasn't caught on
Hasn't caught on
Hasn't caught on
Hasn't caught on



He says he's got your medication
She was sitting on the edges of his vision
Trying to start a revolution

But he's done with all the parties, he's covered in contusions
Your laugh leaves laugh lines, your love leaves bright bruises
She said she was cruising but she came back all proud and out of focus
With a cool car crankin' Krokus

Guys go for looks, girls go for status
There are so many nights when this is just how it happens
Guys go for looks, girls go for status

He was dreadlocked in the dorms in the Colorado corn
He says he's got your vegetation
She was sitting on the edge of the bed smoking
Trying to reach emancipation

And he's done with DVDs, he's fully entertained
He's bleaching out the blood stains, he's got diamonds in the drain
She said that she was coming but she mostly just made hard fast noises
It kind of sounded like The Locust

Guys go for looks, girls go for status
There are so many nights when this is just how it happens
Guys go for looks, girls go for status

It was song number three on John's last CD,
"I'm going to make it through this year
If it kills me."
And it almost killed me

And song number four on that first D4
You want the scars but you don't want the war
That's just hardcore
These kids are clever to the core

Guys go for looks, girls go for status
Guys go for looks, girls go for status
Guys go for looks, girls go for status



Shine a light in what you say
Every time you look my way
You talk around going purple haze

Close your eyes and pretend
You're not at all a black friend

Smile this girl on the strip
You really learn just how to be hip
Tell your stories 'bout your crazy trip
Messing with stars and doing tricks

Close your eyes and pretend
It started all back then

Big glass house on the hill
Doing dope but did you swear
Yesterday was buried last year
Well I don't care I thought was clear

Close your eyes and pretend
This is how it should end

Cinderella of the mind
Doesn't know her left from right
She so hungry for a bite
Forget your friends for midnight

Don't you know who's keeping score
Who's that barking at your door

Hold tight with fear living
Hold tight with fear living
Hold tight with fear living
Hold tight with fear

That was then
This is now

Hold tight with fear living
Hold tight with fear living
Hold tight with fear living
Hold tight with fear

That was then
This is now

Every time you look my way
Remember a girl who used to say
Hold me tight every way
It's okay, it's only play

I will learn you in my dawn
Where I came from for I run



Away from myself
Outside feels like it's calling
Calling



Oh mama please dont go, yeah
Cause the way I love you
Child you'll never know
Oh come back baby, yeah yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh now now
Well I admit, baby
That I was wrong
Don't you know, baby
Child you been gone too long
Oh come back baby, yeah yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh now now
Say If I could holler
Like a mountain jack
Yeah yeah oh people
I'd call my baby back
Oh come back baby, Woo yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh now now
Now one of these days, baby
And It won't be long, yeah
You gonna look for me child you know
And I'll be gone
So come back baby, yeah yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh now now



To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like, to be hated
To be fated, to telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

No one knows what it's like, to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you you, you, you
No one bites back as hard, on their anger
None of my pain and woe, can show through through, through, through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

Discover, L.I.M.P. say it 
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover

No one knows what it's like, to be mistreated
To be defeated, behind blue eyes blue eyes, blue eyes, blue eyes
And no one knows how to say, that they're sorry
And don't worry, I'm not telling lies lies, lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes



I was simple, but now I know 

Nobody wants to be the weak one
We all want to go from strength to strength 

You made me hard, you made me strong
I was simple but not for long 

Nobody wants to be the weak one
We all want to go from strength to strength
If I could go back in time, well I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change a thing 

I brought to you a kind disposition
You led me on and you rejected me
It took a while but I've accepted
I learnt a slow and painful lesson 

You made me hard, you made me strong
I was simple but not for long 

I wonder what you find so attractive
I've never seen you looking this excited
So let's just leave it at one third each
'Cause we both want something so far out of reach 

You made me hard, you made me cold
I was simple but now I know
Now I know

seems the story of our lives
was i right about how we should be living
must be looking through someone else's eyes

i don't care
what you say
fuck the words 
that get in our way

bring us rain
can't make it pour
bring us life
can't make us live
bring it all
don't have to take
i will not accept your blame

forsake my freedom to give you your voice
how could you never learn to speak
take these moments and make them what they're worth
you can't keep living through me

i don't care
what you think
fuck the air
that makes us breathe

bring us rain
can't make it pour
bring us life
can't make us live
bring it all
don't have to take
i will not accept your blame



Did you bite off more than you can chew?
Are you sad cause the grass is always greener?
Well, babe, you look much better in red and blue.

Everything will be okay
Just give it just a minute longer-
Cause a brighter star is on the way.
Everything will be okay
Remember when the rain is falling-
It's alright.

So fear itself is the only thing we have to fear?
But - fear can be so much fun with a friend or two.
And don't you be so afraid to meet your Maker-
Cause I hear that She's just as scared of you.

Everything will be okay
Just give it just a minute longer-
Cause a brighter star is on the way.
Everything will be okay
Remember when the rain is falling-
It's alright to go outside and play.



With clowns and a crowd
With no hopes at all
A blanket of snow falls outside
And keeps us drinking inside
Clear skies means clear brains
And elephant sized malaise

Oh you shoplifter 
Why did you take her
From me

You've got motion inside
You're wild in your stride
Your stride drives her wild
Tell me the story of your
Fame and misfortune
Your cloud of distortion

I've been drained of that feeling
We've been driving all night
You ran off with my feelings
Don't you know



And I'm reaching for a lie
Open my eyes, I am broken
I've been hiding from myself
Too scared of what I'd find
Tell me, who can help me fix this mess of mine?

I've always played the game to win
Huh, now I'm sitting here wondering
How did I get to this point on my knees
Looking skyward asking God
Couldn't you have done anything?

I don't wanna live in bitterness
So God send me an angel
I need something miraculous
To pick me up where I fell

And Oh, I'm searching for the truth
And I'm reaching for a lie
Open my eyes, I am broken
Oh, I've been hiding from myself
Too scared of what I'd find
Tell me, who can help me fix this mess of mine?

Yeah!

Tell me how long will it take
To stop reliving it in my head
Oh I wish it would end
Why do these memories plague my mind?
I'm haunted by it all the time
Will I ever escape?

And I don't wanna live for yesterday
So God send me an angel
To come and take this pain away
Pick me up where I fell

Oh, I'm searching for the truth
I'm reaching for a lie
Open my eyes and I am broken
Oh, I've been hiding from myself
Too scared of what I'd find
Tell me, who can help me fix this mess of mine?

Take me away
From this mess I've made, all my mistakes
I want to escape
Take me away

Take me away
From this mess I've made, all my mistakes
I want to escape

But, no!

I'm searching for the truth
I'm reaching for a lie
Open my eyes and I am broken
Oh, I've been hiding from myself
Too scared of what I'd find
Tell me, who can help me fix this mess of mine?

Whoah!



When we said goodbye for the very last time
There was still so much to say
But time came between us and quietly stole you away

Let me remember the day
We walk to the garden and sit for a while
The hours are slipping away
Still I try to hold them and freeze them in time
So leave me believing we'll meet here again
Promise me some kind of sign

As each day turns into night
I blow out the candle and turn down the sheet
And now that you've risen so high
I know that you watch over me as i sleep
Always believing we'll meet up again
Waiting for some kind of sign

So now I remember the day
When we said goodbye for the very last time
But no one can take you away
'Cause here in my memories 
There's never a very last time
Never a very last time.



I've heard it far too many times.
We play these stupid games from a million miles away.
But I don't care.
As long as I can hold you when I'm there.
It's one a.m. back home.
I call you on the phone.
Just two shadows in the sky.
Just for tonight.
You speak to me in rhymes,
reminding me of all the times the wrong words say upon my tongue unspoken.
It's two a.m. back home.
I can't do this on my own.
Just two shadows in the sky.
Stay for a while, cause we might be onto something, baby.
As I say goodbye, I can see myself in the reflection in your eyes.
Don't say you're sorry.
I've heard it far too many times.
Another summer night.
We drive until it's light.
Add another to the list of plans I have to make you mine.
It's three a.m. back home.
We're finally alone.
Just two shadows in the sky.
Stay for a while baby, I'll savor you.



Everyone a seed
Half of us are satisfied
Half of us in need

Love’s bountiful in us
Tarnished by our greed
Oh, when will there be

Come home with the least

And nation after nation
Turnin’ into beasts

A harvest for the world?

Yeah, hey
When will there be
I wanna know now, now

When will there be a harvest Harvest for the world
When will there be a harvest Harvest for the world

When will there be a harvest Harvest for the world
When will there be Harvest for the world
When will there be Harvest for the world

Everybody Harvest for the world
Oh, talkin’ bout the children Harvest for the world
When will there be a harvest Harvest for the world
When will there be Harvest for the world



in your best friend's car
knocked on my door about five thirty
nursing a broken heart
still got your keys in your back pocket - still got your jacket on
back door's open baby - i don't lock it
we can leave anytime we want

i got my motor runnin' - fingers drummin'
i never planned to stay
getaway - ya know it's now or never
getaway - nobody lives forever
we're only waitin' just to make our getaway

hey baby we were good together
seemed like you'd always be my girl
but looking back now we were just too clever
thinking love could change the world
ya know there's no point in waitin' - hesitating
we gotta leave today...



It seems like every second
Is like a door that opens
To allow in
What has not yet happened

I'm not the sanguine type,
Related to the blood
I think my head will fall off
If I don't stop it
From Turning around

I'm like a cat on a wire
Balacing so carelessly
Unafraid and in expectancy
Of something good
And never seen

I won't be so pleased
The next day
Right now I can't
Get enough
She's like a broken flower
Never ever in love

I gotta go
I got a better view on
The other side of town

Get it over with
All that's good and bad
That's all gone
I know it's hard to get
But these things
You better just don't know

A water vapour curtain
I ain't looking at the time
She hit me with an arrow
Right trough my spine

It's about time for farewell
So easy to be
She's like a broken flower
She's just like me

I gotta go
I got a better view on
The other side of town

Get it over with
All that's good and bad
That's all gone
I know it's hard to get
But these things
You better just don't know

It's gonna be
Seven seconds of silence
When I'm home
You shouldn't
Ask me anything
That you don't
Wanna know



somethimes I feel as though I did
I don't have answers for every single question
But that's OK 'cos I'm just a kid

Well I've seen pictures of my mother
When she looked exactly like me
And I've seen all my friends running for cover
Running from something they can't see

And it's not easy to get a handle on my life
but I have tried it time and time again

But I still cry just like a baby
And I answer back to feel a little free
And I still fly even though I'm gonna fall
But I'm too far gone to let it get to me

I'm not much like my generation
Their music only hurts my ears
And I don't hide my pain to save my reputation
It's too hard to keep up with these years

And it's not easy to make a habit disappear
But I have tried it time and time again

But I still cry just like a baby
And I answer back to feel a little free
And I still fly even though I'm gonna fall
But I'm too far gone to let it get to me

I won't let it get to me.



Well, they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin
When I say that I'm okay, well, they look at me kind of strange
Surely you're not happy, now you no longer play the game

People say I'm lazy dreaming my life away
Well, they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me
When I tell them that I'm doing fine, watching shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time, boy? You're no longer on the ball

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go 'round and 'round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

People asking questions lost in confusion
Well I tell them there's no problems, only solutions
Well they shake their heads and they look at me as if I've lost my mind
I tell them there's no hurry now, I'm just sitting here doing time

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go 'round and 'round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go



Unclear, but I see just what I'm afraid of
I can't find my way anymore
And I cannot heal the wounds I've created
And I can't let go of what's killing me

Falling from this edge
I am lost to all I know and

I can't breathe anymore
Somehow I'm locked inside this cage
And I've tried but I can't fight to stay alive

Falling from this edge
I am lost to all I know
Time is only fantasy
And lies, the only reverie

I've tried
But I can't fight
Anymore

Falling from this edge
I am lost to all I know
Time is only fantasy
And lies, the only reverie



With a coke and a smile
Only You make me happy
If that was the real thing
Then I'm in denial
Only You make me happy
Now my heart's on my sleeve
Don't care if I'm not in style
Only You make me happy

Superficial
Fake
And fleeting
Fashion statements have no meaning

Only You make me happy
Only You make me happy
Everything will change
But You remain the same
Only You make me happy

I had it under control
I had it right where it wants me
Only You make me happy
I've got the rock and the roll
It made me one of the posse
Only You make me happy

Fame and fortune
Blind ambition
Can't replace
The love You've given

Like a song in my head
It lives and it dies
Only You make me happy
Elvis is dead
But my King is alive
Only You make me happy

Only You make me happy
Only You make me happy
Everything can go
'Cause the one thing I know
Is only You make me happy



I'll now ignite the mission, yeah to fall in love, not fall in line.
Still, something real was missing to mix with heat and light 
A brand new fuel giving purpose to the ups and downs and wrongs and rights.

When all the flames came rushing it was so beautiful.
Still, I wanted something more to say as I spread this blaze
So I left that fire, and started a new one. and then another one.

So do you think to give up could be better, or have you even tried?
The fire you have warmed up to is only gonna burn you up inside.

When all the flames came rushing it was oh so beautiful.
But I wanted something more to say when I spread this blaze.
So I left that fire, and started a new one. I started a new one.

Soak the ground with gasoline, 
Drop the match and let the blaze infect us all.

Seeing this fire burning out of control, 
I finally feel the warmth of the Everglow.
Take a dream, light it up and watch it grow.
A combustible explosion explode

Before you say that a part of you has died, 
Remember that the fire is on the inside.
All you need is to open up wide. 
Time for action, chain reaction it's time

I see the truth rising up in flames
Oh it burns away at the remains, 
And it's strong enough to overtake the rain
Bright enough to see the light of day.

When all the flames came rushing, well you know it was beautiful.
But you've still got something more to say 
For this world today I know that we could change
So let's make a pact, to never hold it back.
Won't you take that fire with you and then start a new one?
Go ahead and then start a new one
Yeah!
We've started a new one.



Waiting for the world's applause
Rebel without a conscience
Martyr without a cause

Static on your frequency
Electrical storm in your veins
Raging an unreachable glory
Straining at invisible chains

And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
Staring down into a heartless sea
Can't face life on a razor's edge
Nothing's what you thought it would be

All of us get lost in the darkness
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars
All of us do time in the gutter
Dreamers turn to look at the cars

Turn around and turn around and turn around
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Don't turn your back and slam the door on me

It's not as if this barricade
Blocks the only road
It's not as if you're all alone
In wanting to explode

Someone set a bad example
Made surrender seem all right
The act of a noble warrior
Who lost the will to fight

And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
Staring down into a heartless sea
Done with life on a razor's edge
Nothing's what you thought it would be

All of us get lost in the darkness
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars
All of us do time in the gutter
Dreamers turn to look at the cars

Turn around and turn around and turn around
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Don't turn your back and slam the door on me

No hero in your tragedy 
No daring in your escape
No salutes for your surrender
Nothing noble in your fate
Christ, what have you done?

All of us get lost in the darkness
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars
All of us do time in the gutter
Dreamers turn to look at the cars

Turn around and turn around and turn around
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Don't turn your back and slam the door on me



She comes and look now how you are the fireside
I'm watching, she's waiting to show you the pearls in her Betsy Clark eyes
She sighs the whistling winds you sail in
She cries and you are alive
She's saying she's sorry and oh,
So am I
So am I
For ninety seven days that should have been an hour

I know it's all you can do when she's so very near
Praise be the King of the settee and his Guinevere
I'll get up and go out and no doubt
You're giving it all to her, oh

So am I
So am I
The ninety-seven days the fifteen blessed hours
And it's easy as it goes, so am I
How and hour of ninety days will soon run out of time

The weight of the world has the head in your hands
She's Indian giving again
You're sorry and sick and you know

So am I
So am I
The ninety seven days and fifteen sodding hours came to nothing
Taken in?
So was I
She's going, going gone and you know that's fine

And so am I



Out trying to think why it stinks, he's not a girl
Now he's kicked in the gut, they fucked him up, just enough

Androgynous mind, androgynous mind

Of forever... ever...
Falling... falling...star...star...

this is what you made it
i'm stepping from this trip
no more do i need it
sharks and there's fishes in the sea
i don't want no other fish
there's only one for me yeh
love is here no
love is here
love is
love is here no
love is here
dearly beloved
we're gathered here today
don't pay no notice
to what i have to say
laying in the bed of roses
torn apart by thorns
watching angel's halo's
love is here no
love is here
love is
love is here no
love is here
original
well if all dat ah want you want
denner dat you ago get
you no experience dis ah one yet
search no more don't bother
worry or fret
coz dis is something dat ya bound for forget
head spit in to nuff scars of war
take me out equal the score
buzzing like the trampoline
go check the grass it ain't no greener
the more you fly
the more you crawl
got my back up against the wall
harsh words are said in anger
what don't kill me make me stronger



And listen to my dream, you're bound
To thank me when I'm done
So here is one
I was there and you were too
But it wasn't exactly you
And it wasn't really even me
Don't you see

I don't expect
For you to understand completely
Even I
Don't ask why
Cause it can't be summed up neatly

Word of mouth began to fly
So when people promised to pay to publish, I
Reluctantly agreed
Cause people need

A voice for those without one, I've
Tried to keep the dream alive
Now I'm leaving it up to you
To misconstrue

And oh, have you seen
In the May or may not issue
Of some Vague magazine
Interpretations like that make you wish you
Kept shut your mouth
And your heart cause your subconscious
Should be yours
And no one else's
I shall die a thousand deaths

Oh
The dream is over
Oh
I can't believe it
That the world went on without me
Now I'm that much more behind
But I'll be all right, cause
Wide awake or sound asleep
Either way, we're all counting sheep
No, I don't dream for a living
I'm just living the dream
I'm living the dream
I'm living the dream



You crawled from the cancer to land on your feet
Are you crazy to want this
Even for a while?

We're making this shit up
The reasons for being are easy to pay
You can't remember the others
They just kind of went away

So you're driving, it's rush hour
The cars on the freeway are moving like slugs
When you drift off to wake up
Do you always hit the brakes?

And we're done lying for a living
The strange days have come and you're
You're gone, you're gone
Either dead or dying
Dead or trying to go

It's evening, you're tired
You sleepwalk, a robot, out to the street
Are you crazy to want this
Even for a while?

You're driving, it's rush hour
The cars on the freeway are moving
Backwards, into a wall of fire
Backwards, into a wall of fire
Backwards, into a wall of fire
Backwards, into a wall of fire

And we're done lying for a living
The strange days have come and you're
You're gone, you're gone
And we're done lying for the living
The strange days have come and you're
You're gone, you're gone
Either dead or dying
You're dead or trying to go
To go

Good morning, don't cop out

*From the gravestone of William Carey, reading only, "A wretched, poor, and helpless worm, On Thy kind arms I fall"



and sorrow's all around
if you think your loves all been in vain
just cry to end the pain.

Please keep the faith, we need it.

You look for a way out
of this sea of doubt.
It looks hard I understand
swimmin when you can't see land.

Please keep the faith, we need it.

You need to see the country
but something holds you back.
Travel near, far and wide.
Have no fear or nothing to hide.

Please keep the faith, we need it.
If you're tired of the human race,
and you can't find yourself in pace,
there's too many games goin round
and the Man's tryin to bring you down.

Please keep the faith, we need it.



'Cause I was beaten up and jaded by the news
And underneath the skin the truth is breaking through
So they just sewed me up and spit me out
And I can't change it
I can't change this

You you take away the world
And I don't even know myself now
So how can I know you
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try

My thoughts are floating as reality explodes
I'm whispering to each of you my friends
And every moment seems to freeze frame through the room
And all the colours are electrified
But I can't see now
I can't see now

You you take away the world
And I don't even know myself now
So how can I know you
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try


And I can't change it
I can't change this

You you take away the world
And I don't even know myself now
So how can I know you
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try
One more try yeah
Just give me one more try
One more try yeah
Just give me one more try



Red from the night before the night before 
Walked into the wrong bar walked into a door 

Old Red's in town 
And sitting late at night he doesn't make a sound 
Just adding to the wrinkles on his deathly frown 

They're only red from all the tears that I should've shed 
They're only red from all the women that I could've wed 
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realise 
They could never be blue 
They could never be blue 
They could never be blue 
They could never be blue 

Listen up Old Red 
You never listened to a word the doctor said 
He told you if you drank another you'd be dead 

Old Red Eyes is back 
His shoulders ache all over and his brain is sore 
He pours a drink and listens to his body thaw 

They're only red from all the thoughts unused inside my head 
They're only red from all the things I could have done instead 
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realise 
They could never be blue 
They could never be blue 
They could never be blue 
They could never be blue 

Blue is a street without an end 
Red is the colour of my hell 
Blue is a greeting from a friend 
Red is the colour of farewell 

Old Red he died 
And every single landlord in the district cried 
An empty bottle of whisky laying by his side 
A lazy little tear running from each eye 
They could never be blue 
They could never be blue 
They could never be blue 
They could never be blue



There ain't nothing in the bottom of your glass
For a broken heart
You were doing pretty good till she came 
And tore your world apart
She found a little younger model
You ran straight for the bottle
There ain't nothing in the bottom of your glass
For a broken heart

Do you find yourself tossin' and a turnin'
In the middle of the night
With a cigarette burning
Staying up until the broad daylight
Well you gotta be going crazy
With another man lovin' on your baby
There ain't nothing in the middle of the night
For a broken heart

There ain't never been a cure for the lowdown blues
When a woman puts on a pair of walking shoes
You ought to know by now 
There's nothing, son, that you can do
For a broken heart

Ain't nothing when the morning finally comes
Gonna change a thing
A little hair of the dog ain't gonna hurt you
Have yourself a drink
She found another lover
I sure feel for you brother
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world for a broken heart




When we heard our song, we say it
Remember...
When we shared our toys with one another
How it was, that night
They took us to the station

Remember...
The little angel staring at me
Like to still believe that you are here
Yes I know the price of fear
Tell me, please tell me
Where did you go
That long night?
Where did you go
That long night?

I thought you'd said
I thought you'd never forget
I thought you'd said
I thought you'd never forget

So now, we could, be good

Push
'Till I get it straight
Understand
I'll push
'Till I get it straight
Understand all there is to know

Say... Gabriel says

Where did you go?
Leave me to stay
I don't know
Come back soon

Where did you go?
Leave me to stay
I don't know
Come back soon

Where did you go?
Leave me to stay
I don't know
Come back soon

Where did you go?
Leave me to stay
I don't know
Come back sometime

I thought you'd said
I thought you'd never forget

Please say...

I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside, ooh ooh ooh
Meanwhile I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle, highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous

I feel so romantic, can we do it again
Can we do it again sometime
Ooh, I like that
Fantastic, c'est la vie Mesdames et Messieurs
And at the peak of the season, the Mediterranean
This time of year, it's so fashionable

Yeah yeah

I feel like dancing, in the rain
Can I have a volunteer?
Just keep right on dancing
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification, as a matter of fact
So tres charmant my dear

Underneath the moonlight wooh ooh, together we'll shine across the sea shine on silvery moonlight
Reminiscing every night
Meantime and in the meantime baby, I ask you to be my Valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial, start a sensational
Seaside rendezvous - so adorable
Seaside rendezvous - ooh ooh
Seaside rendezvous - give us a kiss



Who'd have thought it, hmm
It's kinda breath taking the way that you're still loving me
I'm ready to give you all I have, take the best of me
I am here before you
And you're the reason
That I'm living, I am yours every part of me
And wherever you are is exactly where i want to be

You smile and my pain disappears 
It seems as though my troubles fly away, hey
What we have is just the most amazing, amazing thing
You're right there by my side when i fall, to say its ok, hey

Those three words that you say
I love you
You'll never know how much it means when you say that to me 
Three words just turn all of my dreams into reality
Right here in your arms
Where i belong
I never want to live a day without you by my side
Look in your eyes and find that on you i can rely

You smile and my pain disappears 
And it seems as though my troubles fly away, yeah
What we have is just the most amazing, amazing thing

You're right there by my side when i fall, to say its ok, hey

You take my breath away
See things in me
I can't see in myself
When everything is crazy
And my world's gettin' hazy
I wouldn't turn to no one else
Yeah

You smile and my pain disappears 
It seems as though my troubles fly away, away, away
It is just the most amazing, amazing thing
You're right there by my side when i fall, to say its ok

Yeah, you smile and my pain disappears
It seems as though my troubles fly away
What we have is just the most amazing, amazing thing
You're right there by my side when i fall, to say it's ok, ok, ok

Ok, ok, ok

You smile and my pain disappears



I wanna know, I wanna know why you keep making me wait
I guess a girl can't understand what it is that a woman will give a man
And if you're not gonna love it, oh, you better move on

You know I'm getting uptight with your forgetting ways
But girl, it ain't right, it ain't right, I guess it must be a phase
When a girl can't understand what it is that a woman gives a man
And if you're not gonna love it, oh, you better move on

You got no re, no reason for thinking that you're gonna do wrong
So stop your reason, give up or you better be gone, move on

You got no reason for thinking that you're gonna do wrong
So stop your reason, give up, move on

If you wanna say bye then it's all just the same
I don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't, if it's only a game
I guess a girl can't understand what it is that a woman, she gives a man
And if you're not gonna love it, oh, you better move on
I think you better move on, better move on



Sink like a stone
Walk home alone
It’s not the first time, it’s not the worst crime
Your soul will be okay

When you’ve had enough
Searching for love
And you miss the touch
Of someone new

Burns by dreams
It’s never how it seems
Cold crushed esteem
Take shelter and hide forever
Your soul will be okay

And you’ve had enough
Searching for love
But you miss the touch
Of someone new

Ooooohh
Ooooohh

And you’ve had enough
Searching for love
But I miss the touch
Of someone new

Soaked to the bone
Sink like a stone
I will take you home
It’s not the first time, it’s not the worst crime
Our souls will be okay



It's bringin' my baby back
She been gone so long
But now the train is bringin' her home, oh


Train hurry up
Bring my baby back
Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track
Train hurry up

Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track

There's people all around

It's like a clickity-clack
My heart is keeping rhythm with the train on the track, oh


I remember the love she gave me
She remembers the love I gave her too
And here she comes and it's drivin' me crazy 'cause
We'll do all the things that we used to do . . . oh, ho

Train hurry up, bring my baby back
Train hurry up, bring my baby back

Ho!

The train is pullin' in
I'm gonna be with my girl again
The huffin' puffin' lovin' train
As she pulls into the station
Never leave me again, oh


Oh Train hurry up
Bring my baby back
Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track here she comes
Train hurry up
Bring my baby back it's bringin' her back
Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track bring her back

Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track bring her back
Train hurry up
Bring my baby back here she comes
Hallelujah look it's comin'on down the track



Shouting to the ground below
People running here, people running scared
Hiding in the shadow

Turn a blind eye, turn a deaf ear
It's all so hard to handle
All the changing minds and changing of the times
Changing the channels

I care more 'cause I know what's in store
I care more because I know the score
I can't wait!!!

A nut case in a tower polishing his holy gun
Reciting a nursery rhyme
Mama picks the kids up, gives them both a kiss
And drives them in a lake to die

People in confusion, people in despair
Solution's elemental
When all the psychological metaphysical self help
Mumbo jumbo seems so farcical

I care more 'cause I know what's in store
I care more because I know the score
I can't wait!!!
I can't wait!!!



And I can feel it in my bones, they're aching
I'll watch the sky and wait and wish these waters ease my pain
Because my well is breaking

If you'd get next to me and help me find simplicity
Then you could be the one to take me, to break me
And flood my soul

Could you be the one to release me?
Oh, release me
Waiting for your love
Oh, to free me
So, release me

Grey clouds they infiltrate
As every move you make
Gets me closer to clarity
While droplet drummers lead a complex beat increases speed
Somehow accompanies our intensities

At first this cloud burst is pulling us under
Lightning and thunder
Rain falls and you take me under
And flood my soul

Could you be the one to release me
Oh, release me
Waiting for your love
Oh, to free me
So, release me

So take of your shoes and stay awhile
This might be the right time tonight
If it makes you feel good
Then it makes me feel alright
We should take down the curtains now
And make blankets here on the floor
A torrential downpour
The potential for more
Cease to fight this tension that
Ignites us here in the dark
Cause tension causes friction
And this friction leads to spark

The rain has filled this cup
And before it overflows
I wanna take you in now
Here it goes

Could you be the one to release me
Oh, release me
Waiting for your love
Oh, to free me
So, release me

Could you be the one to release me
Oh, release me
We have just begun
You release me
So, release me



You took my past 
And threw it against your wall of fate 

You got me, got me, got me good 
You thought you had me on your hook 
Wish I could erase the time that you took 
That you took from me 


Insane in vain 
Who do you think you are 
I'm still standing 
I'm still breathing 
Don't hang your shit on me 
Insane in vain 
This time you've gone too far 
Who do you think you are 

You pinned me down 
You had it all worked out a plastic cage 
You thought that I would move right in 

You got me, got me, got me good 
You thought you had me on your hook 
Wish I could erase the time that you took 
That you took from me 



Insane in vain 
Who do you think you are 
I'm still standing 
I'm still breathing 
Don't hang your shit on me 
Insane in vain 
This time you've gone too far 
Who do you think you are 

And maybe I should have known before 
Too many signs that I ignored 
That you'd be a dead end street to me 
There was nothing that you could give 
Now rage is all that you left me with 


Insane in vain 
Who do you think you are 
I'm still standing 
I'm still breathing In 
Don't hang your shit on me 
Insane in vain 
This time you've gone too far 
Who do you think you are



This is only a dream.
And when you wake up
You'll start to realize 
That the world around you is dodging the same bullet as you.
Keep still, keep breathing.
Don't stop believing in what you feel is right.
In what keeps you, keeps you alive tonight.

All we are
And all we need is the faith that is inside of us 
And to know that we can see through this.
Tonight the ground began to shake as we fell down to our knees.
But we keep moving on.

So we will follow behind each other
As far as we can go until we're left alone.
Whisper to ourselves just to let it all out 
We were never even ready to sail the seven seals on our own, Oh no.

All we are 
And all we need is the faith that is inside of us
And to know that we can see through this.
Tonight the ground began to shake as we fell down to our knees.
But we keep moving on.

We all
We all gather 
We all
We all gather around.
To watch this crumble beneath our feet
As we're stranded on the edges of our seats.

Hiding inside gray walls.
Waiting above it all.
Watching our future burn.
Knowing nowhere to turn

All we are 
And all we need is the faith that is inside of us
And to know that we can see through this.
Tonight the ground began to shake as we fell down to our knees.
But we keep moving on.



Almost doing things we used to do
There's a boy here and he's almost you
Almost all the things that your eyes once promised
I see in his, too
Now your eyes are red from crying

Almost blue
Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be

Almost blue
It's almost touching, it will almost do
There's a part of me that's always true
Always
Not all good things come to an end, now it is only a chosen few
I've seen such an unhappy couple

Almost me
Almost you
Almost blue



Follow it all back
Then you take my dreams of nothing
You regard them all with nothing
Through the unknown we go back
You find the new and you take it back
Unil you take my dreams of nothing

Make it in together
So it feels like we belong
To a place we feel together
So it feels like we're all gone
When we're gone for forever
I'll be gone for forever

You follow it back
You follow it all back
Then you take my dreams of nothing
To regard them all with nothing
Between the road and the water's edge
An acolyte of disorder
And then you bury my dreams of nothing

We make it in together
So it feels like we belong
We re-unite together
So it feels like we're all gone
When they're gone for forever
Then I'm gone for forever



The cyclone sailed her heart
Through the house she flows
And lifts his bride from the ground
And through the trees
He clung to them both
And their twisted sheets
Don't know why she came here
But she won't take her away.
And by the vineyard wall
He caught her flaxen hair
And the cyclone paused
And stayed where he held her high
Her eyes stroked the plain
Far far away.

Through the black port
The cyclone sailed her heart
Where the bora blows
A wind that cries through the town
Across the sea
She says she won't go
In these foreign streets
And the road that came here
Is the road that takes you away.
By the station wall
She left them standing there
Her eyes stroked the plain
Far far away.



Time, beckoning me
Who knows when 
We shall meet again, if ever
But time keeps flowing
Like a river to the sea

Goodbye my love
Maybe for forever
Goodbye my love
The tide waits for me
Who knows when
We shall meet again, if ever
But time keeps flowing
Like a river on and on
To the sea, to the sea

'Til it's gone forever
Gone forever
Gone forevermore

Goodbye my friend
Goodbye my love
Maybe for forever
Goodbye my friend
Who knows when 
We shall meet again
The stars wait for me
Who knows where
We shall meet again, if ever
But time keeps flowing
Like a river on and on
To the sea, to the sea

'Til it's gone forever
Gone forever
Gone forever
Gone forever now
Forevermore, forevermore



Of the sweetheart highway
It was me, I admit I had the map
This is what I gotta say

We're in Bummed Out City
That's what the sign says
I plead your mercy and your pity
Is not life a mirror maze?

The hardware store is never open
Until the quarter of the moon
Let's leave town before the rodeo
Rides in with the typhoon

We're in Bummed Out City
So come on, let's operate
Let's open a disc brake parlor
No, it never is too late

Before you know it, you'll be in Bummed Out City
In a cloud of dust and rust
And all the dogs biting on your exhaust pipe
Even they gonna show you trust

And it was me, drove off the off ramp
Of the sweetheart highway
It was me, I admit I had the map
This is what I gotta say

We're in Bummed Out City
That's what the sign says
I plead your mercy and your pity
Is not life a mirror maze?

We're in Bummed Out City
That's what the sign says
I plead your mercy and your pity
Is not life a mirror maze?

We're in Bummed Out City
That's what the sign says
I plead your mercy and your pity
Is not life a mirror maze?

We're in Bummed Out City
I plead your mercy and your pity
Is not life a mirror maze?



Go for a ride 

Bombarded by philosophies that satisfy the surface
I flee to something deeper
At the risk of seeking purpose
How can I hang in this environmental state of being
When everything I'm striving for
Is nothing that I'm seeing 

Won't You take my heart, won't You take my soul
Won't You come and make me whole again
You, You've got what I need and You never retreat
Unto You I will concede 

So help me God
To put my faith in You
So help me God
Before I come unglued
Call it my addiction
I can't get enough of You
So help me God
To put my faith in You 

Infected by the skin I'm in this starving with desire
And Jesus ain't the latest thing to come across the wire
I throw myself at mercy for I am the chief of sinners
But daily taking up my cross
Has brought it's share of splinters 

You're there when I call
And You're there when I fall
Even though I don't deserve it all
You, You light my way
Through the night and the day
And from You I will not stray 


vamp 


God so help me
This is my soul plea
I'm desperately devoted
I can't get enough of You
So help me God 

Cause You are the one I love
Cause You are the one I need
I need you
Cause You are the one I'm seeking
Every single day
Cause You are the one for me 

I just walked into a meet in 3...
And everybody's starin' at me...
I gotta go

Save me from this prison

From this misery

I've been lost in my own place

How far is Heaven?

My ways of living

A see-saw, I've had it walked again
You don't like what you see
You must not care for me


There's really nothin' to it
And that is all I know
There's really nothin' to it
And that is all that I will show, to you

A see-saw, I've had it walked again
A see-saw, I've had it walked again
You don't like what you see
You must not care for me



She creeps me out

He'd given words for free to all the people there. 
And though the song is the same, doesn't matter who plays, it's alright 
The paper said we'll win this war overnight. 

We were singing 
Step right up for a colurful revolution 

Now a bridge is the word for the war getting underway 
But you can't if you won't, and you could, but you dont want to stay 
And the American mind in its prime has got nothing to say 
But it's your American right to throw your vote away 

And we be singin' 
Step right up for a colorful revoultion 
Step right up 
Its the sound of the institution 

Oh no no words you know, you know nothing today hey 
But when it comes to get you, then what will you say? 
I wish the night was young 
yeah - honky tonk 

you got it boy 

And now the national defense is up in arms and out of cnotrol 
But since the market is good, the people said let it roll 
And though the song is the same, doesn't matter who plays, it's alright 
We can win this little war overnight 

We be singing 
Step right up 
Start a colorful revolution 
Everybody's got to 
Step right up 
Its the sound of the institution 

Step right up for a colorful revolution







That's were you are
You left a stain but not a scar

You move like tide
Oh, what a ride
I'll never let you go too far

Ref.
I breathe you in
You ease my pain
When you come falling down from grace
Just like summer rain

You bend my soul
You make me shiver
Put a spotlight where I stand

Blow the horns
I need attention
I've got something I want to say

Ref...

I promise
I'll be everything you can imagine
I promise
I'll be everything you didn't think of
but still need

Ref x2



I'm going fishing 'bout a quarter to nine
I see my lil lady and she looks so fine
aw my lines so tight
I figure tonight I'm gonna get a lucky bite singing

All the fishes love me
They all wanna jump on the end of my line
I love all the fishes
But I can't get you off my mind
Singing Hey....

I'm going fishin about a quarter of eight
Now come on pretty momma don't you make me wait
Something's tugging on the end of my worm.
I been fried and I've been burned singin


I'm going fishing 'bout a quarter to six
I'm a find a lil lady put her up in the mix.
The finest fish that I ever seen
Is the fish in the back of my limousine.
she looks so fine all the time
the kind of fish I'm gonna keep on the line singin




I laugh 'coz they're all the same
Stuck inside the box
While I'm running circles round the game
They're cold, I'm hot
And i know who I am
Everyone sits down, I stand up
They might walk, but I'm gonna' strut
They fit in, I stand out
Even if I have to shout
I know, I know, I'm not the same
You say yes and I say
No, no, no

Don't care what they say
I do things differently
A weirdo, no cliche
I do things differently
I guess they don't get me
I do things differently
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do things differently

Put this on the record, literally
I won't stand in a picture perfect shadow of someone
I don't wanna be
And I'm not sorry, but that's just me
You keep it neat and tidy

I color outside the lines
I'm ahead of the game
Turn around they far behind
And I know, I know I'm not the same
You say yes and I say
No, no, no

Don't care what they say
I do things differently
A weirdo, no cliche
I do things differently
I guess they don't get me
I do things differently
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do things differently

I do, I do it
I do it, do it, do it different
Like, I do, I do it
I do it, do it, do it different
Like, I do, I do it
I do it, do it, do it different
Like, I do, I do it
No, no, no



Looking at myself 
Searching for nothing 
I knew all along 
Where I belong 
Everyday I 
Stand in the light 
I can take the stage 
But you are the one 
You give me the Love 

You know what You are 
You're the star of the show 
Cuz you are the one 
I cannot breathe in, without a reason 
You're the star, You're the star, You're the star 

I'm coming home now, 
Closer to you 
You show me the way, 
You turn me into 
Something that's new 

I thought that I knew You, 
But I was only pushing You away, 
Now I can hear you 
I'll listen to every word you say



The bird, the dog, two cats
One of your babies will always
Ring on the weekend for a chat 

A beautiful garden
Too easily getting out of hand
How can you concentrate at all? 

On the high ground
You're there on your own
>From the high ground 

And from down here we can feel it
You can move the mountain with your pain
They all want to be near you
And then too soon drive home again
'Cause grief is like that
And you're like a captain on her ship -
In the end you stand alone 

On the high ground
You're there on your own
>From the high ground
You see the mourners have gone home
On the high ground
You're there on your own 

The city is spreading
Soon only numbers will be pure
And you are retreating 

And now I walk between tables
Hide in the bathroom for some peace
They want to know what has happened
We can't tell the truth it must be lived
Over and over
'Til it floats up into the sky
To your beautiful baby 

On the high ground
You're there on your own
>From the high ground
You see the mourners have gone home
On the high ground
You're there on your own 

Days of our Lives and Dr Katz
You've got a few friends left
But she's never coming back
She was the one with the questions
And the big blue eyes
On that high ground

Intentions on a scale
I weight them
You are not who yo useem to be
I weigh them
You are not who you seem to be
It's getting harder so it seems to be the ones we onced dreamed
It's getting easier to fall apart
To loose our hopes before they start
And what you did it left a mark
Of things unspken
Things undone

We've come a long way since you've gone
We kept our faith we still stayed strong
And through it all it has made us start to trust in God and guard our heart
And what you did
It left a mark
Of things unspoken
Things undone

And to forgive you
Learn to love you
To accept you
To try and trust you



Take me to the shore
And wrap me in a blind tomorrow
And I won't fight no more
And I won't scream

Maybe we'll be washed away
Maybe I just need
A holiday
A holiday
A holiday
A holiday

This time, we'll get
A room with a view and a velvet painting
And this time, we'll stay
Inside until the lights go down
Over the palm trees and the sand

Buy me the blue sky
And wrap me in clouds of blasphemy
In the end I won't ask why
You can do what you want with me

Maybe we'll be thrown away
Maybe we just need
A holiday
A holiday
A holiday
A holiday

This time, we'll get
A room with a view and a velvet painting
And this time, we'll stay
Inside until the lights come up
And everything is vermilion
And everything is vermilion

Take me to the shore
And throw me into the water
And I won't fight no more
No, I won't say a thing
And I won't say a thing
And I won't say a thing

But this time, we'll get
A room with a view and a velvet painting
And this time, we'll stay
Inside until the lights up
And everything is vermilion
And everything is vermilion



And the days are growing very short
People try their hardest to reject me
But in a way, their conscience won't be caught

Something's happening to me day by day
My pebble on the beach is getting washed away
I've given everything that was mine to give
And now I'll turn around and find that there's no time to live

So often I have seen that big wheel of fortune
Spinning for the man who holds the ace
There's many who would change their places for him
But none of them have ever seen his lonely face



Makes things feel, feel alright.
Belief, makes things true.
Things like you, you and I.

Tonight, you arrested my mind.
When you came to my defense.
With a knife in the shape of your mouth,
in the form of your body, with the wrath of a god.
Oh, you stood by me.

Belief builds from scratch.
Doesn't have to relax, it doesn't need space.
Long live the queen and I'll be the king.
In the colour of grace.

Tonight, you arrested my mind.
When you came to my defense.
With a knife in the shape of your mouth,
in the form of your body, with the wrath of a god.
Oh, you stood by me, belief.

I'm going to yell it from the rooftops.
I'll wear a sign on my chest.
That's the least I can do, it's the least I can do.

Tonight, you arrested my mind.
When you came to my defense.
With a knife, in the shape of your mouth,
in the form of your body, with the wrath of a god.
Oh, you stood by me.
And I'll stand by my belief.

Oh, I'll stand by my belief.



Late news breaking this just in
Yeah, coolin' out
Yeah, coolin' out
Yeah, coolin' out

God sure baked a lot of fruitcake, baby
When Adam met the Eden lady
They're walking the streets and they're driving cars
They're all over the country and they're running ours
They're walking on the wounded who won the war
What's the matter people - was it worth fighting for
Coolin' out

Fix that gauge or you run out of gas
A cool operator can make it last
Say, from here to Indiana and across Illinois
We're rockin the girls and a-boppin' on the boys
And I spot a little bitty on a little bam-bam
That pill poppers hopping on a city bound tram

The stars go in and the stars go out
And punk rock what it's all about
And even when you're ch-ch-ch-ch-chillin' out
You're wondering what's it all about
Coolin' out, coolin' out, coolin' out

At the G7 summit, well we've got some 25
And we're putting it into the gin supply
We want a satellite crashing outta the skies
And a firework display by ballistic missiles
I got a sneeky feeling that the poker's getting hot
Cos twice times bitten and it's third time shot, third time shot

Oh, the stars go in and the stars go out
And punk rock what it's all about
And even when you're ch-ch-ch-ch-chillin' out
You're wondering what's it all about
Coolin'
What's it all about
Let somebody else figure it out

What's it all about, what's it all about
The stars go in and the stars go out
Punk rock what it's all about
And even when you're ch-ch-ch-ch-chillin' out
Wondering what's it all about, what's it all about
What's it all about



Whatever you are
Don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday
To you

Please wait
Please wait
Oh, wait
Don't lose faith

You say that the day
Just never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
Still I know it's gonna happen someday
To you

Please wait
Don't lose faith



The way your body tells the story of the summer nights you spent away from me.
And honestly, there is no other place I'd rather be.
So sound the alarms.
It's going to take more than a miracle to save me from your charms.
So sound the alarms.
It's going to take more than a miracle.
And every smile that you fake could be your last.
Spend another night here living in the past.
And every smile that you fake could be your last.
Spend another night at home.
And suddenly, I'm seeing clearly in the places that you always kept from me.
And suddenly, there is no other place I'd rather be.



Made up my home
May never
Never leave
Going to hate those walls
Till the day I die
Seven long months
Spent in the ground
I lived in a hole
Behind them walls
Five walls made up my home
Five walls made out of stone

For seven months
It hollowed me out
Hollowed out my body
Like insects do the poppy
I did seven months on my knees
Pride was a luxury
Still I held onto you
And I had no pride
Without pride 
I held out for you

I sratched a number
Off a whole lot of numbers
Passed my fingers
Across your face
Where your picture lay
I was the walking sleeping
There was no rest for me
I had to walk that one straight path
Oh back and forth and back and forth

I've been walking
Now for ten weeks
I don't remember
I follow the line
I follow the line till the end
I don't remember
Eighty-seven days
Eighty-seven days
And just a picture

This way my ride
There was no one else inside
This was my road
It took me back
It took me forward
Four hundred miles
Four hundred miles
The open whites gates
The set me free
But I will not be
I will not be
Until four hundred miles are behind me
Who'll be there to meet me?



ArtistBand:G. Love & Special Sauce Review The Song 0

Will you let me know
If I have done you wrong today?
Cause you won't say nothing to me
And I can't help feeling that you're mad

I can't fight you anymore
I forgot what I'm fighting for
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad

Shall this moment of unsurity pass
Would you speak kind words to me
All that I'm saying is, "Please treat me nice"
And I promise I won't do no wrong

Ohhh won't you let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad

If you have plans to leave me girl
Won't you just let me know?
Cause you finally got me loving you
And now you wanna let me go

I feel like I could explode
Won't you help to ease the load?
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad



Tryin' find a life in the big world,
Somehow they're together. 

There ain't much to the mystery,
Misery loves company,
She just waves her hand and says whatever, 
Well this ain't love, this ain't love,
This ain't love at all, and he says... 

We're not Romeo, we're not Juliet,
How long does it take, to fill this emptyness,
We're just two lost souls and baby we got no regrets,
We don't wanna say bye-bye,
Babe it's just you and I, 
We're not Romeo - we're not Juliet.

He ain't pretty with his hard old heart,
Second generation immigrant scars,
And he knows that this ain't heaven, no.

She's all skinny like a cigarette,
And he's the only thing - the only thing that she respects,
And he's trying to make it better,
This ain't love, this ain't love,
This ain't love at all, and she says... 

We're not Romeo we're not Juliet,
You'd thought you'd seen it all - but you ain't seen nothin' yet, 
We're just two lost souls and baby we got no regrets,
Now it's just you and I,
We're nothin' unless we try,
We're not Romeo - not Juliet.

It has to feel right but it never does, 
It has to be perfect but it never is,
You wanna be sure but you never do,
We're not Romeo or Juliet - it's just me and you.

We're just two lost souls and baby we got no regrets,
We don't wanna say bye-bye,
Babe it's just you and I, 
We're not Romeo,
We're not Juliet,
No, no, no,
We're not Romeo, we're not Juliet, 
Oh, how long does it take to fill this emptyness,
We're just two lost souls and baby we got no regrets.

Now it's just you and I,
We're nothin' unless we try - oh no,
We're not Romeo or Juliet,
No we're not - that's a fact.



their cold bitter edge cuts deeper within.
I don't appreciate the words you say behind my back,
but it's ok.
i'm not one for getting mad.

I don't need apologies.
I don't fall for sympathy.
you can't win me back.
this will be the last time i'm kissing you goodbye.
you left me with a scar across my back.

these stones are breaking my bones as they crush me.
your careless remarks left me here to bleed.
I dont appreciate the games you play without regret, but it's ok.
i'm not one for getting mad.


your knife, my back x 4



If ya love somebody - If ya need someone,
If ya want somebody - Yeah - Well let me be the one.

I wanna - do to you, what you, do to me,
Do to you, what you, do to me.

Well let me treat ya right - Yeah - Show I care,
'Cause every night - I'll take ya there.

Do to you, what you, do to me - Baby,
Do to you, what you, do to me.

I don't want just anything,
I just want something real,
Let down your defenses baby,
Show me what you feel.

Do to you, what you, do to me,
Do to you, what you, do to me.

Ohh - Should I stay - Or should I go,
There ain't no question - I already know.

I wanna - do to you, what you, do to me,
Help me - do to you, what you, do to me.

I don't want just anything,
I just want something real,
Let down your defenses baby,
Show me what you feel.

Ahh - I really, really, really wanna,
Do to you, what you, do to me.

Ahh - Won't ya let me,
Do to you, what you, do to me,
You make me wanna,
Do to you, what you, do to me - Oh yeah!



Thinking over what's begun
Dreaming of a better place
Frightened look upon your face
'Cause you know what must be done
Execute the only one

You faked it all the way
You faked it all the way
You faked it all the way
You faked it all the way
You!

Sitting with no sound
Fucked in terms of what to do
Daydreaming of a better place
Frightened look upon my face
'Cause I know what must be done
'Till I rose the only one

You faked it all the way
You faked it all the way
You faked it all the way
You faked it all the way
You!

She executes the only one
She executes the only one
She executes the only one
She executes the only one
She executes the only one

You faked it all the way
You faked it all the way
You faked it all the way
You faked it all the way
You!



I can't complete a thought, it's hard to breathe, it keeps me awake 
I'm walking fearfully through every day, through every place, but I 
I just can not turn away 

Failing in conversation, but I wanted you to show me 
I wanted just to know me like you do 
Failing in conversation, but I'm never giving in 
Can you take away this pain i'm living in? 

I feel this silence raining down, raining down on me 
All my weaknesses for you to see, I've lost track of days 
I'm right back where I started from 
Face to face with what I've become 
But I just can not turn away



Always bear the brunt
Just sit back on you fat backsides
Till you have to face the Front
Waiting till the bully boys get you
Don't make no kind of sense
And pretty soon there'll be no room
For sitting on the fence
 
You better decide which side you're on
This ship goes down before too long
If Left is right then Right is Wrong
You better decide which side you're on
 
Too bad for the gay revolution
This is as far as we get
And if you think you're free, well listen to me
You ain't seen nothing yet
We're all gonna feel the backlash
Of puritanical power
And kicking us down into the ground
Gonna be their Finest Hour
 
You better decide which side you're on
The chips go down before too long
If Left is right then Right is Wrong
You better decide which side you're on
 
Too late, trendy thinkers
Your time is running out
Ain't no time to wonder why
Ain't no time for doubt
Joseph, Reed and Whitehouse
Are out to get your guts
You better decide which side you're on
Forget those ifs and buts



Flash, aah, he'll save every one of us

"Seemingly there is no reason for these
Extraordinary intergalactical upsets" ha ha ha
What's happening Flash?
"Only Dr. Hans Zarkov, formerly at NASA
Has provided any explanation"

Flash, aah, he's a miracle
"This morning's unprecedented solar eclipse
Is no cause for alarm"
Flash, aah, king of the impossible

He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He'll save with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman, every child
With a mighty Flash

"General Kala 
Flash Gordon approaching"
"What do you mean 
'Flash Gordon approaching'?
Open fire, all weapons!
Dispatch war rocket Ajax
To bring back his body!"

Flash, aah
"Gordon's alive!"
Flash, aah, he'll save ev'ry one of us
Just a man with a man's courage
He knows nothing but a man
But he can never fail
No one but the pure in heart
May find the golden grail oh, oh, oh, oh
"Flash, Flash I love you
But we only have fourteen hours
To save the Earth!"

Flash



And I blame the effect on the gamma ray, the gamma ray
Well, losing out on mah jong
I set my watch to Hong Kong
I blame it all on the gamma ray
I hear the triad has crossed the Tong
In Indianapolis, home of the gamma ray
The deadly gamma ray, the deadly gamma ray

And there ain't no guest list tonight at the Memorial Hall
Cher got in 'cause she's so thin
And even Evil Knievel tried to wheedle
No - the deadly gamma ray, the gamma ray
I blame it all on the gamma ray
Know why, you know why - the gamma ray

I hear there's entry only to those with green hair
In the next World's Fair because of the gamma ray
Yeah, I hear there's panic buying of shampoo
And those little pots of goo
You know why, you know why all because of the gamma ray

When Alan McGhee went to Dundee
He caused all the rock groups to flee
Yeah, I read it in the N.M.E.
It was the gamma ray

The Chief Brigadier's head began to swell
Firing off depleted uranium shells
He bombarded everything pretty well
Except for the gamma ray
Blow it all away

And then the gamma ray seemed to say
If you carry twelve margaritas on a tray
You cannot be touched in any way
By the benign, yet malevolent
Mark two chrome, gamma, gamma, gamma,
gamma, gamma, gamma, gamma, gamma ray
Gamma, gamma, gamma, gamma ray

So, let's go back to Indianapolis, oh, Indianapolis
Yeah, Indianapolis, Indianapolis
Let's go back to Indianapolis
Because it's the home of the gamma ray

Sure, I'm gettin' on a train right now
I'm outta here



You, you told me come and take a look inside
You, believe me and every single lie
But I, I failed you this time

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right...

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

I never felt like this before
Just when I leave I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

Cause there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight



A chance to lie down That confused imitation of life Eludes me now.

All routes of resistance impaired by your face
Oh fugitive hope will I see you today?

In a tunnel, on a bridge or a viaduct
We'll meet just by chance.
And in a moment or maybe just an hour or so
Renew our romance.

And if the charms of foreign places call
For changing tableaux
We will auction all our paintings
And our furniture
And take to the road ...
Do you suppose?

The patterns on the wall never change but shadows grow long
Vous n'assassinez de la realite'
C'est malheuresement.

As daylight disperses the spectres of night
My nocturnal musings don wings
And take flight



And I'm falling through the trees
And they're calling out for rain, rain

Rain and it's plain to see
Rain, what it does to me

Yeah, rain, rain pours down endlessly
Here I'm falling through the trees
And they're calling out for rain, rain

What is rain, rain is rain
Rain is God's own lydocaine
Rain is good that's understood
Rain

Rain, what it does to me
Rain, rain pours down endlessly
And I'm falling through the trees
And they're calling out for rain, rain
Rain, rain



I can hear your voice, still,
You had your fill of those little reminders,

Theres only bills and sleeping pills,
What if they're right,
What if they're right,
Note to self.

This, this isn't living,
This is merely exsiting.

Breathe, c'mon breathe
Just breathe.

"It'll all be better soon",
You say as you cross the room
To pull up the shade,
Please don't, Please don't
Please don't for my sake.

My early morning eyes,
Just can't take the light right now,
Just can't take life right now.

So turn off the light,
Just close the lid and seal me in,
I'll sleep for days and days on end,
So turn off the light,
Leave me lie here in this coffin,
I'll breathe only half as often,
So turn off the light.

This, this isn't living, So turn of the light
This is merely exsiting. So turn of the light

This, this isn't living,
This is merely exsiting.



Chiming in an apogee 
Waiting for the synergy 
Of her and me
Waiting on the light
And I never say goodnight 
Never say that I'm always right

Now with you girl I'm content to drown 
You're so high and I'm so down
This night will end sooner but much sooner now
And I'm awake in you and you're asleep in me
All the things I'll never be
Make me wonder could you see
And I said

Wait till I hit the ground harder
Wish I could wait to hear her heart beat fast
Wish I could wait til I missed her flavor
My days are numbered here
And I don't want be the last one home
Don't want be the last one home

Though I'm weak inside
I'm thriving just the same
Still calling out your name 
Wondering who it is that I should blame
Stabbing hard and buried consciousness and fear
Forgetting others I hold dear
Wondering, maybe could you hear
And I said to

Wait till I hit the ground harder
Wish I could wait to hear her heart beat fast
Wish I could wait til I missed her flavor
my days are numbered here 
And I don't want be the last one home
No, no, no, no
The last one home
Oh here we go 


And I said there you are baby
Waiting on the sun
Just staring at the sky
Said when will he be done
I said there you are baby
Waiting on the sun
Just staring at the sky
Said when will he be done

And I wish I could wait
Til I see you shaking
Wish I could wait 
To pull out of this one fast
Wish I could wait 
Til I taste your flavor
Maybe I could savor every last drop
And I said to wait til I hit the ground harder 
wish I could wait to hear, to hear your heart beat fast
wish I could wait 'til see you shaking 
My days are numbered here 
And I dont wanna be last one home
The last one home
The last one home



it's full of memories and i can't even take a peek
there's a place, full of broken promises
and i can't even bring myself to speak

and i know now everything about you 
and i can't even try to 
separate the past from every ensuing day
i try to show that i can grow
but i can't give all you can take
and i believe it all works out
when i'm in your arms

hey, if it feels so much like the way that it should 
then it doesn't matter if its wrong
hey, if it feels so much like the way that it should 
hey, maybe you're better off when i'm gone

well, i can't stand the way our lines are crossing
as i just lie here tossing, turning with the fan above my head
i'm falling down, i'm on the ground
you're in the air, you're all around
and i do believe it all works out


when i'm in your arms

hey, if it feels so much like the way that it should 
then it doesn't matter if its wrong
hey, if it feels so much like the way that it should 
hey, maybe you're better off when i'm gone

something wrong to....

hey, if it feels so much like the way that it should 
then it doesn't matter if its wrong
hey, if it feels so much like the way that it should 
hey, maybe you're better off when i'm gone

I can love and I can, to think about it
I can
but I know as I grow old, I can not be
I can't be that way
no, I, I, I, I, I do
I do believe, yeah
I, I, I, I, I, no
I do believe



Each day's like the one before
I think I'll run away
And climb higher than I've climbed before
Life should show me so much more
I think I'll run away

And you can come and we'll be calm
We'll run away together run
Things will be so much better, run
Live as we die

High, high on some green hill
We'll be laughing at reality
Glad we ran away

Climb higher than we've climbed before
Life should show us so much more
I think I'll run away
I think I'll run away
I think I'll run away, ooh



I keep on runnin' with the boys, girl, but then you knew that from the start
It must keep building up inside you, 'cause you never let it show
I know I'm hanging on the edge now, but I won't let go

I never meant to hurt you, but something was on my mind
Just give me one more chance, we can make it this time

Stay away, stay away from my heart - but I'm trying my best
Stay away, stay away from my heart

If you gave me three wishes, I'd throw two of them away
I've seen that look in your eye girl, I'd use the last one this way
We've been from rags to riches, but your love can't be bought
I'm just a junkyard dog, girl, who's afraid of being caught

You're standing in the shadows, watching everything that I do
And I know the way things must look, it couldn't be further from the truth

Stay away, stay away from my heart - I'm doing all that I can
Stay away, stay away from my heart

Remember how it used to be girl, makin' love like it's the last time
We held each other close, not knowing what we'd found
You felt the pounding of my thunder, as your rain was pouring down

I never meant to hurt you, but something was on my mind
Just give me one more chance, we can make it this time

Stay away, stay away from my heart - yeah, but I wanna stay here with you
Stay away, stay away from my heart - yeah, I'm doing all I can do
Stay away, stay away from my heart - but I wanna stay away from you
Stay away, stay away from my heart...



Here comes the little ghost
Here comes the little ghost

Oh what a bad mood he's in in the morning
Acting like that is the best thing that's going
Seems like he was always dancing around you
And I remember him spinning all over
I've been here but not for much longer
Go out and get me a hand full of powder
Red eyes and red lips that come up and kiss you
Sun coming up on a big broken picture

Here comes the little ghost
Here comes the freaky boy
Here comes the little ghost

Angel with nothing but make-up and fab things
Diamonds and fur coats and money and gold rings
Pictures of people who love ya and kick things
One for the blue boy and two for the dead kings
Here is an angel with wings on his shoulders
Very expressive cigarette holder
Here is an angel with a bow and arrow
Saying God doesn't know how to put on his halo

Here comes the little ghost
Here comes the freaky boy
Here comes the Rolls Royce
Here comes the little ghost

Here he comes
Here he comes

Here comes the freaky boy
Here comes the Rolls Royce
Here comes the little ghost
Here comes the little ghost



For half of your smile
I'm tiger-posed
I'm doggy-bagged
Crime or offence 
Don't make you cry
I love your heart 
I've combed your eyes
I see it in your feet
Racing to mine

I like to dream 
I'm caught in the sky
I hang by the fears that
Staple my life
The winter was long
The mountains were high
The fire burns blue
As I wave my goodbyes
This isn't the town where
I wanna die

I'm worth the time 
In all sincerity
I'm honestly happy 
With you

So let's make it fast
Like lightning through the cars
But just like the sixties 
We won't get very far
I'm into looks
But I'm also into books
I see it in your smile



I made my simple demand 
woah oh oh oh
I kiss you one last time goodbye
And watch you walk out of my life 
woah oh oh oh

I didn't mean to mistreat you 
I need to reach you, I need to reach you

There's gotta be a better way
Longer nights and brighter days
Better times to make you stay

My heart is buried in the ground
My hands are tied, my feet are bound 
woah oh oh oh
It's the smoke that wets my eyes
As I burn you from my life 
woah oh oh oh


I didn't mean to mistreat you
I need to reach, I need to reach you

There's gotta be a better way
Longer nights and brighter days
Better times to make you stay

Hate me tomorrow if you need to
But tonight I need to get through
Hate me tomorrow if you need to 
But tonight I need to get through

There's gotta be a better way
Longer nights and brighter days
Better times to make you stay

Hate me tomorrow if you need to 
I need to reach you, I need to reach you



Cool air surrounds 
Soft and savory 
Take me to God, you can take me to God 

No it doesn't take your 
Will to set your brace on me 
I never doubt your possibilities 
Please let go of my sleeve 

Smooth stones behind me 
Cold air surrounds 
Soft and savory 
You can take me to God, you take me to God 

No it doesn't take your 
Will to set your brace on me 
I never doubt your possibilities 
Please let go of my sleeve



Two characters both weak and strong
We chant and we dance, we draw ourselves in
Then we run from each other again


Love is so strange, how we change from day to night
Love is so strange, how we change from black to white
Ever so strange, how we change from day to night

Hey yeah

I draw a picture of your face, another time, another place
We are the ones who fell into this love
We must be in the right place


That's right, that's right, that's

Solo


That's right, that's right, yeah
Love is so strange, love is so strange, love is so strange
Ooh, love is so strange, love, how we change, yeah yeah
Love is so strange, how we change, we change, we change, we change
How much we change, much we change, yeah


That's right, that's right, yeah

Love is so strange, how we change from black to white



'Cause I've been looking for you
And where you going tonite?
'Cause I've been looking for you

You seemed a bit uptight
As you were walking out
And where you going tonite?
I'd like to find out

I'd like to find out
Find out

And whatchu doing tonite?
'Cause I would like to come with you
And whatchu doing tonite?
I'd like to come with you

You seemed a bit uptight
As you were walking out
Ay, whatchu doing tonite?
I'd like to find out

I'd like to find out
I'd like to find out

Where you going tonite?
'Cause I've been looking for you
And where you going tonite?
'Cause I've been looking for you

You seemed a bit upset
As you were walking out
Ay, where you going tonite?
I'd like to find out

I'd like to find out
I'd like to find out
I'd like to find out
I'd like to find out

Think your more than I can get
There's nothing left to say
Think your more than I can get
Don't matter anyway

Don't matter anyway



That runs between love and pride
And I tried to get sideways
Across the great divide
But my mind's eye's on the key ring
Crying in misery 
'Cause it won't spend one more evening 
Staring back to me

It may be by choice 
Or a small inner voice 
I can't say
When you add up the cost 
We all have a cross
How do you write off the loss?

Where do I go from here? 
How do I find my way?
When is it loud and clear?
That there's no turning back
No looking back

Where do I go from here?
Nobody gets away
It's a new kind of fix
For the poor and the rich
You never know what's coming next
At the turning point

The rules are unwritten 
And nobody knows the deal
Where have I been driven
Are demons behind the wheel?
Yeah, I know my days are numbered
We're only flesh and bone
And I've been left to wonder 
How it went so wrong

Is it all tailor made?
Can the sinner be saved?
I can't say
So don't hang your hat
On the knife im my back
'Cause nobody treats me like that

Where do I go from here?
How do I find my way?
When is it loud and clear?
That there's no turning back
No looking back

Where do I go from here?
Nobody gets away
It's a new kind of fix
For the poor and the rich
You never know what's coming next
At the turning point

Where do I go from here?
How do I find my way?
When is it loud and clear?
That there's no turning back
No looking back

Where do I go from here?
Nobody gets away
When is it loud and clear?
That there's no turning back
No looking back

Where do I go from here?
Nobody gets away
It's a new kind of fix
For the poor and the rich
You never know what's coming next
At the turning point



Our time is standing still
Beside me now
Waiting always

I'm not sure 
How this turned out right
Ohhhhhhhhh..........

I know something that you'll never know
I know something that you'll never know
I can always see
I know something that you'll never know
I know something that you'll never know

I'm trying today
I'm lost in a way
And I'm sorry

Please tell me
Where you are
Cause I just can't fight this all again
Take it all back

I'm not sure 
How this turned out right
Ohhhhhhhhh..........

I know something that you'll never know
I know something that you'll never know
I can always see
I know something that you'll never know
I know something that you'll never know

I'm trying today
I'm lost in a way
And I'm sorry

I know there's something that you'll never know
You know always something that you'll never know
I know there's something that you'll never know
You know always something that you'll never know

I'm trying. I'm trying, I'm trying this
I'm trying. I'm trying, I'm trying this



The wine that we threw into a chasm
Came right back at you

Now it's all so straight and narrow
And the skeptics rule the nation
The servants scream, "always wear black."

The stupid sin, romantic wishscapes
Give you a skewed impression of the realms of the magic arts
Yes, it's all over your heads so enjoy the dim vacation
The servant reads, "never wear black."  

There is no now -- you can tape that to your devil-brow
Time came before the end, my lord, explain your cattle call.
What we need is a soft second serve of your fine approximations
Shepherd read, "always wear black." 

You find the grace in true frustration
Time came before the end, my lord, explain ...







It's a feeling that I can't describe, yeah, yeah
There's something mystic in the soul connection, yeah, yeah
There's something magic in your misty eyes, yeah, yeah
Don't you say that it's all the same, yeah, yeah
Don't you say that it's all the same
No, ‘cause there's something that I can't explain
About this
There's something that I can't explain
Yeah, I can't explain
Oh no
Yeah, yeah

Before the matter’s over
I want to shape the question
I want to leave it for now
Without another mention

We should be letting go
Instead of holding on
Inside the eye of my mind
The mystery is born

No use in looking for them
You know it isn't there
And you can stare all you want
The answers won’t appear

I try to find it but I lose myself
I lose myself in you
Said I lose myself in you
Yes, I lose myself in you

And you know you're only wasting time
Breathe easy
The question in between line
Breathe easy
The feeling know no name
It is what it is
It is what it is and there is no explaining
What it is
What it is

There's something natural in the way you touch me, yeah, yeah
It's a feeling that I can't describe, yeah, yeah
There's something mystic in the soul connection, yeah, yeah
There's something magic in your misty eyes, yeah, yeah
Don't you say that it's all the same, yeah, yeah
Don't you say that it's all the same
No, ‘cause there's something that i can't explain
About this
There's something that i can't explain



O Deanna!
O Deanna
Sweet Deanna!
O Deanna
You know you are my friend, yeah
O Deanna
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul 

No carpet on the floor
And the winding cloth holds many moths
Around your Ku Klux furniture
I cum of death-head in your frock
We discuss the murder plan
We discuss murder and the murder act
Murder takes the wheel of your Cadillac
And death climbs in the back 

O Deanna
This is a car
O Deanna
This is a gun
O Deanna
And this a day number one
O Deanna
Our little crimeworn histories
Black and smoking christmas trees
And honey, it ain't mystery
Why you're a mystery to me 

We will eat out of their pantries
And their parlours
Ashy leaving in their beds
And we'll unload into their heads
On this mean season
This little angel that I squeezin'
She ain't been mean to me 

O Deanna
O Deanna!
O Deanna
You are my friend and my partner
O Deanna
On this house on the hill
O Deanna
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul 

O Deanna
I am a-knocking
O Deanna
With my toolbox and my stocking
O Deanna
And I'll meet you on the corner
O Deanna
Yes, you point it like a finger
O Deanna
And squeeze its little thing
O Deanna
Feel its kick, hear its bang
And let no worry about its issue
Don't worry about where its been
And don't worry about where it hits
Cause it just ain't yours to sin 

O Deanna
No it just ain't your to sin
O Deanna
Sweet Deanna
O Deanna
And we ain't getting any younger
O Deanna
And I don't intend gettin' any older
O Deanna
The sun a hump at my shoulder
O Deanna
O Deanna!
O Deanna
Sweet Deanna
O Deanna
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love of money
I'm down here for your soul



Hey, hey, whats your name, whats your name sir
It's 3 o clock and im lookin at my clock tick tick tick tick tock tock
Staring at the ceiling, ceiling, you know what i'm feelin feelin
We wouldn't be sitting here 
We would be steppin aout somewhere
Heels high
Head back
My nails painted black

Woah i dont know why, i dont wanna dance
Just put up my hand

Hands to the sky
Cause i can, i dont wanna dance
Just put up my hands
Ok ok alright

I dont care what they say bout me there not the ones im trying to please

Hey hey, whats your name, whats your name sir, hey hey



This is the way it was supposed to be
Free in flight
Come, anyone, take a dance with me

If you're beaten, come on
You're not alone, you're not the only one
Step out of that cage that you made for yourself
You do what you do and then it's done

Back in your room
There's one face, yeah only one
One path and one mate
These other people they just got to wait

This is your time
This is the time when you're supposed to be
Out of line and out of time
Ungroovy and unkind

Don't walk the line
Release your mind and seize your time x2
Keep it for fun, right into your heart
Get back, get back in line
I said: get back, get back in line

This thing passin', it's only time
You think it matters, but it's only time
You must be sure, you must've known
Way back, it keeps passin'
It's crossing your track

Get back
Get back in line
I said: get back
Get me back
Ah, get back
Get back in line
I said: get back
Get back in line



I hear you mourning at the dawn
Desdemona, ask which side
Of all this lying are you on

Did you build yourself a runway?
Did you tell yourself tomorrow?
Did you cry?
And are you dressed in hesitation
When you tell yourself that everything's alright?

Cause I see a distance in your smile
And what your Mondays have become
Could be the rest of your life
Desdemona, you're not dead yet
No it's not wrong
If you want everything in life under the sun
Under the sun

Desdemona, you're in love
Do not forget about yourself
Desdemona, bring the people
That you love inside your hell

Cause you are younger in the eyes of those who see you
Please forget about the time
Throw yourself out on these brave and empty branches

In the winter waiting high.

Everybody's out there killing time
But I will be damned to lets you stand here killing mine.
Don't you know we're gonna change a whole world the day
We stop waiting on the world to change

Desdemona, we are not so very different
Do you see?
At the moment braver still
Than what our minds let us believe

Even the walls the will surround you
Somehow steady by your very own hands
I don't know just how to change you
All I know is how to tell you that you can

Cause I'll never tell you how to live
But you keep on telling me
That's just the way it is
Desdemona more then anything I know
Never tell yourself that's just the way it goes
I know it goes
But what do I know



You thought a blanket of silence would strengthen your feet
Then a name came out in prophecy
Still you were terrifier that name was truth
It's truth

Brother you must find which way to go
And with grace be bold
Just take your time
Take your time
And with grace be bold

Despite truth, the talk was cheap
You thought a princess with purpose was all that you'd need
Then a name came out in prophecy
He knew that growning fire
It came from you
Yes. you

Brother you must find which way to go
And with grace be bold
Just take your time
Take your time
And with grace be bold

The clouds will come but they're not gonna stop this love
The clouds will come
Now a hole would be something
No, I was still nothing
No

Brother you must find which way to go
And with grace be bold
Just take your time
Take your time
And with grace be bold

The clouds will come but they're not gonna stop this love
The clouds will come



I'm drowing in the crowd with nothin to say
Waitin' for a better day
This is another beautiful Sunday

It's always the same old show
When trouble is comin by the door
Love jumpo through the window
Here I am alone whith nowhere to go

Soledad 

Stinkin' with your heavy perfume
The kind I will never loose
Whistlin your favourite tune
Called the Black Widow Blues

Soledad . . .

Stinkin with your heavy perfume 
Whistlin your favourite tune
"Soledad lo que a mi me va 
Soledad a mi me da la vida"



The sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles
If you won't help with mine

I gotta get down
I gotta get down
I gotta get down to, to the mine

You keep me up just one more night
I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight
You kept me up till four

I gotta get down
I gotta get down
Or I can't work there no more

A lotta poor man make a five dollar bill
But keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all 
And you can hear him cry

"Can I go, buddy
Can I go down 
Take your shift at the mine?"

Gotta get down to the Cumberland Mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland Mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made any more, I might move away

Lotta poor man got the Cumberland Blues 
He can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line 
Just to pay his union dues

I don't know now
I just don't know 
If I'm going back again

I don't know now
I just don't know 
If I'm going back again

I don't know now
I just don't know 
If I'm going back again



Save me from this prison
Lord help me get away
'Cause only you can save me now
From this misery

I've been lost in my own place
And I'm getting weary
How far is Heaven?
And I know that I need to change
My ways of living
How far is Heaven?
Lord can you tell me?

I've been locked up way too long
In this crazy world
How far is Heaven?
And I just keep on praying Lord
And just keep on living
How far is Heaven?
Yeah, Lord can you tell me?
How far is Heaven?
'Cause I just gotta know how far, yeah
How far is Heaven?
Yeah, Lord can you tell me?

Tú que estás en alto cielo
Échame tu bendición

'Cause I know there's a better place
Than this place I'm living
How far is Heaven?
And I just got to have some faith
And just keep on giving
How far is Heaven?
Yeah, Lord can you tell me?
How far is Heaven?
I just got to know how far, yeah
How far is Heaven?
Yeah, Lord can you tell me?
How far is Heaven?
'Cause I just gotta know how far...
I just wanna know how far



All things must pass away
All things have memories
Closer than their living day
No time I don't mind around you
Everything must pass away

And the words have meanings, readers have writers
Bigger than the consequence they have
You are bigger than the monuments we have
And you call yourself a heartbreaker

There's still no time I don't mind around you
The characters fall away
On a Paris street corner that fades into the day
But for unexplained reasons you publicized your life away

The words have meanings, readers have writers
It's not the consequence they have
It's bigger than the monuments we have
And yet you call yourself a heartbreaker

The words have meanings, readers have writers
They try without trying and they lie without lying
And they always lie

The words have meanings
And the meanings are bigger than the monuments we have
You are bigger than the monuments you have
And only lost when your heart was broken



As I drive too fast with my best friend 
I don't wonder if you're wondering where I am 
Cause I don't care if I ever see you again 

Well I'm sick of being compared to what you had before 
I'm sick of being what you don't want anymore 
I'm sick of being used
Bruised
And ignored 
Because that's just not what friends are for 

You were wrong 
For me you were so wrong 
I'd only come over to get it on 
Well I've got to admit that it's time to move on 

Don't give me shit
Don't give me lip 
Don't make me lose my grip on everything that I've known all along 

Well I wasted two years trying to make you mine 
Then I wasted two more as I missed every sign 
That you weren't what you seemed like you were which is fine 
Cause I don't know who I am most of the time 
But what I do know I can't show for fear that I'll throw it away 
Like every word that you say 
Like all the things that you're saving for a rainy day 
And all the times that you wouldn't have it any other way 

I was wrong
For you I was so wrong
You'd only come over to get it on
but you gotta admit
It's time to move on

Don't give me shit
Don't give me lip
Don't make me lose my grip on everything
that I've known all along
Don't lose your mind
You showed me all the signs that your not the one
Cause I've known all along
That it's time to move on

Well it's the day before our last day together 
We realize it wasn't meant to last 
We used to think that it would be forever 
But we never thought forever'd go this fast 
And now we're singing this song as loud as we can 
As we drive too fast again and again 
I don't wonder cause now I know where we stand 
And I don't care if I ever see you again

We were wrong all along
We were just wrong
All along we were just wrong
So Wrong
We were goin' strong
But we were wrong

Don't give me shit
Don't give me lip
Don't make me lose my grip on everything
that I've known all along

Don't cross the line
Don't lose your mind
You showed me all the signs that your not the one
Cause I've known all along
That it's time to move on



Starting with a mother's love
When a helping hand comes near
It becomes an empty glove

Things are not what they appear
Starting with your hopes and dreams
Just one thing in life is clear
Nothing's ever what it seems

Even babies lie
And the stars don't cry

Nothing's ever what it seems
People lie from ear to ear
Just to help their little teams
Which are not what they appear

We are wrong to begin with
Even if we were sincere
Truth is just a useful myth
Things are not what they appear

Even babies steal
And the stars don't squeal
Even babies kill
And the stars are still



Popa was king of the Congo
& deap down in the jungle
I started bangin'my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be
in my place instead of me
'cause I'm the king of bongo
The king of bongo bong.

I want to the big town
Where there's a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Lookin' for a bigger crown
So I played my Bongo
For the people of big city
But they don't go crazy
When I'm bangin' my boogie

Cause people like disco
& people like house
That's why they don't applause
When I'm bangin' on my bongo
They say what I'm a clown
Makin' too much dirty sound
They say there is no crown
For little monkey in this town

Nobody like to be
In my place instead of me
Cause nobody go crazy
When I'm bangin' on my boogie
But I don't like no disco
& I don't like the house
'cause I'm born to rock
I'm born to pogo

When I'm bangin' on my bongo
All that swing belongs to me
I'm so happy there's nobody
In my place instead of me
I'm a king whithout a crown
Hangin' loose in the big town
& I'm born to rock
I'M BORN TO POGO



I'll crumble it to bits
Cuz it's bad again
How long will it take us?
To find out that this is it
'Til it's bad again?

The leaves are falling
The leaves are falling
Turning over and over
The leaves are turning over
Getting colder and colder
The leaves are turning over

Why so many races
Fight while our children play?
Will we melt away?
Try and they'll take your best friend
Try and they'll take your head
For caring about, for caring about

The leaves are falling
The leaves are falling
Turning over and over
The leaves are turning over
Getting colder and colder
The leaves are turning over
Will we care again?
Will we care again?

Everyone passes on
And believes in what they want to
If we heal, we can feel something
That we didn't want to
There's a sign for the time
You can read it if you want to
Or everyone will become numb

They're falling
They're falling
They're falling
They're falling
They're falling



I only want my turn

Out beyond the bright ideas
Out beyond the games
After all the questions passing
After all the guests announce
Their names

I only want my turn
I only want to burn

Out beyond the neon voices
Out beyond the shame
After all the programmed choices
After all the same

I only want to burn

Out beyond the bright ideas
Out beyond the games
After all the questions passing
After all the guests announce
Their names



I've had my ups and downs
On any other day
I'd run me out of town
Now I'm standing in the middle of a good dream
Try'n to figure what I do and don't need
Hoping I can give myself a good chance
Not too proud to show the spirit that I once had I

I guess we'll wait for the night to fall
we'll Sleep right through to the breaking dawn
I guess we'll find out further down the road

Will I have the strength to take
the opportunity when it comes
Am I laid to waste if I lose my nerve and run
Now I'm standing in the middle of a good dream
waiting on a number that I can't reach
Hoping I can give myself a good chance
And not too proud to say I'd love a little romance

I Guess we'll wait for the night to fall
We'll Sleep right through to the breaking dawn
I Guess we'll find out further down the road

Ooh well I never let love sink its claws in me
Ooh all I ever asked was happiness for you

Now I'm standing in the middle of a good dream
Waiting on a number that I can't reach I

I guess we'll wait for the night to fall
We'll sleep right through to the breaking dawn
I guess we'll find out further down the road

This feeling's worth its weight in gold
Just Praying for it to unfold
I guess we'll find out further down the road

Well he just might like to know.
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face.
If you jump into your bed,
Quickly cover up your head,
Don't you lock the doors you know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way.

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
Let the bells ring out for Christmas.

When we're skating in the park,
If the storm cloud paints it dark,
Then your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way.
Now the frosticles appear
And they've frozen up my beard,
So we'll lie by the fire till the sleep simply melts them all away.

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
So, let the bells ring out for Christmas.

Solo

When the snowman brings the snow,
Well he just might like to know,
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face.
So if Santa brings that sleigh
All along the milky way,
I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow then he may decide to stay.

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
So, let the bells ring out for Christmas.

OK you lot Take It

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
Let the bells ring out for Christmas.

Why don't you give your love for Christmas



"My father dead and gone”, he said, "That poor old stubborn man,
Spent his whole life arguin’ with that red clay Georgia land.
Finally got so weak an' all he could not even walk,
It all went down from there an' I swear; he could not even talk.”
Hey, life'll wear you down now dude an' time will take its toll,
Try’na rock while I can rock, I’m try’na roll while I can roll.

My father met my ma; they almost married on the spot,
Turned eighteen in church an' moved in right back on the lot.
An' all them work years later, she's the only gal he'd known,
It might be fine for him but I got lightnin' in my bones.
I dreamed a thousand dreams; I got travelin' in my soul.
Try’na rock while I can rock, I’m try’na roll while I can roll.

They laughed at me at school an' said that I always ate too fast.
That's just what it got to when you'd always wound up last.
I've always been the smallest in a house a seven kids, 
I never got my share back there, no matter what I did.
Now I’m off an' runnin' boys with two good simple goals,
Try’na rock while I can rock, I’m try’na roll while I can roll.



Well I’m sailin' off for England soon; I’m workin' on a boat,
See this whole wide world before I’m old enough to vote.
I might write home to mama but I sure won't tell it all.
He grabbed his Guns N' Roses cap an' walked on down the hall, yeah.
"On your feet an' fine", he said, "And the next damn day you're old.”
Try’na rock while I can rock, I’m try’na roll while I can roll.


Oh yeah!



And tell me who do you take me for
You're making rules up as we go

Last call, I'm outta here
My magic trick, I disappear
Just had enough of laying low

You can't bring me down
You can't take me out
No matter what you do to me, I can take it
You can get me hurt but you know I'll make it
Breaking free, I will make you see
One of us will come crashing down and baby it ain't me
It ain't gonna be me

You're such a superstar
You really are your biggest fan
I'll crush the dream you're living in

Your game is over now
Guess it's your life for you to lose
You just can't stand to see me win

You can't bring me down
You can't take me out
No matter what you do to me, I can take it

You can get me hurt but you know I'll make it
Breaking free, I will make you see
One of us will come crashing down and baby it ain't me

It ain't gonna be me
It ain't gonna be me
It ain't gonna be me

You're the one I can do without
You say you're feeling bad
But I never made you
Couldn't make you love so you made me hate you

Breaking free, I will make you see
One of us will come crashing down and baby it ain't me

You can't bring me down
You can't take me out
No matter what you do to me, I can take it
You can get me hurt but you know I'll make it
Breaking free, I will make you see
One of us will come crashing down and baby it ain't me
It ain't me
It ain't gonna be me



When I am uncomfortable
This rollercoaster mind
My one track ride
Tell me you'll lie
Replacing my alibi
I'm a poster girl
And you're the one take guy

Dance with me
All the way
I want you to
Get me high
Dance with me
All the way
I want you to
Satisfy

I'm hanging off of a cliff
Can feel my heels start to slip
And while I live for the fall
You're my masquerade ball
Can't wait to catch that train
22's going your way
I'm a billboard sign
Here's the number to call

Dance with me
All the way

Get me high
Dance with me

And so
Here I've gone missing
So here I go

I don't wanna choose wrong from right
I love how you make me fight
And I'll circle the light
I'm racing
Light after night
I know I'll choose wrong from right
I love how you make me fight
And I'll circle the light
I'm racing
Light after night

I want you to

I want you to
Get me high

Dance with me

I need you to show me secrets
Can you breathe, so I can hear you
Say to me that you're not leaving

Sad boy flies and comes down broken
Realize that I can't without you
Cloudless blue inside of your eyes
It's so much clearer when I'm with you
No where else is where I want to be

And when you're gone I'll always know where you are
Just think of me and I will you
Since when you're gone I will always know where you are
Just think of me and you know that I will think of you



Oh how I've waited so long
For summer nights.
When there's magic in the air
And I don't have a care,
All that matters to me
Is that you are here
On summer nights.

There's a little café
Where we can hear music play.
They keep the lights turned down low
It's a place where lovers go.
There you'll hold me tight and say
Our love will always be this way
On summer nights.

At the end of the day
We can go down to the bay
And together hand in hand
We will walk along the sand
On summer nights.

In our little café
We'll dance the night away
And we know our love will be
Always true eternally.

And when the moon begins to shine
I can see that you are mine
On summer nights.

On summer nights.
On summer nights.



Means you haven't called
You haven't cared to call
No you haven't called
And yesterday night I waited up 'til three
But you didn't come
You didn't care to come
No you didn't come

And I know you don't care for me
And I know that you ain't true
But I can't understand why I'm still with you

The steady red light on my answering machine
Means you no longer care
You just don't care to care
You no longer care
And if yesterday night you would have cared to come
I still would have felt alone
'though you'd been lying next to me
I still would have felt alone

Cause I know that you don't love me
Yeah I know you don't care for me
Still I can't understand why I'm still with you
I know you don't care for me
And don't ever think that you can fool me
Any day now I will leave you



There's a chance those memories will last for an eternity
I just keep waiting, perhaps even hating to find you gone
How could something so right, turn out so wrong
I still remember the nights, in the warm summer breeze
The words of love we confessed, that came out with ease
There was nary a lie there were tears barely cried maybe one or two
Now I spend all my time crying for you.
This crying for you never ends
If tomorrow it happens again
It's not that I'm helpless; I just can't help crying for you
It's sad that we've fallin' apart
Tears pouring down in the dark
I know it's all over but I just keep crying for you
I just keep waiting, perhaps even hating to find you gone
How could something so right, turn out so wrong



Next to know you'll be running away
Since you came I've been upside down
Now I know I never wanna come down

Open up the world, climb on inside
Hold on to my hand, we're gonna take a ride


If you tire as you wander I will carry you back home
You may fall, you may stumble -- you'll never be alone
Wrap your arms around me, I will never let you go
This I swear
I'll be there
Evermore

Evermore

Watch you growing up every day
When you talk I wonder what you'll say
Build you up and make you wise and strong
Travel the road unless the travel's done

Look up at the stars that's shining tonight
As long as they are there I am right here by your side


Open up the world, climb on inside
Hold on to my hand, we're gonna take a ride


Evermore, evermore...







While you work till late at night
As you sit along and watch some movie
about guys who loves to fight

She will take off all her make-up
Brush her teeth and go to bed
Fall asleep and dream you laid your hand
Upon her head

Do you hear the calling
From a sidetrack of your mind
Singing backing vocals 
To the sound of your busy mind

You will sit in front of a paper
Sort your feelings if you can
But no matter what you think you are,
You are no long distance man

You will go out and stand there laughing
Pretend you're having fun
Getting used to people saying
Look what you've done

Do you hear the calling
From a sidetrack of your mind
Singing backing vocals
To the sound of your busy line

Twice as alone when you're together
Faking smiles and holding hands
Each one guided only by their own
Fears and demands

And together you'll walk in silence
Not knowing what to say
What was I thinking about the other day

When you get up in the morning
While you work till late at night
As you sit alone and watch.....
You fall asleep in your Hollywood light



Don't let a teardrop fall
There is no need to cry child
There is no need at all
Dry your eyes and sleep now
Let your sweet dreams flow
And when you rise know that I'll be near
Because I love you so

Don't be sad my baby girl
Don't be bad or blue
Please don't be sad my baby girl
Your daddy is here with you
Dry your eyes don't weep now
Don't let a teardrop fall
Close your eyes and sleep now
God protect us all

And God is the greatest thing
That only the fools do not know
To love God is the greatest thing
But I'm a fool and I love you so
God knows that I love you
Sleep tight my sweet child
Don't let a teardrop flow
Goodnight my sleep child

There is no need for sorrow
So dry your eyes and sleep now
Let your sweet dreams flow
And when you rise know that I'll be near
Because I love you so
God knows that I love you
Sleep tight my sweet child
Goodnight my sweet child



Some stare as you spin the gun
If you're slow to pay the dealer
Ain't nowhere you going to run

Some find a calling
Some slide through the wheel
Some hide in corners
Look for something they can feel

But I know
This son's riding on
Just like the day before
When they ride, they ride

Some find they're born again
But I believe nobody sees the light
They head for the corners
And try to outrun every night

Some need a singer
To listen if their thoughts are true
Some need a someone
But an anyone will do

If I run, they ride with me
If I burn, they're tied to me
If I turn, they're driving me
And they ride, they ride

If I run, they ride with me
If I burn, they're tied to me
If I turn, they're driving me
And they ride, they ride
And they ride, they ride
And they ride, they ride with me
They ride, they ride with me
They ride, they ride with me



I've been wasting my days
Good and reckless and true, I have danced in the dark at the edge of the water
Swinging my hips at the black and the blue
When you die will you be surrounded by friends?
Will they pray for a heaven out loud, a hope that somehow they will see you again?
And at the end of the day, knowing not what it means
Will you stand in the ashes, building a glame for the rest of your dreams?
Would you love, could you love to be ordinary?
I know its hard but I can't see you trying
Would you love, could you love to be ordinary?
'Cause I can't see you trying now 

And I see strangers at war, I see strangers at peace
Still I hang my head in confusion
It's always been a choice that's been harder for me
And at the end of the day, knowing not what it means
Will you stand in the ashes, building a flame for the rest of your dreams?
Would you love, could you love to be ordinary?
I know it's hard but I can't see you trying
Would you love, could you love to be ordinary?
No I can't see you trying now 

There's nobody left to hear me, I wish you could hear me now
There's nobody left to call because you're not around
Would you love, could you love to be ordinary?
I know it's hard but I can't see you trying
And would you love, could you love to be ordinary?
 I know it's hard but I Can't see you trying
When you die will you be surrounded by friends?
Will they pray for a heaven out loud, a hope that somehow they will see you again



And who's afraid to go to sleep?
Who's gonna care if we don't wake up?
I'm standing in line just to fill my cup

We are those lonely hearts
We are those lonely hearts
We are, those lonely hearts

Who's got the right to sing the blues?
Nobody wants to fill our shoes
Who's waiting by that telephone?
And nobody cares when we went home.

We are those lonely hearts
We are those lonely hearts
We are those lonely hearts
We are, those lonely hearts

We are those lonely hearts
We are those lonely hearts
We are, those lonely lonely hearts



Into a free flight
Your heart
A place that's so dark

Come on people
Stand up
Got to shine your light
Into your dark life
Your love
This light is made of

Your life
The warmth of sunlight
Your soul a silence
So gold

Come on people
Stand up
Got to shine your light
Into your dark life
Your love
This light is made of

Your eyes
A place where truth tries
To hide
But truth is too bright

Come on people
Stand up
Got to shine your light, on people
Stand up
Got to shine your light
Into your dark life
Your love
This light is made of

Light into your dark
Life your love…



That the only way to move is down
You're feeling fine, looking like a king
Then you turn around and you're painted like a clown.

Nights you feel you're about to win
The gold in your pocket turns to tin.

Thunder, lightning, striking again and again and again and again
Thunder and lightning striking me down.

You play the game and you just can't lose
And you're walking with your feet off the ground
Every ball seems to hit the net
Every penny that you save becomes a pound.

Just when you find peace of mind
Just look around and what do you find?

Thunder thunder, thunder, thunder lightning lightning, lightning, lightning
Striking striking, striking, striking again and again and again and again 
Thunder and lightning striking me down.

Well you play the game and you just can't lose
And you're walking with your feet off the ground
Every ball seems to hit the net
Every penny that you save becomes a pound.

Just when you find peace of mind
Just look around and what do you find ?

Thunder thunder, thunder, thunder lightning lightning, lightning, lightning
Striking striking, striking, striking  again and again and again and again
Thunder and lightning striking me down.

Thunder thunder, thunder, thunder lightning lightning, lightning, lightning
Striking striking, striking, striking  again and again and again and again
Thunder and lightning striking me down.

Louisiana hard Mississippi mean
Just got out of jail today and
You swear that you are clean

But if you feel down and lost
Don't you come running to me
Cause I don't care it all
God forgives but I don't

Made up this little song to send your ass away
Now you're knocking no my door and say you want to stay

But if you feel down and lost
Don't you come running to me
Cause I don't care it all
God forgives but I don't

I will pray for the Devil and all the things you do
But I ain't gonna waste my time waste my time praying for you
At least he gets off his ass
That's more than I can say for you
But I ain't gonna waste my time waste my time praying for you.
I will pray for the Devil and all the things you do
But I ain't gonna waste my time waste my time praying for you
Praying for you

I ain't gonna waste my time waste my time praying for you
I ain't gonna waste my time I ain't gonna waste my time 
I ain't gonna waste my time waste my time praying for you
You know, know
Praying for you



I have judged the terms, who is touched and who is harmed 
I remember well the nails that slide across my face 
I am left alone and still remains the bitter taste of you 

Know why I did everything for
You know why I'd do anything at all   

I have crucified the pretty one without a name 
These injustice scales test my weight and lay the blame 
I remember well the milk that sours within my mouth 
You have shut me down, locked me in and never let me     

Out of here I'd do anything to disappear
I'd do anything at all for 
you know why I'd do everything   

I have nothing here, the darkness shrouds a world of pain 
Only voices heard, tormented sounds and whispered names 
I remember well the misery, the twist of fate 
Still the pendulum will swing for me, it's a little late for you



We're all gonna die someday
Mama's on pills daddy's over the hill
But we're all gonna die someday 

Well it hurts down here on Earth lord
It hurts down here on Earth
It hurts down here cause we're running out of beer
But we're all gonna die someday 

We're all gonna die someday lord
We're all gonna die someday
Mama's on pills daddy's over the hill
But we're all gonna die someday 

Well all of my friends are stoned lord
All of my friends are stoned
Janie got stoned cause she couldn't get boned
But we're all gonna die someday 

We're all gonna die someday lord
We're all gonna die someday
Mama's on pills daddy's over the hill
But we're all gonna die someday 

Well they can all kiss my ass lord
They can all kiss my ass
If they want to kiss my ass well they better do it fast
'Cause we're all gonna die someday 

Yeah we're all gonna die someday lord
We're all gonna die someday
Mama's on pills daddy's over the hill
But we're all gonna die someday 

I say

We're all gonna die someday lord
We're all gonna die someday
Mama's on pills daddy's over the hill
But we're all gonna die someday



But still I took a likin' to him 
He said: "You will be somebody's treasure, 
But no one has discovered you yet." 

Jack Candy lived on Sky Valley Road 
And that's where he did business I guess 
Some say he sold a suitcase of cocaine 
But he never showed me any of that 

This is a story that I've prayed to tell X2
About the day they drove him from this town 
About the day I lost: Jack Candy 

I was walkin' up to Jack Candy's trailer 
When he shouted that I'd better head home 
The curtains closed as he went back inside 
And I trembled 'cause he wasn't alone 

This is a story that I've prayed to tell X2
About the day they drove him from this town 
About the day I lost: Jack Candy 

Some say they took him out to a clearin' 
And made him crawl until he confessed 
Some say they hung him up by his bootstraps 
Some say they let him swing in the wind 

I walked along the Sky Valley Road 
And out onto the great northern bridge 
And for hours I stared into the cold 
Sick and tired of denying I loved him 

This is a story that I've prayed to tell X2
About the day they drove him from this town X2

I've lived a lie and I have lived it well 
This is the story that I've prayed to tell 
About a love and how I let him down 
About the day I lost: Jack Candy



Then I guess she's not coming
If she's not here by now
Then I guess I don't care

Waiter, I won't waste your time anymore
You've already started to sweep down the floor
I guess she's not coming, I'll head for the door
I'll be taking my business elsewhere

It wasn't for me
That spark in her eyes
It wasn't for me
That halo in her hair

When she touched me a lump rose up in my throat
But she must act that way with any old soak
And waiter, you don't seem to share in the joke
So I'll be taking my business elsewhere

She called me her fantasy
Boldly she kissed me
I'll never get over
The sheer surprise of her

Acting that way
And I'm healing okay
But for the eyes of her
It's cold in the rain

And it's dark and it's sad
And I'll miss her tonight
On my lonely back stair
I'm sorry I took up so much of your space

I'll move down the street to a friendlier place
'Cos I guess she's not coming and you're sick of my face
I'll be taking my business elsewhere



This is insane
Just go away now
I don't feel the same

Do you get tired
Of being admired
I'm starting to think I'm insane
Cause they've got the fire
You're so damn desired
And me, well I don't feel the same
I'm in the shadow
On the ground that I've found you
So don't come to me to complain
I know you don't know
I'll tell you not to go
And you'll hang your head down in shame

I don't want you that way
You're not something I'd save
As you drop to your knees
I don't want you that way
You're not something I'd save
I watch you drop to your knees



I see you without your makeup 
You still take me breath away 
Ain't no grass that's any greener 
I know there's nothing any sweeter 
Than how you make me feel this way 

When I look in your eyes 
Any fool could realize 
Love's standin' right in front of me 

The whole world's in a hurry 
But I don't have to worry 
Cause I found what they're looking for 
She whispered baby lay your head down 
Slips off that flannel nightgown 
How could any man ever wish for more 

When I look in your eyes 
Any fool could realize 
Love's standin' right in front of me 
When I see your face 
I know I found my place 
Love's standin' right in front of me 

When I look in your eyes 
Any fool could realize 
Love's standin' right in front of me 
When I see your face 
I know I found my place 
Love's standin' right in front of me



and your lips are dry,
and I don't have to 
wonder why..

I could say nothing, 
I could say some
I'd say a lot 
with more to come

And sometimes 
It's not all bad 
whats going 
down the drain

come take a walk 
with me 
out into the 
summer rain

I walk beside you, 
I'm kind of cold. 
I really need, 
a hand to hold.

And I'm no joker 
I'll make no move
not when I'm all outside
of the groove

And sometimes 
It's not all bad 
whats going 
down the drain

come take a walk 
with me 
out into the 
summer rain

pause.

It's not all bad 
whats going 
down the drain

come take a walk 
with me 
out into the 
summer rain



Fingers tremble and the memory fades
And it's a foolish man, who tries to bluff the dealer
Jokers laughed and lady luck smiled
The aces were high and the deuces were wild
When you're down and losin', everyone's a cheater

You can't win and you can't break even
You can't get out of the game
You shouldn't stay but you ain't leavin'
'Cos your luck may change again

Just when things were going fine
Someone jumped you from behind
When you're down and losin', everyone's a cheater

You can't win and you can't break even
You can't get out of the game
You shouldn't stay but you ain't leavin'
'Cos your luck may change again

Jack of diamonds, queen of spades
Fingers tremble and the memory fades
When you're down and losin', everyone's a cheater
Well, the jokers laughed and lady luck smiled
The aces were high and the deuces were wild
And it's a foolish man, who tries to bluff the dealer

Jack of diamonds, queen of spades
Fingers tremble and the memory fades
When you're down and losin', everyone's a cheater
Well, the jokers laughed and lady luck smiled
The aces were high and the deuces were wild
And it's a foolish man, who tries to bluff the dealer



Of taking what you owe me 
No matter where you are 
I swear I'm gonna find you 
Broken wings can hold me 
You'll never make it right 
No matter where you are 
I swear I'm gonna find you 

So you want to bring me down 
If I beg to differ now 
Cause I'm never gonna be like you 
So you want to bring me down 
If I beg to differ now 
Cause I'm never gonna be like you 

Look on the bright side 
You're always on the outside 
No matter where you are 
I swear I'm gonna find you 
I can be the taker 
And you can be the faker 
No matter where you are 
I swear I'm gonna find you 

So you want to bring me down 
If I beg to differ now 
Cause I'm never gonna be like you 
So you want to bring me down 
If I beg to differ now 
Cause I'm never gonna be like you 

No matter where you are 
I swear I'm gonna find you here 
No matter where you are 
I'm walking right behind you here 
No matter where you are 
I swear I'm gonna find you here 
No matter where you are 

So you want to bring me down 
If I beg to differ now 
Cause I'm never gonna be like you 

So you want to bring me down 
If I beg to differ now 
Cause I'm never gonna be like you 
So you want to bring me down 
If I beg to differ now 
Cause I'm never gonna be like you



Changing shapes of shadowed life
Bleeding out white pastel
To true color
Path crosses path ahead
Which way do I go
Did you go, did you go
Just before I'm lost
There's a heart on the wind
 
I can hear your voice again
I can feel your love again
I hear you call

Soothing motion of a dying storm 
Morning tumbles from a golden horn
What you loved, what you lost, what you gained
Are the things that can set you free
Forgiving bridge of now and then
Time's a canyon you can cross again
Soul touches soul and the sound that they make
Will never end

I can hear your voice again
I can feel your love again
I hear you call

I can hear your voices calling me
I can feel your love again
I can hear your voices calling me

There's a hero's hand 
Breaking my fall
You drown the siren's song
When I hear you call

I can hear your voices calling me
I can feel your love again
I can hear your voices calling me
I can hear you call

I can hear your voices calling me
Calling
I can feel your love again
Calling, call
I can hear your voices calling me

I can hear your voices calling me
I can feel your love again
I can hear your voices calling me



In between your smiles theres a clue whether to scream or be silent
And the wind blows sad and joyful on our arrival onto the island
And with your sense of dislocation you make the perfect travelling companion

And the world will always seem so much younger than me when I take the boat out
A crowded world will always seem emptier to me when I take the boat out

Suspicion fills a stranger who looks beyond the horizon
All the days that I've found love and left with only my feelings to survive on
I walk the solemn line in with the rhythm of the seas around the island
And there are times to act and times to stand back and time to show whats needed to rely on

And the world will always seem so much younger than me when I take the boat out
A crowded world will always seem emptier to me when I take the boat out
When the sea answers the island oh when I take the boat out
It's emptier and silent oh when I take the boat out

How come you always seem so real defined
You put your hand in my hand make it my design
And we give what we have and we do what we can
Put your hand in my hand

How come you always seem so real defined
You put your hand in my hand make it our design
And we give what we have and we do what we can
Put your hand in my hand

And the sea answers the island oh
And the sea answers the island oh



Tries to hide herself behind her door
Her hatred is sacred
Gabriel don't need love any....she don't know

Used to be alive inside her dreams
Her life is so much harder than it seemed
She doesn't know what's said
From voices in her head
Mother cries red tears for her

She don't know you no more
She don't even know herself
She don't know you no more

I didn't mean to push her
I did nothing to push her
Isn't love and blood supposed to make her stay



Anyone that's loved in vain
Anyone that feels the same
Is there anybody waiting? 
Waiting for a chance to win
To give it up and start again

We all need something new
Something that is true
And someone else to feel it too

I feel so high - no one else would know it
I don't know why I feel the way I do
I can't let got - and I'm not scared to show it
Cuz being here feels right
Tell me - how do you feel tonight? 

Is there anybody out there? 
Anyone that can't explain
Anyone that feels no pian

Is there anybody dreaming
Dreaming of a better day
Wehn everything goes your way

We all need something new
Someting that is true
And someone else to feel it too
Someone just like you



What's there to see clear
Foggy days were fine days
What's now to see clear

I saw through myself
Now I'm done

Crazy nights were fine nights
What's there to be sane
Crazy nights they were fine nights
What's now to be sane

I saw through myself
Now I'm dead

I'm losing distance
I can't play along no more
I'm losing distance

Now I'm dead
Now I'm done



Just rewrite these words upon my grave
And look down on everything we've lost


Loose lips sink ships and leaders
For this you need to lead us on


For every drink that you put down on me
I've reread this stone a hundred times

Would you stand over these shadows
And embrace our history?


We apologise for nothing
We apologise for nothing
Heads will roll away from us but
We apologise for nothing


If I could gather strength a final time
And dream up a war to end all wars


Grazed fist red mist of vengeance
I don't fear your movements anymore


We'll celebrate this change in turning tides
This revolution won't be televised


Would you stand over these shadows
And embrace our history?


We apologise for nothing
We apologise for nothing
Heads will roll away from us but
We apologise for nothing


"Cut me out of all of this"
"Cut me out of all of this" she said
"Just cut me out of all of this"
"Cut me out of all of this" she said

Would you stand over these shadows
And embrace our history?


We apologise for nothing
Heads will roll away from us but
We apologise for nothing
We apologise for nothing



We hardly have the time to say,
Oh, what matters most of all.

Yeah you've always been the only one,
The only one to make me run,
Ohh anytime you call - Yeah anytime.

Let's not talk about the future,
Let's not talk about the days gone past,
All this time - We've been runnin' 'round in circles - Yeah.

I can feel a change a comin',
And I know we're gonna make it last,
From now on - We'll be goin' somewhere slowly,
Instead of going nowhere fast.

When everything has come and gone,
We'll look back on this road we're on,
Yeah we'll see how far we've come Yeah we've come a long way.

Let's not talk about the future,
Let's not talk about the days gone past,
All this time - We've been runnin' 'round in circles - Yeah.

Well I can feel a change a comin',
And I know we're gonna make it last,
From now on - We'll be goin' somewhere slowly,
Instead of going nowhere fast - Nowhere fast.

Yeah - Faster than the days go by,
I know we're gonna make them last,
Instead of goin' nowhere fast.

Well all this time - We've been runnin' round in circles - Yeah.

Well I can feel a change a comin',
And I know we're gonna make it last,
From now on - We'll be goin' somewhere slowly,
Oh instead of going nowhere fast,
Ain't goin', nowhere fast,
From now on - We'll be goin' somewhere slowly.



We used to fly like angels, now we're sinking like a stone
You say you're trying to help me but that ain't the way it feels
I think you're trying to kill me with those stiletto heels

Paint the town black babe and let that pendulum swing
I been stabbed in the back babe
And if you don't love me, I'll never feel a thing

And oh, one thing I know, there's only one place left for me to go

Going back to the kingdom of desire
Going down to the valley of the gun
I'm gonna stand too close to the fire
I'm gonna fly too close to the sun

They say the king of love sleeps on a velvet bed
My sheets feel like sandpaper, and my pillow feels like lead
But as sure as Atlantis sank into the sea
I'm sinking like a stone babe, that's how it's got to be

Paint the town black babe and let that pendulum swing
I been stabbed in the back babe
And if you don't love me, I'll never feel a thing

And oh, if I don't have you, there's only one thing left for me to do

Going back to the kingdom of desire
Going down to the valley of the gun
I'm gonna stand too close to the fire
I'm gonna fly too close to the sun

When you dig up God's little acre, you lose all peace of mind
You stare into the distance, looking for a sign
But that sign it never comes babe, your wishes won't come true
You keep praying for the rain while the sun beats down on you

And oh, one thing I know, there's only one place left for me to go

Going back to the kingdom of desire
Going down to the valley of the gun
I'm gonna stand too close to the fire
I'm gonna fly too close to the sun

Going back to the kingdom of desire
Going down to the valley of the gun
I'm gonna stand too close to the fire
I'm gonna fly too close to the sun

I'm gonna fly too close to the sun, yeah
I'm gonna fly too close to the sun



Refreshing bowl and it's so clear...shallow 
Best thing I've seen in my whole life...shallow 
You must return me to your beach...shallow 

So I dive, inches to the ground 
Now all right, inches to the ground 

So clean, so blue and it's so deep...shallow 
Refreshing bowl and it's so clear...shallow 
Best thing I've seen in my whole life...shallow 
You must return me to your beach...shallow 

So I dive, inches to the ground 
Now all right, inches to the ground



To heal the wounds of earth
But who am I to tell them what to do
So I'm sailing around with my head on the ground
Searching for the cure
As the world moves on
Where's the switch in my mind
For the answers I can't find
To find and reest the bad of misery
And wish that there's a light that would end up my fight
I'm running out of timw
As the world moves on
So I keep searching my soul
To heal the wounds of Earth
But who am I to tell them what say
No help, no solution for my contribution
It's driving me insane
As the world moves on



Don't get me started
Saying you're gonna leave
That's just retarded
Leaving me all alone
To throw the party
To celebrate your fate
You are departed

It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt

No more screaming at me
Don't get me started
No more saying you'll leave
That's just retarded
No more leaving alone
To throw the party
I'll just celebrate fate
You are departed

It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt

It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt



Why the long face?
You're messing up my head space!
I can see you've had a hard day-
Let's talk about it anyway

Hey- there's million ways to do the same thing
Don't you know if you got problems-
That I'm here to help you solve 'em?

Love, I'm only tryin to help-
I'm only tryin to make it through another day

I don't always say the right thing-
So let me make it better
But if I try to write it down-
Don't go tearing up my letter

Hey- there's a million ways to do the same thing
I know I don't always get it-
But you've got to give me credit

Love, I'm only tryin to help-
I'm only tryin to make it through another day

Communication shake-down
It's always the same thing
You're still my favorite meltdown
I'd give you everything
I've seen this movie before-
We give/ We take even more
You're still the team I am for-
But you can't stop keeping score!

Love, I'm only tryin to help-
I'm only tryin to make it through another day

Let me get my way
You always get your way.



Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Treat me like a prisoner
Treat me like a fool
Treat me like a loser
Use me as a tool
Face me 'til I'm hungry
Push me in the cold
Treat me like a criminal
Just a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Treat me like I'm evil
Freeze me 'til I'm cold
Beat me 'til I'm feeble
Grab me 'til I'm old
Fry me 'til I'm tired
Push me 'til I fall
Treat me like a criminal
Just a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall



I went for a Saturday bike ride. Leisurely taking time to run errands.
A harmonica and song, compact discs, many other things on the list.
Then go home to my friends.

Oh, Jula Bell, you'll go straight to heaven and not to hell for what you did for me.
Oh, Jula Bell, as of yet we do not know each other well in this story.

I'm uncertain of the time you arrived, oh, but it was right on time for you to see me.
Get here by minivan, no not corvette, and I know you won't forget what you did see.

Oh, Jula Bell, you'll go straight to heaven and not to hell for what you did for me.
Oh, Jula Bell, you got me ice and only wished me well and called the police.

The unholy roads where Hollywood and Sunset meet.
No broken bones, but I'm no cat, I didn't land on my feet.
I fell in the street. The business card said Jula Bell, Dog Camp, LA.
And we sat in the shade of Action Vacuum.
You said what you'd seen was whack and you'd be my witness.
We talked about karate as your fitness, I'd get you back soon.

Oh, Jula Bell, you were so nice, but we'll give them hell for what they did to me.



You can knock me down
And you can try to cage me
Try to cage me

You know who I am
The son of Überman
So you can try to cage me
Try to cage me

Remain untamed
'Cause you know I'm ahead of the game
You know that's my name
Remain untamed

You can touch my lips
And you can twist my tits
But you can try to cage me
Try to cage me

You can cut me loose
Let me loose the juice
But you can try to cage me
Try to cage me now

Remain untamed
'Cause you know I'm ahead of the game
You know that's my name
Remain untamed

Forever unleashed
Forever unafraid?
Forever untamed
I shall remain untamed! Hey!

Remain untamed
'Cause you know I'm ahead of the game
You know that's my name

Remain untamed
Remain insane!



I knew you'd find me, 'cause I longed you here
Are you my destiny? Is this how you'll appear?
Wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes?
Well take that coat babe, and throw it on the floor
Are you the one I've been waiting for?

As you've been moving, surely toward me
My soul has comforted and assured me
That in time my heart it will reward me
And that all will be revealed
So I've sat and I've watched an ice-age thaw
Are you the one I've been waiting for?

Out of sorrow, entire worlds have been built
Out of longing, great wonders have been willed
They're only little tears, darling, let them spill
And lay your head upon my shoulder
Outside my window, the world has gone to war
Are you the one I've been waiting for?

O we will know... won't we?
The stars will explode in the sky
But they don't... do they?
Stars have their moment and then they die

There's a man who spoke wonders though I've never met him
He said, "He who seeks finds and who knocks will be let in"
I think of you in motion and just how close you are getting
And how every little thing anticipates you
All down my veins my heart-strings call
Are you the one I've been waiting for?



No Gucci shoes - or designer boots,
I've tried the latest lines from A to Z,
But there's just one thing that looks good on me.

The only thing I want,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.

I'm not satisfied with Versace style,
Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file,
Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good,
But there's only one thing that fits like it should.

The only thing I want,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.

Yeah it's you - it could only be you,
Nobody else will ever do,
Ya baby it's you - that I stick to,
Ya we stick like glue.

The only thing I want,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.

The only thing I want - Yeah,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.



an airport hotel
I know I should be sleeping
but it's too soon to tell
if I'll fly out tomorrow
if I'll see her tomorrow
I hope that I will.

and no sound like my own voice
fading into 
this quiet december night
but I'm doing alright
I 'll make a phone call or two 

Could I get some room service please?

about a few things I need

"Do you think you could
bring me my girlfriend
and a bottle of wine
bring me a future
just make sure it's mine
will you open the window 
but leave out the cold
could you make a phone call to Jesus
to clean up my soul"

Miles from my own bed
further from content
I guess I should get used to this
still rain on the runway
but I'm doing okay
I 've got cigarettes to kiss

"Could I get some room service please?
I 'm down on my knees
I 'm only here for tonight
'cause they fucked up my flight
serenading the wall
and I thought I should call 
you to ask for it all
for it all
for it all

Remember to 

Bring me my girlfriend
and a bottle of wine
bring me a future
make sure it's mine
will you open the window 
but leave out the cold
could you make a phone call to jesus
to clean up my soul."

Dial seven for a savior
"is this soul keeping please...
could you put me through to jesus
I 'll pay your long-distance fees"

I said "that's wonderful sir. but I don't read it anymore"
I don't read it any more...

Bring me my girlfriend

but leave out the cold
could you make a phone call to jesus
to clean up my soul"

I can't keep these secrets to myself. 
My lips have been sealed tight for so long.
Here we are now face to face again 
And my guilt is starting to set in. 
But there's something keeping me from letting my words flow. 
I'm desperate for inspiration.
Excuses are long gone.

Rescue me from what I've become 
Because I'm too far along to give this up on my own. 

Temptation is in full effect. 
I'm torn but I haven't caved in yet, 
To the problems I'll create from letting my guard down. 
I'm done with living in regret 
And my past is starting to reflect. 
This cycle will continue for to long. 

I'm as shallow as they come 
With my self on my mind.
I indulge in the finer things of life. 
But my ego's to strung out. 
There's no self to absorb. 
And I'm finding out the hard way there's more of me to explore. 

Rescue me from what I've become
Because I'm too far along to give this up on my own. 
Change the way I deal with out my self-control,
There is no doubt 
I can give this up on my own. 

It's happening. 
I'm dying to be reborn. 
Rescue me. 
Rescue me from what I've become

Rescue me from what I've become 
Because I'm too far along to give this up on my own. Give this up 
Change the way I deal with out my self-control, 
There is no doubt I can give this up on my own.



Into my painted wings.
What man can resist,
When the Siren sings.

Let not your ears be deadened,
By the ocean's roar.
Just hear my sweet lament,
And I'll ask no more.

Give up your will to me,
Give up your will to me.

You've traveled far, my love,
And the sea's been cruel.
Come rest with awhile,
Why act like a fool.

For I will guide your ship,
To my welcome shore.
So give your soul to me,
When you hear the call.

Give up your will to me,
Give up your will to me, I know you have to.
Give up your will to me,
Give up your will to me.

Upon this crimson rock,
Your body lying still.
And from your broken veins,
I will drink my fill.

Your love has given me,
Meaning to my song.
Within my empty heart,
Is where your blood belong.

Give up your will to me,
Give up your will to me, I know you have to.
Give up your will to me,
Give up your will to me.

Give up your will to me,
Give up your will to me.



I hope you break every bone
I hope it kills you on your way down
And I hope you die alone

All of your hate and all of your lies
Will it be worth it
When all of your friends refuse to be alibis
Will it be worth it

I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down

It's kind of sad to watch you break down
You greedy fuck you pissed it all away
So who will catch you on your way down
You've only got yourself to blame

When all your worst fears materialize
Will it be worth it
There's nobody left who cares you're alive
Was it worth it

I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
Way down
Way down
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down



Midnight flight to Pittsburgh
Rockin' and rollin' and my suitcase was stolen
Two shows, everything goes
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Slippin' and slidin', I'm all ripped up and writhin'

Well, I should have known, known
99 days and my body is wasted
I should have known, known
99 days and the pull gets stronger, oh
99 days, I can't take no longer

Salt Lake, Saint Paul
Punch out at the Mets Hall
Rockin' and rollin', my amps keep exploding
French fries, hair pies
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Jumpin' and jivin' and the checks ain't arrivin'

Well, I should have known, known
99 days and there's no one smilin'
I should have known, known
99 days and the push gets harder, oh
99 days, I can't go no farther

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na Oh
Na na na na na na
I should have known, known
Look out!
I should have known, known
99 days and the pull gets stronger
Whoa yeah
99 days, I can't take no longer



You better use it
Your gonna need her when you lest expect it

Money runs
What do you spend it on
We are too busy just to take what you need
This heart could heal
If you had courage just to say what you feel
Speak mother tongue
You're gonna come
Into the fold where we all feel good

Did you want an advice for love and life
well this was all we knew
We visit here but once my love now
What you gonna do?

Here it comes
I better use it
I think of nothing as I'm spinning on an axis
In place
But do you dedicate
Oh my mood will always turn

A sweeter skin
There's never been
Why I just made you Out of my subsconscious
Speak mother tongue
You gonna come
Into the fold where we all feel good

Did you want an advice for love and life
well this was all we knew
We visit here but once my love now
What you gonna do?



Of blue and gold it was
Of aching nights
And sleep-all days
I made my way to meet you
By then the air had changed
And you had seen me everywhere and they sparkled
And shined like new
Like you said I used to
Another magic day is lost on you
And all the love falls through your fingers
Another living day is lost and gone on you

One night you took me driving
You coloured everyone in shades that I'd never seen
You said someone had left you
You'd tried your very best
What silver clouded eyes see
Saying stay when leaving me
When I'm all that you need
Another magic day is lost on you
And all the love falls through your fingers
Another living day is lost and gone on you

If you could feel it now
Warmer than magenta skies
My spirits burning just like the blazing cheeks on the face
Of a young child
And it's wild

Another magic day is lost on you
What a day another living day



If somehow I must disappear
I don't know what to do
To somehow become millionaire

It's so alarming
It's so alarming
It's so alarming

I'm playing with dinosaur
And I'm asking for more and more
Everything's such a bore
My playmates disappear
They're all outdoors

I don't know what to do
To somehow, to get my head clear
I don't know why it's cool
To play king in some other frontier

It's so alarming
It's so alarming
It's so alarming

Playing with dinosaur
And I'm asking for more and more
Everything's such a bore
My playmates disappear
They're all outdoors



and I think about you
I come through here quite often
and I wonder what you do

a wrong turn at the corner
I could say I got lost
a confusion of memories
where two streets crossed

the vision I remember
is eyes through the steam
coming off the coffee
and rising off the cream

and I don't even know you
and I don't mean to stare
but I know what you're thinking
I can see that you dare to

care about people
and look into their lives
as you hand them a spoon
as you polish the knives
you reach out and touch one
every once in a while
with off handed wisdom
or a lop-sided smile

now they say don't talk to strangers
I say, "why the hell not"
if you don't talk to strangers
tell me what have you got?
a world without wisdom
a life without laughs
a season of lonliness
and friendships in halfs

do you care about strangers
and look into their lives
their sons and their daughters
their husbands and wives

so I come here for coffee
and I watch your face
to see secret kindness
and watch quiet grace



With nobody else
I drink alone, yeah
With nobody else
You know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

Every morning just before breakfast
I don't want no coffee or tea
Just me and good buddy Weiser
That's all I ever need
'Cause I drink alone, yeah
With nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

The other night I laid sleeping
And I woke from a terrible dream
So I caught up my pal Jack Daniel's
And his partner Jimmy Beam
And we drank alone, yeah
With nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

The other day I got invited to a party
But I stayed home instead
Just me and my pal Johnnie Walker
And his brothers Black and Red
And we drank alone, yeah
With nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

My whole family done give up on me
And it makes me feel oh so bad
The only one who will hang out with me
Is my dear Old Grand-Dad
And we drink alone, yeah
With nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself



There was nothing happening at all
Every time she puts on the radio
There was nothing going down at all, not at all

Then one fine morning, she puts on a New York station
You know, she don't believe what she heard at all
She started shaking to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock and roll

Despite all the amputations
You know, you could just go out and dance to the rock and roll station
And it was all right it was all right
Hey, baby, you know, it was all right it was all right

Jenny said when she was just about 5 years old
"You know, my parents are gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well, you know, ain't gonna help me at all, not just a tiny bit"

Then one fine morning, she turns on a New York station
She doesn't believe what she hears at all
Ooh, she started dancing to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock and roll, yeah, rock and roll

Despite all the computations
You could just change it to that rock and roll station
And baby, it was all right it was all right
Hey, it was all right it was all right
Hey, here she comes now

Now, Jenny said when she was just about five years old
"Hey, you know, there's nothing happening at all, not at all
Every time I put on the radio
You know, there's nothing going down at all, not at all"

But one fine morning, she hears a New York station
She doesn't believe what she heard at all, hey, not at all
She started dancing to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock and roll, yes, rock and roll

Ooh, despite all the computation
You know, you could just dance to a rock and roll station

All right, all right
And it was all right
Are you listening to me now?
And it was all right

Come on now, listen to me
It was all right, it was all right
Man, it was all right all right
It's all right all right

Baby, it's all right now all right
Baby, it's all right now all right
Man, it's all right all right
Said all right now all right

It's all right right now  all right
It's all right now all right

Oh, baby all right
Oh, baby all right
Oh, baby all right

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah all right
Now it's all right now all right
Ooh, it's all right now all right
Oh, oh all right
All right now all right



When she meets me at midnight
Lisa says that she has her fun
And she'll do it with just about anyone

Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says

Lisa says that she's on the run
Looking for a special one
Lisa says that every time she makes it straight
She knows her heart will break

Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says

Looking for a party, some action
Gone to make it feel okay
But what do you mind, where the time must come on down
Look at it all

Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
Ooohhh, Lisa says
Lisa says, oh
Lisa says
Lisa says



I'm cautious
Feel blue
And nauseous
What's new
It's obvious
It's you
You're gorgeous

Cos' you pick me up the floor
I've never been so good before
You keep me going on

It's so pretty now
I can feel it
I'm not kidding ya
Can't conceal it
Ain't nobody else
Gonna feel it

I keep
Your distance
It's all
Delicious
If you're su-
Perstitious
Then I'll do
The dishes

Cos' you pick me up the floor
I've never been so good before
You keep me going on

It's so pretty now
I can feel it
I'm not kidding ya
Can't conceal it
Ain't nobody else
Gonna feel it

I'm on a mission
Don't need permission
What's new
It's obvious
It's you
You're gorgeous



It's another lie 
And the steps you take to make the young girls break 
Is no surprise 
It's expected to come around 
　　 
All I know everything goes 
My way is no way it's yours 
A warm day in heaven
　　 
The life you fake will make you good they say 
It's another lie 
And the plans you make to make up for mistakes 
Are they helping out 
They're gonna get you when you're down

All I know everything goes 
My way is no way it's yours 
A warm day in heaven



In a face in the crowd
Called out your name
Just as clear and a loud
As I could without thinking
It wouldn't be you
But a lie in my head
Was a hope that died true

I saw what I thought
Was that look in your eyes
On the face of a stranger man
Standing in line
And all I know now
When it comes to you
Is that I ran outta stars
For one wish to come true

And gone are the days when I still had the time
And please tell my mother I'm doing alright
But it's slow, slow and gone is the life that I've known
The life that I've known

It's already November 
We've been driving all night

Never thought that we'd bring it this far
In a working man's town
Thought I'd see you around
On the shotgun side
With my own two eyes

Then I saw you three times
In a rear view mirror
Like the broken white stripes in the dark
Could've sworn it was you
By the light of the moon
Like a Tennessee cross in a fog

And gone are the days when I still had the time
And please tell my mother I'm doing alright
But it's slow, slow and gone is the life that I've known
The life that I've known

And gone are the days when I still had the time
And please tell my mother I'm doing alright
But it's slow, slow and gone is the life that I've known
The life that I've known



And it was all I wanted it to be
And so much more, cause we could soar
No gravity keeping me on the floor

Please don't let me float too high

Fly away with me
You've got just what I need
Will you be my rocket?

Now, now that we're here
It is so clear, this is just how that I dreamed it to be
Stars are falling
It's just you and me; the beginning

Please don't let me float too high
Fly away with me
You've got just I need
Will you be my rocket?

It's strange when I feel the change
I remember that anything's possible
You're the same, you take me away
I won't hesitate or I'll crash and burn and fade

Fly away with me
You've got just what I need
Will you be my rocket?

Fly away with me
Rocket take me to the sky
You've got just what I need
Will you be my rocket tonight?



before you came
I had my friends and my freedom
I had my name

Still there was sorrow and emptyness
till you made me glad
oh and this love
i found strength
never knew i had

And this love
Is like nothing i have ever known
Take my hand
Im taking you home
Taking you home

There were days, lonely days
When the world
Wouldnt throw me a crumb
But i kept on believin
That this day would come

And this love
Is like nothig like i have ever known baby
Take my hand
Im takin you home
Im taking you home
Where we can be with the ones who really care
Home
Where we can grow old  together
Keep you in my heart forever

Oh and this love
Is like nothing i have ever known
Take my hand
Taking you home
Taking you home

Yes I am



You failed so long ago 
And what can you do about it? 
Stop your crying 
What will He ask you? 
Now that it's over with 
Behind that face there's only hope in you 
Do you have to feel this way? 
'Cause you never stay the same 
Do you notice how you change when you believe? 
Do you search but never find? 
'Cause this happens all the time 
Do you notice how you change when you believe? 
Just like I said before 
Behind that face of yours 
You hide so far away 
From everything that's right 
I'm so glad you're honest 
But your life is such a mess 
I know inside of you there's hope 
You'll find it 
And this life is all we are 
So prepare your lonely heart 
And you know it's all you have 
So breathe in 
So say you're sorry now 
This pain won't allow 
And you know it's all you have to do now



You can always cut out a door
If you can find a reason
You can always kick off a war

If you have a short fuse
You shouldn't have
The guns and the bombs
But if you have a big mouth
You can always talk your way out

It would be better if
You we're on the right side
Get on my side

You could stop now

But if you're feeling left out
You can always just drop us a bomb



Before he speaks the world around us quiets.

With eyes as sharp as arrows and turning to the fire
He clears the air and cuts it with a feather.

Many in a circle slowly 'round the fire
When he is gone I want to know him better.

No one is forsaken, no one is a liar,
He plants the tree of life on our foreheads with water.

He hums, there are drums, four winds, rising suns,
We are singing and playing, I hear what he's saying.

I remember breezes from winds inside your body
keep me high, like I told you, I'll sing to them this story and know why.



Fall to the ground then I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts are back to the break-up
These four walls are closing in
Think of the fix you put me in

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong but since you been gone
You've cast a spell, so break it
Doo doo doo, doodoo doo doo, doodoo doo doo, can't take it

And in the night I stand beneath the back street lights
I read the words that you sent to me
I could take the afternoon but night time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me
Your poison letter, your telegram
They go to show you don't give a damn


ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh....
And if you need me back
Baby I'm here whenever you want
Doo doo doo

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong but since you been gone
You've cast a spell, so break it
Doo doo doo, doodoo doo doo, doodoo doo doo, doodoo doo doo
Ever since you been gone

Since you been gone
Since you been gone
Doodoo doo doo, doo doo doo
Ever since you been gone



You're fucken awesome 
You're fucken awesome 
You're fucken awesome 

I'm just diggin' ya now 
I'm diggin' ya now 
I'm just diggin' ya now 
I'm diggin' ya now 

Don't wanna walk away

You fill my empty day 
You know you make me stay 

'Cause you're fucken awesome 
You're fucken awesome 
You're fucken awesome 
You're fucken awesome 

I'm just diggin' ya now

You fill my empty day 
You know you make me stay 'cause

Don't wanna walk away 
I couldn't anyway 
You fill my empty day 
You know you make me stay 'cause



And I swore that it would last
I could not stand to hang around
When I saw that it was past

I turned my radio on, packed the car with all I owned
I drove into the long dark night
Sayin' I don't know where I'm goin', don't know what I'm doin
But I know I'm not goin' back

I got friends still hangin' around
Wonderin' what they're gonna do
They are still in the old college town
Drinkin' in the old bar room

With the video on, spendin' every thing they own
Drinkin' in the long dark night
Well, I don't know where I'm goin', don't know what I'm doin'
But I know I'm not goin' back

I have a friend who moved to California
He says I wouldn't call it home
I have a friend who moved to Boston
She says I wouldn't call it home
And I've been five years in New York City
But I would not call it home

I got the radio on, cussin' every thing I own
Dreamin' in the long dark night
Got the radio, got the radio on
I got the radio on, got the radio, got the radio on



It's staying in, it's gonna find another way, yeah
As I sit here in this misery
I don't think I'll ever, no Lord, see the sun from here

And oh, as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say, and they'll say
Hey, look at him, I'll never live that way
That's okay, they're just afraid to change

And when you feel life ain't worth living
You've got to stand up
Take a look around, then you look up way to the sky, yeah
And when your deepest thoughts are broken
Keep on dreamin' boy, 'cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die

And as we all play parts of tomorrow, oh no
Some ways we'll work, and other ways will play, yeah
But I know we can't all stay here forever
So I will write my words on the face of today
And they'll paint it

And oh, as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say, and they'll say
Hey look at him and where he is these days
When life is hard, you have to change
When life is hard, you have to change



From this bed I hit the floor
What day is it anyway?
Go away and close the door 
I want to cry inside
As you want to talk some sense
I've just stopped trying
It feels like i'm dying 

Please don't shout
It's only anger that your waking
Please don't shout
Can't you see i'm not listening? 

Today I cry for my sins
Tomorrow call me the fool
Depression drinks me deeper
It's like there's nothing there to lose 
Oh anger
My best friend
Why don't you pull up an easy chair?
You can't save anyone else
You can't save me from myself 

Please don't shout
It's only anger that your waking
Please don't shout
Can't you see i'm not listening?

Please don't shout
It's my patience that you're wasting
Please don't shout
Can't you see i'm not listening? 

I'm not listening
I'm not listening
Stop your shouting 
I'm not listening 

If only I could release instead of talking to myself
Every feeling that I have
Would you bury all of my doubt? 
Well you can't walk in my shoes
Every mile just feels like two
I won't keep explaining
I won't keep on trying 

So what if i'm hiding
You're giving me a headache 

Please don't shout
It's only anger that your waking
Please don't shout
Can't you see i'm not listening?

No
Please don't shout
It's my patience that you're wasting
Please don't shout
Can't you see i'm not listening? 

Please don't shout
Oh no
I've stopped listening
I'm not listening
No i'm not listening

Can't you hear me? 
I'm not listening



We turn our heads and cover our faces
Now flames devour the sky
And I hear these words in the back of my mind

Here we stand at this fork in the road
We got no time to wait
Oh, which way shall we go?
This whole world's spinnin' out of control
Oh, which way shall we go?
Which way shall we go?
I can't believe this, it makes me sick

Fresh smell of death on your tongue
You bait the hook and here come the children
Another gravestone to sell
While you get rich in the valley of Hell

Here we stand at this fork in the road
We got no time to wait
Oh, which way shall we go?
This whole world's spinnin' out of control
Oh, which way shall we go?
Which way shall we go?
I can't believe this, it makes me... sick

The devil's creepin' he's got us eatin' from his dirty hands
We feast on lies which makes it hard for us to take a stand
Out in the desert there's a forest full of fallen trees
It's what they want but, no, it's not what we need

Screamin' at the ceilin' doesn't make it better
Slipped into a coma, lost my favorite sweater
Ask 'em no more questions, you'll never catch them lyin'
It's time to make our move and strike them right between the eyes

Here we stand at this fork in the road
We got no time to waste
Oh, which way shall we go?
This whole world's spinnin' out of control
Oh, which way shall we go?
Which way shall we go?



If we hadn't won the war
And I was calling all the shots
And what I believe was done
If we hadn't sent 'em there to die
You'd be sure that we'd be doing it again

So let the union stand alone to be it
While alone my brothers singing
This is the glory of war

Though no man picks his birth
Nobody and he'd be tied
And for it he must hold the line
I guess some men be born to dyin'
'Cause livin' wasn't up to them

So know, we're all born as brothers
Livin' just to kill each other
This is the glory of war

If our flag was wavin' free
And we'd marchin' all the way
For what? I doubt they knew
If we hadn't lost a generation
You'd be sure that we'd be losin' one again

So let them all go down for nothin'
And watch that blood keep comin'
This is the glory of war

So let the union stand alone to see it
While all my brothers screamin'
This is the glory of war



Roots rock reggae!
From the month of June to the month of May:
Roots rock reggae!
Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday:
Roots rock reggae!
And I know I'm gonna love it 'til I'm old and grey:
Roots rock reggae!

Give it to me now, give it to me now
give me the roots rock reggae!

Some like jazz some like soul
some like blues or rock & roll.
Some like pop some like rock
some like house or hip hop.
When me operator put the music on the track
me grab the mike and start chat.
Man ina pants woman ina frocks
get on the dance floor and start rock.
Time for certain lyrics that are lovey dovey
time for certain lyrics that are very funny.
But when it comes to roots and reality
just turn on the mike and give it to me.

Reggae music was originated in Jamaica
by Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.
Just to mention a few 'cause there's many many more
who spread the message of love not war.
That's why reggae music has gone so far
to Europe, China and Africa.
Gone under in Australia and in America
there ain't no stopping the music of Jah!



Waiting for the world's applause
Rebel without a conscience
Martyr without a cause

Static on your frequency
Electrical storm in your veins
Raging an unreachable glory
Straining at invisible chains

And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
Staring down into a heartless sea
Can't face life on a razor's edge
Nothing's what you thought it would be

All of us get lost in the darkness
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars
All of us do time in the gutter
Dreamers turn to look at the cars

Turn around and turn around and turn around
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Don't turn your back and slam the door on me

It's not as if this barricade
Blocks the only road
It's not as if you're all alone
In wanting to explode

Someone set a bad example
Made surrender seem all right
The act of a noble warrior
Who lost the will to fight

And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
Staring down into a heartless sea
Done with life on a razor's edge
Nothing's what you thought it would be

All of us get lost in the darkness
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars
All of us do time in the gutter
Dreamers turn to look at the cars

Turn around and turn around and turn around
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Don't turn your back and slam the door on me

No hero in your tragedy 
No daring in your escape
No salutes for your surrender
Nothing noble in your fate
Christ, what have you done?

All of us get lost in the darkness
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars
All of us do time in the gutter
Dreamers turn to look at the cars

Turn around and turn around and turn around
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Don't turn your back and slam the door on me



It's all too much

When I look into your eyes
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside
The more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time
Of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are 
Or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Sail me on a silver sun
For I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere
And get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much
It's too much

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much

Too much too much too much



I was taught to never tell a lie
To look you in the eye and tell it like it is
Always thought that you would be the same
It's such a shame that's not the way it is

I was fooled by your innocence
And my love for you was so intense
With our connection only physical
If it got me through the night
Well that's a lie

Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you oh

A simple question makes you look away
Your hesitation gives it all away
There's some protection in the way you move
If there's sadness in my eyes
It's coming from your lies

Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
I believed in you

You want to sleep with me but payback's tough
Why don't you call me when you're all grown up
If there's a change in you I'll know it's true
Hey little liar I believed in you

Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar
Hey little liar
Hey little liar



I said it clearly
They mess it up instead
I mean it really

I am a god
No one understands
I am the one, I am the one
I'm the natural man, I am, yeah

Fools and idiots
Just when I want
Friends when I see it
Just when I want

I am a god
No one understands
I am the one, I am the one
I'm the natural man, I am, yeah

I'm perfect, that's for sure
I stand
In class all by myself
I am

I am a god
No one understands
I am the one, I am the one
I'm the natural man, I am, yeah



they're ruled by laws of gravity
soon this door is closing
and you'll never know unless you go
no, you'll never know if you won't go

wishing well of wonders
glitter box of dreams
inside lie bitter pills
you know I never wanted
to sing for your lover
but the angels sang of love
and outside the night was falling

fly - fiery angels kiss the sky
won't you shine your light down on me
fly - through the blazing cosmic eye
no, you'll never know if you won't go 

eleven ways to lose your mind
seven ways to shine
four doors that may take you in
one that's closed behind
I should have seen you leaving
but I never thought you'd go
no, I never thought you'd walk away

it's getting dark, too dark to see
and angel's a long time gone
too many things I can't combine
with logic reason
how can I tell the black from white
if all is black and blue?
god knows where i'm going
when the keeper waves me through...



And she, she sang me a song then took me off to bed 
And when I said to her "tomorrow girl, I just can't stay" 
But don't be sad now my darlin' 
I'll be back someday
I guess love has a-taken it's toll 
Well, oh no. well, alright. 
Two more steps and I'm on my way 
Well, ok. alright 
Oh, I love her. yes I do. 
Oh, I love her. and it's true 
Oh, and when I sing this song 
You know I've been moving on 
And it's true. I want you. 
Oh hey, hey! 
Oh hey hey hey 
Oh hey hey hey 
Oh no no no 
Well she, she told me a story how we won this war 
And I, I got another drink and I layed down on her floor. 
And when I said to her "don't you bother when we're apart" 
And don't be sad now my darlin' 
I won't a-break your heart 
Well, I think I'm a-leavin' today. 
Well, ok. Well, alright. 
Two more steps and i'm on my way. 
Well, ok. alright. 
Oh, I love her. yes I do. 
Oh, I love her. and it's true 
Oh, and when I sing this song 
You know I've been moving on 
But it's you. I love you 
Oh hey, hoo! 
Oh hey hey hey 
Oh hey hey hey 
Oh hey hey hey 
Hey!



When I'm in your arms - I know I've found the one,
I love you kiss me mouth - And your static touch,
It's just the way you are - Makes me feel so much - Yeah.

No one could ever know - What we're like alone,
Rollin' round like rain - We're a midnight storm,
Like a river rising - I feel it through your skin,
When we're together - Oh I never want it to end - No.

I thought I'd seen everything - 'til I saw you,
I thought I'd been everywhere - 'til I'd been with you,
I thought that everyone - Knew what I knew,
I thought I'd seen everything - 'til I saw you.

I like the way we are - Like the ragin' fire,
Burin' up the night - Burnin' with desire,
You're such a sweet temptation,
You know I can't resist,
Electricity, hey, everytime we kiss - Oh!

I thought I'd seen everything - 'til I saw you,
I thought I'd been everywhere - 'til I'd been with you,
I thought that everyone - Knew what I knew,
I thought I'd seen everything - 'til I saw you.
Yeah I saw right through,
Oh I seen it comin'.

Hey - I thought I'd seen everything - 'til I saw you,
I thought I'd been everywhere - 'til I'd been with you,
I thought that everyone - Knew what I knew,
I thought I'd been everywhere,
I thought I'd seen everything,
Aww, 'til I saw you.

And stranger still my self control I can't rely on anymore
New tide, surprise, my world is changing
Within this frame an ocean swell behind the smile, I know it well

Beneath a lover's moon I'm waiting
I am the pilot of the storms, adrift in pleasure I may drown
I built this ship it is my making
And furthermore, my self control, I can't rely on anymore

I know why
I know why

Crazy on a ship of fools
Crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
Oh, no, oh, no

Who claims that no man is an island?
While I land up in jeopardy, more distant from you by degrees
I walk this shore in isolation
And at my feet eternity draws ever sweeter plans for me

I know why
I know why

Crazy on a ship of fools
Ah, crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
Oh, no, oh, no, ship of fools

Turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
Oh, no
Crazy on a ship of fools
Oh, crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
Oh, no, oh, no, ship of fools



You'll never know
Everything you could have been and even more
Don't be to blame
You gotta keep it moving on

Up the middle and out the end
Why kid yourself it's not so easy you pretend
That we are all the same
When we're playing the game

I need you to
Tell me you're all right
It's not the end of our ride
Tell me you're uptight
Will you forget about yesterday

Pick up the pieces
And carry on
Don't look back
Don't regret
Don't become someone always holding on

Tell me you're all right
It's no the end of our ride
Tell me you're uptight
Will you forget about yesterday


You've said enough
Not listening
Not following
You've said enough
Take a seat in the back while I wait for you

Tell me it's daylight
It's not the end of our ride
Tell me you're uptight
Will you forget about yesterday

Tell me it's daylight
It's not the end of our ride
Dammed if it is
Dammed if it ain't
Will you forget about yesterday

Dammed if it is
Dammed if it ain't
Will you forget about yesterday

Tell me you're alright
Will you forget about yesterday
Tell me you're alright
Will you forget about yesterday



Some days are longer
I sold my skin
I sold the skin that I am in for a plan

My out of style is coming back
I'm bored but I'm excited
Our out of style is coming back
We're bored but we're excited

Some days are more
Some days than others
I'll shed my skin
I'll shed my

My out of style is coming back
I'm bored but I'm excited
Our out of style is coming back
We're bored but we're excited

And I tried but it failed me
Like everything that's cool is old in my skull
And I tried but it failed me
Living only to die dumb

My out of style is coming back
I'm bored but I'm, bored but I'm
Our out of style is coming back
I'm bored and I'm crooked like
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody
And everybody, oh



I've lived a lonely lifetime
All because I never had a girl like you
To hold me tight

And since you came around
And showed your way to me
I'm beginning to think that I'll
Never be blue anymore

Now that you're in my life
You are my brightest day
When you came, you chased my blues away

And you know you're all that I been waitin' on
And all the stars I wish upon
And so I say Thank you for bein' there
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright
Thank you for lovin' me
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright

Anytime of day
Since I heard you spoe
And you know that you're all 
You're the queen of all my dreams

And so I say Thank you for bein' there
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright
On my knees, it's days like these
When all I see is you and me

These days it seems as though
I've lived a lonely lifetime
All because I never had a girl like you
To hold me tight

And since you came around
And showed your way to me
I'm beginning to think that I'll
Never be blue anymore

Now that you're in my life
You are my brightest day
When you came, you chased my blues away

And you know you're all that I been waitin' on
And all the stars I wish upon
And so I say Thank you for bein' there
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright
So thank you for lovin' me like you did before
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright



Now everyone can fear you, no one dare look in your eyes 
When trouble follows your every move, the description always fits your face 
You'll have me sure gonna have to prove, the failure you'll have to take

And as the night goes on, the stories unfold 
Tales of how many drinks you can hold 
How many pigs it took to hold you down 
And how many thieves it takes to steal the town

I can't be bothered with him, he's gonna treat me this way 
I'm in the back seat and your never going my way 
What does he have to treat me bad 
There's no more chances for Jack The Lad

No one ever confronted you, you're never without a crowd 
The thought had never cross your mind to do your mother proud 
Mugging's your speciality on which you all have bailed 
I do believe it's the reason, for this life you'd be even insane 

And as the night goes on, the stories unfold 
Tales of how many drinks you can hold 
How many pigs it took to hold you down 
And how many thieves it takes to steal the town

I can't be bothered with him, he's gonna treat me this way 
I'm in the back seat and your never going my way 
What does he have to treat me bad

I can't be bothered with him, he's gonna treat me this way 
I'm in the back seat and your never going my way 
What does he have to treat me bad 
There's no more chances for Jack The Lad



Train arrive 16 coaches long
Train arrive 16 coaches long
Well that long black train
Took my baby and gone

Train, train rollin' around the bend
Train, train, train, rollin' around the bend
Well it took my baby
Away from me again

Come down to the station
To meet my baby at the gate
Asked the station master
If my train's a-running late
He said "If you're a-waiting
On the 444
I hate to tell you son
That train don't stop here any more"

Train train, train, rollin', around the bend
Train train, train, rollin', around the bend
Well it took my baby
Away from me again

Heard that whistle blowin'
It was the middle of the night
When I got down to the station
The train was pulling out of sight

Mystery train rollin' around the bend
Mystery train rollin' around the bend
Well it took my baby
Away from me again



Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down,
I'll be lazing on a Sunday Afternoon

Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the Zoo

I come from London town, I'm just an ordinary guy,
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre

I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night
There he goes again
I'll be lazing on a Sunday 
Lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon



You should've known better than to walk away
One last time

It's feeling like we're falling out of place
I think it's time to look inside look inside
Now look behind my heart that's racing faster when
We're on and off and on again

These signals, they take a piece of my heart
It feels as though we're falling apart
This situation's dragging on and on again
These signals they take a piece of my heart
It feels as though we're falling apart
These complications have me shaking my head but I won't be shaken

Falling in my arms you lie awake
I take apart the look that's on your face
On last time
It's feeling like it's all too much too take
I think it's time to look behind, look behind
'Cause ever time my eyes are aching for an end
We're on and off and on again

These signals, they take a piece of my heart
It feels as though we're falling apart
This situation's dragging on and on again
These signals they take a piece of my heart
It feels as though we're falling apart
These complications have me shaking my head but I won't be shaken

Too far too late too much to take
Feels like the breaks are wasting my time away
Another heartache
Tangled but I won't pretend we're on again

These signals, they take a piece of my heart
It feels as though we're falling apart
This situation's dragging on and on again
These signals, they take a piece of my heart
It feels as though we're falling apart
These complications have me shaking my head but I won't be shaken



I found it tucked beneath the hills
I sat and watched it rise
It hit the sky and burst to flames
The lotus flowers got me thinkin'
'Bout the way that we live
I got this feeling
It's gonna stop

Driven by religion, running backwards
Down a one-way road
A course collision, split decision
Tryin' to save your soul
Manifest destiny
Is just a fancy word for murder
I got this feeling
It's gonna stop

A billion faces running 'round my head
All got opinions but they don't mean shit
Keep dropping bombs until the whole world's dead
They'll say it's all been done and it's all been said

They'll turn this message into a pop movement
A fascist statement, call it politics
You can mark my words they'll put a spin on it
They'll say it's all been done

Look outside the box my friend
Your heart's been dead since who knows when
It seems we've missed the mark
Lost all hope and given in
Pack up the suitcase, take that
Handkerchief and wipe off your chin
The fear that drives you
Needs to be stopped

A billion faces running 'round my head
All got opinions but they don't mean shit
Keep dropping bombs until the whole world's dead
They'll say it's all been done and it's all been said

They'll turn our message into a pop movement
A fascist statement, call it politics
You can mark my words they'll put a spin on it
They'll say it's all been done

Fell into a daze and found
My mind was gone and laid to waste
A battle ground indeed
Where holy wars have taken place
I saw the sunset, watched it
Travel down and tear through the ground
The hate that drives us
Needs to be stopped



Where will you go?
Who will be waiting for you there when you get home?

What is the distance between your heart?
And where you wish that you were headed, is it far?
Maybe our madness is the only thing we have
Where you go with your machete in your hand?

I'm counting slowly
Barely breaking even
And I'm inclined to be your friend
I'm inclined to meet ya

We all need something
What do you need?
What are you building with your possibilities?

Put up your passion man
Put down your fist
Nobody warns you that your life can twist like this

We tow the line
We break the backs of our hands
And I'll build you a castle if you bring me some sand

I'm counting slowly
Barely breaking even
And I'm inclined to be your friend
I'm inclined to meet you

Nobody ever gets to know from keeping secrets
If you go the road alone
I bet it's gonna beat you

Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line

I'm counting slowly
Barely breaking even
And I'm inclined to be your friend
I'm inclined to meet you
Nobody ever gets to know from keeping secrets
If you go the road alone
I bet it's gonna beat you

Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line
Toe the line



Show what you're made of, surprise us both
Fly in the night, slow down town
Brake too fast, and bring us round, bring us round
And the finest days have come
Summer nights go on so long
So high I might as well be gone

And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
You're the last one standing

Lean and hungry with a fire in your eyes
I'll play catch up, you can show me where it's at
I'll go along with anything that you want to do
Every day I'm making ground
So high I might as well be gone

And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
When you're walking into my house
I'll be the last one standing

If you want you can get there
Night vision can I find your
White doves land in your treasure tower
And I promise that I won't look back
Every day I'm making ground
So high I might as well be gone

And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
When you're walking into my house
I'll be the last one standing

And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
When you're walking into my house
I'll be the last one standing



I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday i don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate...
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Fridays never hesitate...

Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday
I'm in love



You go from zero to ticked off and losing it
Could somebody please tell me what just happened then

Manage to always ruin the mood somehow
Well I'm over combing through the details now
Far too complicated to bother with it

All you people gather round and listen up
His Majesty the Baby has got something up
His bottle's empty and his nappy's come unstuck
All the kingdom must shut up

Forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn
But I'm not as young as I used to be
And you live and you learn
Forgive me if I'm pushing on my luck
But I've been through this a million times and now I'll have no truck with it
No truck

Yeah we all got luggage and we all got scars
But I know for a fact it shouldn't be this hard
I've seen it on Dr Phil, I know all about it

And no I'm not mad, I just don't wanna play
I know the script and I hate that game
Think His Majesty the Baby is overtired

All you people gather round and listen up
His Majesty the Baby has got something up
His bottle's empty and his nappy's come unstuck
All the kingdom must shut up

Forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn
But I'm not as young as I used to be
And you live and you learn
Forgive me if I'm pushing on my luck
But I've been through this a million times and now I'll have no truck with it
No truck



And halfway into something else,
I don't know what to do.

You said you'd make it easy,
You said you'd take the time,
But you called it off,
Before I change my mind.

'cause you're not decided,
You're only hidin' from love,
You can't deny it,
You're only hidin' from love.

Well I've been makin' changes,
But you've been changin' too,
You were hopin' love was somethin' else,
I was hopin' it was you.

You said you'd make it easy, babe,
You said you'd take the time,
But you called it off,
Before I change my mind.

You're not decided,
You're only hidin' from love,
You can't deny it,
You're only hidin' from love.

I know you tried,
You're only hidin' from love,
You say you're shy,
But you're only hidin' from love.

Ohh, you're not decided,
You're only hidin' from love,
You can't deny it,
You're only hidin' from love.

Yeah, I know you tried,
You're only hidin' from love,
You say you're shy,
But you're only hidin' from love.

Ohh yeah, you're not decided,
You're only hidin' from love,
You can't deny it,
You're only hidin' from love.



Sellin books at the check out line
By the black tattoo on her back
She was lookin like the dancin kind

Her secret lies beneath the smoke and the neon lights
She works that stage every night

She's a poster princess and a dancin queen
She knows she likes her life in the center of attention her secret's safe with me
Now i'm fallin for her and the night's not over
I know she likes her life in the center of attention she's comin home with me

Morning comes with the ringin alarm
And she's tryin to get to work on time get to work on time
I can see what she's tryin to be
She's an angel with the devil's eyes with the devil's eye's

Her secret lies beneath the smoke and the neon lights
She works that stage every night

She's a poster princess and a dancin queen
She knows she likes her life in the center of attention her secret's safe with me
Now i'm fallin for her and the night's not over
I know she likes her life in the center of attention she's comin home with me

Come on, come on, come on a little closer
Come on, come home with me

She knows she likes her life in the center of attention her secret's safe with me
Now i'm fallin for her and the night's not over
I know she likes her life in the center of attention she's comin home with me



Everything on you is getting out of control
I see your fist raised up and clinched
I know you better than this

Don't hold your breath
Just get as far away as you can possibly get
I know you better than you
I'm takin' my time cause I got nothing to do

Wait a minute something's wrong
I know it won't take long
Let's burn a hole into the sky
And take a look into God's eyes

I know it don't seem right
But it won't take all night
I'm not tryin' to save the planet
I just don't like this noose I'm hangin' from

Red faced, short breathed
Yeah Im takin' it all until there's nothing left
For you to prove
Yeah I'm takin' my time cause I got nothing to do

Wait a minute something's wrong
I know it won't take long
Let's burn a hole into the sky
And take a look into God's eyes

I know it don't seem right
But it won't take all night
I'm not tryin' to save the planet
I just don't like this noose I'm hangin' from

Why don't you make up your mind
Why don't you make up your mind
Why don't you make up your mind

Why don't you make up your mind
Why don't you make up your mind
Why don't you make up your mind

Wait a minute something's wrong
I know it won't take long
Let's burn a hole into the sky
And take a look into God's eyes

I know it don't seem right
But it won't take all night
I'm not tryin' to save the planet
I just don't like this noose I'm hangin' from



And now the flames are burning me in my bed but I just don't care
We all go to sleep in the same place and in the morning hope that we're all the same
We'll just sit around like broke down cars in the lot waiting for repairs

There you go
There it goes

Well I wish that I was as good as you at caring and trusting
And I wish that my condition was new but I'm old and rusted
So we just hurry up only to wait
And add to the list of all the places we hate
And I'll pretend like I've got something to say but I've got nothing

And now I know what you stole
Yeah you stole
From the cradles they were rocked in
You took the first words that they spoke
Yeah you stole
Yeah you stole
So if I'm a liar then you're a thief
At least we both know where the other one sleeps and lets end this tonight.

Stole
Yeah you stole
From the cradles they were rocked in
You took the first words that they spoke
Yeah you stole
Yeah you stole
So if I'm a liar then you're a thief
At least we both know where the other one sleeps and lets end this tonight



Feel the fire
Burning inside us all.
Remove me
For going in unchained.
Blow away for yourself and gather again.
And, listen to the conversations of the sea.
Inside us all
There's a quiet beach.
If we fall into ourselves we will become free.
I myself could use a little clarity.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.

I am so full of you.
I am so full of me.
I am so full of these words
That don't tell her a fucking thing.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.

Then I opened up my mouth.
I'm a cloud.
And these words they seldom come out.
When I looked into her eyes I cared enough to wonder why
She'd want a cloud that's *floating around.

But I feel it's time to say goodbye to fear.
And feel the fury of these tears
As they run down my face
I can feel her so far away.

'Cause I am a cloud.
And I am so afraid.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.

So don't you come and gather at me in this haze.
I sit at home and feel the sun's daze.
I should tell me not to little everyday.
I blow away remaining unfazed.

When I feel the there's something crawling out of me
I'm just a cloud watching the moon rise.

These motherfuckers stepped on me,
Tried to fuck me from behiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind!

'Cause I am a cloud.
And I am so afraid.

And I... I am.
So... full of love.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.

I am so full of you.
I am so full of me.
I am so full of these words
That don't tell her a fucking thing.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.

I am... so full of love.
Love!

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of love.
I am so full of...



Cause his bride's a different color 
And this is not acceptable 
His papa taught him so 

It was love that he'd been preaching 
But this was overreaching 
The boundaries stretchin' further 
Than his heart would choose to go 

Like an angel with no wings 
Like a kingdom with no king 

What have we become? 
A self indulgent people
What have we become? 
Tell me where are the righteous ones? 
What have we become? 
In a world degenerating 
What have we become? 

Speak your mind, look out for yourself 
The answer to it all is a life of wealth 
Grab all you can cause you live just once 
You got the right to do whatever you want 
Don't worry about others or where you came from 
It ain't what you were, it's what you have become 

Mom and Dad are fightin' 
As Rosie lies there crying 
For once again she's overheard 
Regrets of their mistake 

With Christmas bells a-ringing 
Little Rosie'd leave them grievin'
The gift she'd give her family 
Would be the pills she'd take 

An inconvenient child 
She wasn't worth their while 

What have we become? 
A self indulgent people
What have we become? 
Tell me where are the righteous ones? 
What have we become? 
In a world degenerating 
What have we become?

Speak your mind, look out for yourself 
The answer to it all is a life of wealth 
Grab all you can cause you live just once 
You got the right to do whatever you want 
Don't worry about others or where you came from 
It ain't what you were, it's what you have become

Don't worry about others or where you came from 
It ain't what you were, it's what you have become 

What about love? 
What about God? 
What about holiness? 
What about mercy, compassion and selflessness?

You know it's true 
He is there for me and you 
Doesn't matter what you do

What have we become? 
A self indulgent people
What have we become? 
Tell me where are the righteous ones? 
What have we become? 
In a world degenerating

What have we become? 
Have we come undone? 
What have we become? 
Have we come undone? 
What have we become? 

Selfish... ??? 
With selfish... ??? 
Selfish people 
When you gonna learn? 
Everyone of us 
Gathered 'round in trust 
What have we become?



la la la, la la
hiding all the rattles in the bed
la la la, la la
come crawling in
with bulging eyes
now I can see
there's a bad moon on the rise

raking all the gravels from the tracks
la la la, la la
forget about the daggers in the backs
la la la, la la
scream cross the lawn
with fire in her hair
millionaires come tumbling
down the stairs

a big wind spitting female
rain and teeth
la la la, la la
the dark wolves fell upon me
wools and fleece
la la la, la la
come crawling in
with bulging eyes
now I can see
there's a bad moon on the rise



Please, forgive me for questioning divinity - it's an ugly job but I think I'm up for it. I'm not saying who's right, I'm just saying there's more than one way to skin a religion. There's more than one way to explain our existence.

Reverend Sir, I don't want to seem irreverent, my teenage angst is far behind me. But Father, certainly it's troubling to see all these people kneeling instead of dealing with the fact that we're all we have. So rise up, rise up, there's no one to worship - but plenty of life to lose. I'm not saying, "Let's burn down the churches!" but do you want to hear my confession? It's my greatest sin... here it is

I WASTED HALF MY LIFE ON THE THOUGHT THAT I'D LIVE FOREVER.

I wasn't raised to seize the day, but to work and worship 'cause he that liveth and believeth supposedly never dies. Rise up, rise up, live a full life - 'cause when it's over it's done. So, rise up, rise up, dance and scream and love.



So she stole her momma's lipstick
And she knew that I was coming
And I think that I know why

She goes by Fiona
She seeks bad luck in omens
When she's free and when she's lonely
She comes beatin' at my door, singing:

I've seen the future and the future's nothing new
Just another day to miss the things we used to do
So just lay me down somewhere like you do
I've seen the future and the future's nothing new

Steer the bitch back, paint the crane
Winter's coming back again
Hide the bourbon, clean the stove
Stack the wood in rows below

Sunday's coming, heat the plates
The farmer's daughter lays in wait
Jeans cut off above her knees
Lying there she waits for me

She goes by Fiona
She seeks bad luck in omens
When she's free and when she's lonely

She comes beating at my door, singing:

I've seen the future and the future's nothing new
Just another day to miss the things we used to do
So just lay me down somewhere like you do
I've seen the future and the future's nothing new

Well everybody's pushing paper
Learning how to lose a buck
And all the crystal balls in Portland
Gonna tell you how it's tough
You need a little bit of loving
Just trying to get the good rush
But if you really saw it coming
Would it matter all that much, saying

I've seen the future and the future's nothing new
Just another day to miss the things we used to do
So just lay me down somewhere like you do
I've seen the future and the future's nothing new

Well she don't have her momma's hips yet
So she stole her momma's lipstick
And she knew that I was coming
And I think that I know why



Move your smile across the floor
Tip your hat, the night is perfection
It's a funky music number
Who could ask for more?

Oh, me and m'lady was down in the city
Our feet stuck in concrete and our heads in the fog
I must have been crazy, sure ain't no pity
Well, the dogs there live like people
And the people like dogs

Oh, they're jumpin' up north
They're truckin' in the Delta
Standin' in Manhattan and L.A.'s got the blues
C'mon, shake that fat in every direction
When you're startin' foolish, you got nothin' to lose



Momma can't get down those halls fast enough to see
Glass is sprayed across the floor from the broken window
She can't breathe anymore, can't deny what we know


They're gonna find you, just believe

You're not a person; you're a disease

All these lives that you've been takin'
Deep inside, my heart is breakin'
Broken homes from separation
Don't you know it's violation?

It's so wrong, but you'll see
Never gonna let you take my world from me
The world outside these walls may know you're breathin'
But you ain't comin' in
But you ain't comin' in

Posters hung on building walls of missin' faces
Months go by without the cause, the clues, or traces


They're gonna find you, just believe

You're not a person; you're a disease

All these lives that you've been takin'
Deep inside, my heart is breakin'
Broken homes from separation
Don't you know it's violation?

It's so wrong, but you'll see
Never gonna let you take my world from me
The world outside these walls may know you're breathin'
But you ain't comin' in

Shed the light on all the ones who never thought they would become
A father, mother asking why this world can be so cold

Doesn't come down when she calls, "It's time for breakfast"
The memories begin to fall, she asks, "When will I be free?"

All these lives that you've been takin'
Deep inside, my heart is breakin'
Broken homes from separation
Don't you know it's violation?

It's so wrong, but you'll see
Never gonna let you take my world from me
The world outside these walls may know you're breathin'
But you ain't comin' in

All these lives that you've been takin'
Deep inside, my heart is breakin' 
All these lives that you've been takin'
Deep inside, my heart is breakin' 
All these lives that you've been takin'
Deep inside, my heart is breakin' 

The world outside these walls may know you're breathin'

The world outside these walls may know you're breathin'
But you ain't comin' in



with the hand that's holding your heart
It's more than I am
more than I am

Hold your hand above your head
wiser hands are heard above your heart
It's more than I am
to be more than I am

And you and I are both away
Oh, you and I we are walls away
and we will never say nothing but
what we say
and we will never say nothing but
what we say

Didn't you know that this world
is not meant to be dreamt in
But what hurts me most
is all the time that we've wasted
I've wasted all the dreams in my head
I'll have to move
out of this country instead
I'll have to move
I'll have to move
I'll have to move
out of this country instead

You and I are both away
Oh, you and I we are walls away
and we will never say nothing but
what we say
and we will never say nothing but
what we say
and we say



Drowned impressions falsely made
A cold stare makes light of this
Size me up, make sure that it fits

And I'll be so nonchalant
You can call me, call if you want
I know you've thought of this
Down the hammer, case dismissed

Guilty's the sun whose shadow's in doubt
The argument's weak, the jury's still out
I won't say anything
But write it in the sky
Mother of pearl

We took a photograph
You looked upset, so I tore it in half
You screamed I wasn't fair
The picture was proof that you didn't care

And I'll see you get ahead
Writing the words that I should have said
Death to the one accused
Goodbyes were written, none of them used

Guilty's the sun whose shadow's in doubt
The argument's weak, the jury's still out
I won't say anything
Just write it in the sky
Mother of pearl
Guilty's the sun who swallows in doubt
The testament's weak, the jury's still out
He won't say anything
Just write it in the sky
Mother of pearl

A cruel death, a perfect defense
I slept through the work
But the cover made sense

Guilty's the one who's always in doubt
The argument's weak, the jury's still out
I won't say anything
But write it in the sky
Mother of pearl
Guilty's the sun whose shadow's in doubt
The argument's weak, the jury's still out
I won't say anything
But write it in the sky
Mother of pearl

Guilt is the one thing we could do without
Judgement, the anvil, it's weighting us down
We could do anything
We write it in the sky
Mother of pearl.



Snow covered highway makes it so hard to see the road I'm driving
Sometimes it seems impossible to focus on anything other than you
Right now the world seems so silent because I'd rather think of you
You make me feel like I can do anything, everything
You are the wind in my sail, baby
You're everything I need, you're my love and understanding
6 AM 1.35; the sun rising from the horizon
Colors shoot across the sky, the road is silent


Oh all of this that I wanted, to watch the snow fall down with you
The road is silent, now I'm headed home to you
You are the wind in my sail, baby
You're everything I need, you're my love and understanding
You are the wind in my sail, baby, you know you are
You're everything I need, you're my love and understanding
You make me feel like I can do anything
You make me feel like I can do anything, my love
Make me feel



The one thing that you know you'll never touch
Like the feeling, the real thing
I reach out for that sweet dream

But somehow the darkness wakes me up
I've felt this emptiness before
But all the times that I've been broken
I still run around back for more

You'd think that I'd learn my lesson by now
You'd think that I'd somehow figure out
That if you strike the match
You're bound to feel the flame
You think that I'd learn the cost of love
Paid that price long enough
But still I drive myself right through the pain
Yeah, well it turns out, I haven't learned a thing

Sometimes I think I'm better off
To turn out the lights and close up shop
And give up the longing, believing in belonging
Just hold down my head and take the loss

You'd think that I'd learn my lesson by now
You'd think that I'd somehow figure out
That if you strike the match
You're bound to feel the flame
You think that I'd learn the cost of love
Paid that price long enough
But still I drive myself right through the pain
Yeah, well it turns out, I haven't learned a thing



I didn't choose You, You chose me first
Even when I turned my back
You still gave Your love

It's the only thing I wanna have
No greater gift than
The man to lay down His life
How could I miss this,
I'm not about to pass it up

Count me in
I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord
Count me in
I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord

I'm looking at these plans you have
For me, they're plans of hope and peace
Much bigger than the ones I had
I tried to follow mine, I was going nowhere fast
Your love makes me like a David with a stone and sling
Nothing else could bring my life so much meaning

Count me in
I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord
Count me in
I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord

I can't believe it
I can't believe it
I can't believe it

Count me in
Count me in
Count me in
You can count me in



And I'm losing everything I never thought I would.
Where is that old playground.
Where is that old sundown, when I would come home late an hour or two.
These are the days when we will see all our yesterdays are memories.
The tides will rise.
The winds will turn.
And we are drowning and growing from the burn.
The red October leaves hold on to barren trees.
And frailty is where we became so strong.
Where is that old gun fight.
Where is that old twilight, when fire flies were on the run.



At this second chance
Broken down romance
The gun that's in your heart is in your hand
I know
That you suffocate
And there's hell to pay
And there's hell to pay

Open you're heart 
Let me sleep inside you
Will you still be right here
Still be right here
Waiting around
If I could
Walk you through this ocean
Would you still be right here
Still be right here
Waiting around

Last shot
At this motorcade
Underground crusade
Of love
Of hate
Of fear 
Of foolish games
I know 
that you elevate
There's hell to pay
And there's hell to pay

Open you're heart 
Let me sleep inside you
Will you still be right here
Still be right here
Waiting around


If I could
Walk you through this ocean
Would you still be right here
Still be right here
Waiting around
Waiting around
Waiting around
Waiting around

When times have been so tough
But you know you can't run away
You know that this time we stay
You know that this time we stay
It's now or never

Open your heart 
Let me sleep inside you 
Will you still
Will you still
Be waiting around
If I could
Walk you through this ocean
Would you still be right here
Still be right here
Waiting around

Open you're heart 
Let me sleep inside you
Will you still be right here
Still be right here
Waiting around
If I could
Walk you through this ocean
Would you still be right here
Still be right here
Waiting around



But that's not the way it used to be
Because there was a time that I was without you
Before I said that I believe

Ooh I need a savior
Ooh I need a savior

I want to give this up
I want to hold you hand
Take away this fear that's like an ocean in my head
I want to tell you now, What I couldn't say before
You are everything that I was always looking for

So take me where you want me
Take me 'cause I want to be yours

I've got pride that I still have to break
It's keeping me away from you
And you stay patient while I make mistakes
I'm learning how to trust in you

Ooh always a savior
Ooooh

I want to give this up
I want to hold you hand
Take away this fear that's like an ocean in my head

I want to tell you now, What I couldn't say before
You are everything that I was always looking for

So take me where you want me
Take me 'cause I want to be yours

In the good and the bad times
Ooooh
It don't really matter
I want to know you

I want to give this up
I want to hold your hand
Take away this fear that's like an ocean in my head
I want to tell you now, What I couldn't say before
You are everything that I was always looking for

I want to give this up
I want to hold you hand
Take away this fear that's like an ocean in my head
I want to tell you now, What I couldn't say before
You are everything that I was always looking for

So take me where you want me
Take me 'cause I want to be yours



Maybe only then
Really, I'll try to get right with myself

But I'll grope down that ladder again
'Til I'm tumbling
But really, I just want to slide
I want to crash-land

While my friend, my associate
He's a regal man
Bindles and he twists and ties
Gives the reckoning

Then it's back on the road again
With maybe thirteen grand
Moralize all you might like
I don't believe in it

You've never earned your soul
I know
You've never earned your soul
I know
You've never earned your soul
I know
But I'm gonna try
Oh

I'm a rich young sophisticate
I've got girls and friends
I'm doing what I really like and getting paid for it

There is no key, there's no plan
Well I discovered that
And truly I don't think you'll find a happier man

You've never earned your soul
I know
You've never earned your soul
I know
You've never earned your soul
I know
But I'm gonna try
Oh
I'm gonna try

You float up high and it isn't a sin
And there isn't a hell where we'll be sent
There's only now
There isn't then
So just breathe it in



We don't want love we just want to be touched. Some just touch while others want love. Relationships are way too much, don't give me your heart because I've had enough. 

It's hopeful to know you are there for me, as a friend with benefits, or a friend in need. Love is happiness and happiness is free. It's a lie that we're told and try to believe. God is love and Love is the Devil. What is your type, you say I've got several... It's a great time to be alive. 

There's a hole in my soul that will never complete, just waiting for someone to marry me. Broken hearts are overrated, you died alone because you've waited. It's a great time to be alive and alone.



All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Or the sound you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me

Ooh girl let's take it slow
So as for you well you know where to go
I want to take my love
And hate you 'til the end

It's not like you to turn away
From all the bullshit I can't take
It's not like me to walk away

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Or the sound you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me

Yeah

I know when it's getting rough
All the times we spend
When we try to make this love
Something better than
Just making love again

It's not like you to turn away
All the bullshit I can't take
Just when I think I can walk away

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Or the sound you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything

I'm so addicted to
The things you do
When you're going down on me

Or the sound you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me
Yeah
When you're loving me

How can I make it through
All the things you do
There's just got to be
More to you and me

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Or the sound you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
It's unlike anything

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me

Or the sound you make with every breath
You take it's unlike anything
I'm so addicted to you
Addicted to you







Did anybody notice
While we were busy talking trash
It slipped out of our reach
Nothing
Is anything without it
It's funny how we all forget to
Practice what we preach

We let it go
Tragedy
We should have known
It might leave

Love is on the run
Under the gun
Before it gets away we got a chance to save it
From hiding in the dark
Dying for a heart
Gotta let it be contagious
There's something in the blood
Taking over us
Until we embrace
His beautiful grace
Love is on the run

We've taken it for granted
He's given us a good thing and we're
Letting it escape
Stop
We're heading for disaster
Living like it never really matters
Has to change

We let it go
Tragedy
Left alone
It had to leave

Looking for someone
To use it in the way
The way that it was made
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't throw it away



I would not care to say
For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway?
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us?
Such a long long way behind us?
Who knows when, now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Oh, hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way

Did we leave our way behind us?
Such a long long way behind us?
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long long way
Such a long long way
Such a long long way
Such a long long away
I'm looking for
Still looking for that day



Every place I go, she is on my mind
I would give the world, my soul, to discover
Send me just a sign, angel on my mind

And if I should dream, I could dream of no other
Out here in the deep, hear my body cryin'
Heaven knows the fire that I hide and recover
Glorify this fool, angel on my mind, on my mind, oh

This is the greatest gift that I can bring to you
I, I feel the world that moves inside
This is the moment I have dreamt of all my life
Reach out and touch and you will find

Why am I crazy? Who is foolin' with the order?
I am strong, I will not fade, I will survive, oh
Look in my eyes, you'll see my heart, I will recover
Send me just a sign, angel on my mind, on my mind

This is the greatest gift that I can bring to you
I, I feel the world that moves inside
This is the moment I have dreamt of all my life
Reach out and touch, oh, and you will find

This is the greatest gift, ooh
This is the greatest gift, oh
Hey yeah, hey yeah Oh,

This is the greatest gift that I can bring to you
I, I feel the world that moves inside
Oh, this is the moment I have dreamt of all my life
Reach out and touch, and you, you, you

This is the greatest gift that I can bring to you
And I, I feel the world that moves inside me
Ah, this is the moment I have dreamt of all my life

This is the greatest gift that I can bring to you
Oh, this is all my life, oh
This is the greatest gift, this is the greatest gift, oh
Reach out, reach out, oh reach out



Most days, I'm burning in a fire, I got a cliche cold staring at my world
These days the bird is on the wire
Two fingers pull a pen, a half drawn picture of a dream
And here between the writing on the wall, I try to feel forgotten for a while
And it's hard, and I get angry all the time
But this is not a life I cannot change

But somewhere in the heart of the aftermath
There's an answer for me
'Cause you could have been anybody on the road to me

And you said, this time you needed answers
No time for second chances that we wasted long before
And I said, you only see the problems
You're too afraid to solve and so I headed for the door
And here between the writing on the wall, I try to feel forgotten for a while
And it's hard, to see the shadow in a man
He is the last to see the light before it hits him where he stands

But somewhere in the heart of the aftermath
There's an answer for me
'Cause you could have been anybody on the road for me
And all this time, your head is numb
And maybe I don't know
But somewhere in the heart of the aftermath
There's an answer for me
'Cause you could have been anybody on the road that I know

presumed dead
unsolved child murder

since they dragged the lake

You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you
Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town
I turn my back and you're messin' around
I'm not really jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown
I think of you ev'ry night and day
You took my heart then you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh

Daylight, spent the night without you
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through
Hey, man, bet you can treat me right
You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see you begging, say forget it just for spite
I think of you ev'ry night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Huh

I think of you ev'ry night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away

As sweet a young child as you'd find 
Her parents had gone to their final reward 
Leaving their baby behind 

Did you hear this poor little child 
Was only nine years of age 
When mother and dad went away 
Still she bravely worked 
At the one thing she knew 
To earn a few pennies a day 

She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear 
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Fashioned from Annie's despair 

With papers and shears, with wire and wax 
She made up each tulip and mum 
As snow flakes drifted in to her tenement room 
Her baby little fingers grew numb 

From artificial flowers, those artificial flowers 
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear 
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Made from Annie's despair 

And they found little Annie all covered with ice 
Still clutching her poor frozen shears 
Amidst all the blossoms, she had fashioned by hand 
And watered with all her young tears 

There must be a Heaven where little Annie can play 
In heavenly gardens and bowers 
And instead of halo, she'll wear round her head 
A garland of genuine flowers 

No more artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Flowers for ladies of society to wear 
Those artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Fashioned from Annie's 
Fashioned from Annie's despair



Am I a bad soul?
My eyes roll backward
My head fell forward
We want the vampires
They want the daylight
Undecided if we will feel it

All the lies and fantasies I picked to deny what is right
as the lawyers lie down to the sound of a broken man clinging
to the legs of a butterfly.
We live to see our children die,
turn to the bright to describe what we never will find,
I'm a monster singing through the side of a left eye

And I will pay for, and I will pay for,
I couldn't have her,I couldn't save her,
If I could grab on, I'd pull the ......

All the lies and fantasies I picked to deny what is right
as the lawyers lie down to the sound of a broken man clinging
to the legs of a butterfly, of a butterfly
We live to see our children die,
turn to the light to describe what we never will find,
I'm a vampire clinging to the sounds for a fast high.

All the lies and fantasies I picked to describe what is right
as the lawyers lie down to the sound of a broken man clinging
to the legs of a butterfly.
I live to see our children die,
turn to the bright to describe what we never will find,
I'm a monster singing through the sigh of a left high.



Alone on a winter's night 
I'm drunk as a racehorse 
But I'll never fade outta sight 

There's a wild below me 
A wild up there in the stars 
There's a history behind me 
A child gone cold in my arms 

Tell George and Tammy 
I'm ripe for the taking these days 
It's a good year for roses 
And a bad year for runnin' in place 

But if they don't believe me 
I'll do what I always have done 
I won't be the sundowner 
No I'll never cheat on the sun 

'Cause when the sun comes up 
And the moon is gone 
To the bridge I go 
To the bridge I run 

And when I reach the edge 
Onto the bridge I crawl 
And when I find you my friend 
From the bridge I fall 

This is the last place 
That I've ever been, ever been 
It's the last best place 
That I've ever been, ever been 

And in spite of my weakness 
And all my desires to win 
I won't be the sundowner 
Tomorrow I'll leave here again 

'Cause when the sun comes up 
And I need a friend 
To the bridge I run 
When I need a friend 

And when I meet the edge 
Onto the bridge I crawl 
And when I find you my friend 
It's from the bridge I fall



Have you got the time to let me say hello,
I couldn't help but see,
That you look like a lady I used to know,
A long time ago - Ohh. 

Remember the time we spent together,
Remember the days that went forever,
Remember the nights we stayed together,
Whatever I do I'll still remember.

It's hard to believe,
That I held her up and then she let me down,
It's all the same to me,
But she broke my heart and left me,
Spinnin' 'round and 'round and 'round - Ohh. 

Remember the time we spent together,
Remember the days that went forever,
Remember the nights we stayed together,
Whatever I do I'll still remember - Ohh!

Remember the time we spent together,
Remember the days that went forever,
Remember the nights we stayed together,
Ahh, together,
Whatever I do I'll still remember.

Remember the time we spent together,
Remember the days that went forever,
Remember the nights we stayed together,
Do you remember,
Whatever I do I'll still remember.



Although you may not ever believe that it's so
I've been taken to looking back
Across it all, it was never that bad
Oh you know

For the minute a pretty face
In the mirror, to take my place
To submit to the ... race
I'm going to see to your immediate needs
Love's for idiots, so leave me alone on my liberties
My liberties

For twenty days or more
I've been staring a hole in the wall
So this business is what I left you for
We were never that bad together at all

For the slightest little change
I will stitch it up and rearrange it
When I feel more than a little strange
Get someone else to do the thinking please
Love's for idiots, so leave me alone on my liberties
My liberties

I'm really on your side
And I would never ever try and hurt you again no no
Take my blessings where ever you go
And if there's someone else to who you wish to go
I just dont want to know

You're none of my business now
I do forget it sometimes
I dont know how
I get too weary and I get too loud

I always knew there would be times like these
Love's for idiots, so leave me alone on my liberties
Leave me alone, my liberties
My liberties



And all those days we spent out by the lake
Has it all gone to waste, all the promises we made
One by one they vanish just the same

Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain
In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end

Now it all seems so clear, there's nothing left to fear
So we made our way by finding what was real
Now the days are so long that summer's moving on
We reach for something that's already gone

Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain
In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end

We knew we had to leave this town
But we never knew when and we never knew how
We would end up here the way we are
Yeah we knew we had to leave this town
But we never knew when and we never know how

Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain
In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end



Barefoot and homeless in Rio De Janiero
Sleepin' on the step of a church
Whose doors are locked
Livin' in a cardboard box
Inside at the shrine
The Priest sips fine wine
Dines on fine food and looks for a sing
No mother no father
No shoes nor a bed
No place to relax and rest his weary head
Where his next meal will come from
Nobody knows
But everyone can see the church is covered in gold

Wish I had a home
With ten million rooms
I'd open up the doors
And let the street children through
Wish that I could scoop
All of those children in my arms
And give the love they need
And to protect them all from harm

Wish I had a home
With ten million rooms
I'd open up the doors
And let the street children through
Wish that I could scoop
All of those children in my arms
And give the love they need
And to protect them all from harm

Wish I had a home
With ten million rooms
I'd open up the doors
And let the street children through
Wish that I could scoop
All of those children in my arms
And give the love they need
And to protect them all from harm



So maybe it's time to say goodbye, 
Not gonna look around 
I'm just gonna look away.
Don't put the reasons back in my head, 
You say you loved me now you've left me for dead, 
Oh I just can't stand it this way.
Oh jealousy, coming over me, 
It's that jealousy, breaking my heart.
Whoa jealousy, taking control of me, 
Now ya just gotta know, 
That I can't let it go, 
And it's time that ya knew, 
I can't stop loving you.

You say I'm a sentimental fool,
But all I tried to do is go with you, 
Not gonna look around 
I'm just gonna look away.
It's been a battle since you broke my heart,
I tell you now that it's been coming down hard, 
Oh I just can't stand another day.



I'm at my best when I con barely start
I fall down easy but I get up slow
I really, really hope that the bruises don't show

Cut mysetf and I tasted my blood
Dragged my name right through the mud
I fall down easy but I get up slow
I really, really hope that the bruises don't show

If I came to you late at night
Would you answer to my call
I can't do anything to make it all right
This is how you learn to fall

Cracked my skull and I hit the floor
I don't want to talk about it any more
I fall down easy but I get up slow
I really, really hope that the bruises don't show



Coming up slowly
And many more seem to be opening their eyes
Coming up slowly
Centuries of twisted truth and lies
Coming up slowly
Many people many places sick and tired
Coming up slowly

Hey! Mr. you see I've seen this, before
And I don't believe you, this time
You see I've opened, my eyes

You're keeping secrets, from me
You're keeping secrets, from me
You're keeping secrets, each day
You're keeping secrets
Keep you satisfied, satisfied

Many people on a mission to unite
Coming up slowly
Many people spreading message far and wide
Coming up slowly
Every message has a universal tie
Coming up slowly
Every message for the fate of the unborn child
Coming up slowly

Hey! Mr. you see I've seen this, before
And I don't believe you, this time
You see I've opened, my eyes

You're keeping secrets, from me

You're keeping secrets, each day
You're keeping secrets 
To keep you satisfied, satisfied

The sea calls to me
I hide in the water
But l need to breathe

You are an ocean wave, my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave, my love
If only I could find out the way
To sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away

I've been run aground
So sad for a sailor
I felt safe and sound
But needed the danger

You are an ocean wave, my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave, my love
If only I would find out the way
To sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away

You are an ocean wave, my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave, my love
If only I would find out the way
To sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away

Stow away
Stow away



Yeah the weak and the poor struggle to claim my uncaring mind
These woes of mortal men, these worthless things of the world
Well I don't care and I won't pretend 'cause tonight I'm mad at a girl

Every stranger's face seems like it holds more than it reveals
Every street I pace sparkles with gold, but that's not how it feels
I stand on the river's rim, but I'm not searching for pearls
Just finding a hole as deep as I'm in, 'cause tonight I'm mad at a girl

No, I don't need a close friend's ear, that gut spilling stuff is for squares
And I never go around mirrors, I don't wanna see someone that cares

I've gone miles dodging the blame, torn these soles apart
I've raked my nails over the name that I wear on my heart
And I've swallowed pride enough to make my stomach curl
Yeah tomorrow I'll be begging for love, but tonight I'm mad at a girl

Come right on in, make yourself at home
Pull up a road and so
Keep them footsteps comin' Joe
As a traffic jam strikes up a drone
We'll sing the only song we only know

About how we've loved, and how we fell
And how we'll spend our days 'till hell
Just walking slow

We will never walk together
That place has gone right out of style
It's been a long while
And young and clever
Laughing around so easily
Well that's OK
They'll be here some day

Welcome to the walk alone
Our spoils were worth our weight in stones
Pull up a road but no
And I have thoughts that I own
Keep them that way and leave mine alone
And we'll be just fine
Keeps the place alive



The depths I wish I could have known.
Dangerous, black and full of spite.
Thoughts of you fill my nights.
But now we lay naked on the floor
I'm lost, I'm drowning in your soul
I was searching for some answer in your eye
I find malicious laughter
And a love that has died.

You are haunting my reality
Your lies are the only truth that I believe
You are haunting my reality
Now everytime I think about you I die

Passion runs through me marrow deep
I long to tear your eyes out in your sleep
This passion, can lead to evil crimes.
Do I kill you or do I choose to die?
Acid burn etched through my brain
Will someone die before I go insane?
I was searching for some answer in your eye
I find malicious laughter
And a love that has died.

You are haunting my reality
Your lies are the only truth that I believe
You are haunting my reality
Now everytime I think about you I die

Lies repeat

Soon now - you'll be gone
I wish to God I could have known.
I love you, I hate you every night.
This longing for your soul has got me scared
But now we lay naked on the floor
I'm lost, I'm drowning in your soul
I was searching for some answer in your eyes
I find malicious laughter, hate
And lies, fucking lies!

You are haunting my reality
Your lies are the only truth that I believe
You are haunting my reality
Now everytime I think about you I die repeat



You can see she's crying out 
She hides behind her smile 
You can see the pain of doubt 
And if you would hold her close 
You could feel the brokenness inside 
You would know she feels alone 
She feels empty 

She needs more then a hug on a holiday 
She needs more then a smile on a Sunday 
She's not looking for you to fix what's wrong 
She really wants to know, really wants to know she belongs 
She needs more then a love song 

Listen to her now 
Broken is a beautiful sound 
She's a little scared 
She's afraid of falling further down 
But maybe if you let her know 
And gave her just a little hope 
Somehow if she knew the truth she'd 
come alive 

In the end 
We will learn 
Actions speak louder then our words



Standing on the corner trying to hail a cab 
You tap me on the shoulder 
My heart about to stop it was fine 
You ask me for directions you was going my way 
I had no objections I couldn't be blasé 
You were fine 

The move was so electric 
You were so magnetic 
Just like in the movies 
Just like in the movies 

Thursday at the Plaza, Friday at the Ritz 
You were all I wanted and we seal it with a kiss 
You were mine 

I felt your arms around me I was so secure 
I knew that love had found me I knew it couldn't go 
You were mine 

We look so fine together 
Love will last forever 
Just like in the movies 
Just like in the movies 

Get yourself together 
Love to last forever 
Just like in the movies 
Just like in the movies 

I just found a picture dusty on the shelf 
Gazing at the mirror smiling to myself 
I'm alive 

If is but a moment 
Wonder where it all went 
Just like in the movies 
Just like in the movies 

If is but a moment 
Wonder where it all went 
Just like in the movies 
Just like in the movies 

Just like in the movies 
Just like in the movies 
Just like in the movies



She lost her mind between the battle lines.
And the telephone rings. A bell rung out
As they talk about 16 kids gone in a school yard.
The papers read, she shakes her head.

And I said in the darkest night,
Come the darkest days. In the worst of ways.

Close that town for good, the plagues here.
The skin from beneath all the way to the mouths that feed.
Then they're filtered clear, the boys will try.
In the judge's eye.  Get out while you can, 
She tells me you're wasting time. That's fine.

In the darkest night
Come the darkest days, in the worst of ways.

From the silent cry, to the naked eye,
She waves goodbye.

Holding up the bank in Belgrade
I played a tune, when, how, did it happen soon?
She said now we find a way to make it down
The place smokes and the palace burns
And the world keeps turning around, and around yeah.
Around, and it's bringing me down.

In the darkest night,
Come the darkest days.
And the last bell rings out.



That you, you first stayed over at mine 
And we drank our first bottle of wine 
And we cried 

Line two, we're away 
And we both, we both had nowhere to stay 
Well, the bus shelter's always OK 
When you're young 

Now you're older and I look at your face 
Every wrinkle is so easy to place 
And I only write them down just in case 
That you die 

Let's take a look at these crow's feet, just look 
Sitting on the prettiest eyes 
60 25th of Decembers 
59 4th of Julys 
Not through the age or the failure, children 
Not through the hate or despise 
Take a good look at these crow's feet 
Sitting on the prettiest eyes 

Line three I forget 
But I think, I think it was our first ever bet 
And the horse we backed was short of a leg 
Never mind 

Line four in a park 
And the things, the things that people do in the dark 
I could hear the faintest beat of your heart 
Then we did 

Now you're older and I look at your face 
Every wrinkle is so easy to place 
And I only write them down just in case 
You should die 

Lets take a look at these crow's feet, just look 
Sitting on the prettiest eyes 
60 25th of Decembers 
59 4th of Julys 
You can't have too many good times, children 
You can't have too many lines 
Take a good look at these crow's feet 
Sitting on the prettiest eyes 

Well, my eyes look like a map of the town 
And my teeth are either yellow or they're brown 
But you'll never hear the crack of a frown 
When you are here 
You'll never hear the crack 
Of a frown
Of a frown
Of a frown
Of a frown



And I am filled with worry
With every morning comes
Uncharted territory
Am I too young and restless
To live the way the fearless do?

I think it's time I start to 
Live
Unafraid of tomorrow
Live
Knowing You're in control
Live
This life wasn't made to waste away
I wanna live

Take my concerns and cares
Give me new revival
I may be breathing air
But You're my soul survival
I wanna know the freedom
That can only come from You

I'm so tired of waiting
There's no more time to lose
So give me strength to move
To live



And I know it won't be long
I hope I see you out tonight
And I hope we get it on

'Cause I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, let's go

Whatever you heard about me before
Believe me things ain't what they were
Whenever you look at me or talk to me
You still sound just like her

And I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready

Seldom seen and in between
And I know it won't be long
Bittersweet is evergreen
Until we get it on

Now I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready

I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready

I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready



Welcome to Britain in the third Millenium
This is the diary of a Macedonian, Macedonian

He went to Britain in the back of a lorry
"Don't worry, don't worry, don't hurry."
Said the man with the plan
He said, "If you really wanna go - you'll get there in the end."
If you really wanna go - alive or dead my friend
Well, you can levitate you know - long as the money's good you're in
Or if you really wanna go - you'll get there in the end

He had the wooly scarf of Shaktar Donetsk
Nay, the banner of freedom wrung around his neck
Inherited from his father
One of the Ukraine exiles of Yugoslavia
He said, "You'll get there in the end."
If you really wanna go - alive or dead my friend
Well, you can levitate you know - long as the money's good you're in
Or if you really wanna go - you'll get there in the end

Yo-oh, he got a little postcard
Yo-oh, everybody got a dream
Yo-oh, he always got it with him
Yo-oh, it's of a nineteen twenty five
Red telephone box with Wembley in the background
Them twin tower vandal-aye

Will he find a two bar heater
Waiting for him in two rooms
Above the cut rate telephone anywhere place
He got off the train in Shadwell, disappeared without trace
He said, "You'll get there in the end."
If you really wanna go - alive or dead my friend
Well, you can levitate you know
long as the money's good you're in
Or if you really wanna go - you'll get there in the end

Oiling the grinding city underside
Treating each flake of rust all over Humberside
You know a blocked generator could cut power to the city system
Well - you'll get there in the end
Alive or dead my friend
You'll get there in the end
Alive or dead my friend
If you really wanna go - you'll get there in the end
If you really wanna go - alive or dead my friend
If you really wanna go - you'll get there in the end
If you really wanna go - alive or dead my friend
If you really wanna go - you'll get there in the end
If you really wanna go - alive or dead my friend
If you really wanna go - long as the money's good you're in
If you really wanna go - you'll get there in the end



She isn't always funny in the night
Once she gets a couple drinks in, she's probably gonna tell you you ain't doing anything right
Then you'll roll your eyes and then you'll probably fight

She mainly trades in adoration
She gets pretty wasted at the celebrations
The benefits and the building dedications

It's always sunny in the morning
It sucks around the ending of the night
When she storms out of the restaurant
I think you're supposed to chase her to the lights

One boy hits her like a tambourine
The other dissing me on her message machine

Magazines and daddy issues
I know you're pretty pissed, I hope you'll still let me kiss you
Magazines and daddy issues
I know you're pretty pissed, I hope you'll still let me kiss you

Magazines and daddy issues
I know you're pretty pissed, I hope you'll still let me kiss you
Magazines and daddy issues
I know you're pretty pissed, I hope you'll still let me kiss you

I hope you'll still let me kiss you

One boy calls while the other texts
She's got boys on board and boys on deck
Second dates and lipstick tissues
New York gets pretty heavy, girl, I hope it doesn't crush you

Magazines and daddy issues
I know you're pretty pissed, I hope you'll still let me kiss you
Second dates and lipstick tissues
New York gets pretty heavy, girl, I hope it doesn't crush you

Magazines and daddy issues
I know you're pretty pissed, I hope you'll still let me kiss you



Walkin' on a fine line
Never seem to buy, enough for you
If you're lookin' for a way out
Then you're headed for the right place
Givin' up is something I can't do

Ooh you got sharp claws
Always got your back up
Venom in your eyes, and blood so blue
Hangin' on a black tie
Sippin' on a half shell
Holdin' all the cards, and a joker too

You should have told me sooner
I would have let you go
Now you're driving me crazy

I can't stand it any longer
When you pay the price for freedom
It ain't wrong girl
I can't stand it any longer

Dancin' on hot coals
Playin' with a live wire
Sneakin' out the back door, you're so cool
If you really wanna move on
Then there's nothing left to say
Here's a ticket for the bus stop
I'm no fool

You should have told me sooner
I would have let you go
Now you're driving me crazy

I can't stand it any longer
When you pay the price for freedom
It ain't wrong girl
I can't stand it any longer



And I don't think about I could ever represent I've been to
I guess it's easy for me and that's the kind of easy that I'm into
Yeah the Xmas sexy ahh said next and said all the little babies
Now go 
Baby gonna let you
I thought that you could set you free
Luxury cars and a sweet guitar
Sleeping at nearling 'cause I'm rocking easy says I catch you

I thought that you could set you free
Oh the Xmas sexy no said next and sex floors and ecstasy
Hot and said next decks on a whole'a baby on a holograph I'm maybe gonna let you
I thought that you could set you free
I thought that you could set you free
Whooooaoao
Aayayayayayayayayay 
Ooohohohohohohoh
Aaaaaaahahayayayaya



I hope you stay in charge of it
When nothing's fluid, you drink yourself through it
Outside, you draw, draw yourself

Feel the breeze
That's a real thing that touches your skin
But memories
Well, they're not real

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

There's nothing there

Now can we visit your old house again?
I feel as though I've left instructions there
Could it be that you were so small that
The garage room, well, they've pulled it down
Oh, nothing's ruined 'cause we still have the picture
Of dog roses and stuff for the pyre

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Oh yeah
Have you always slipped backwards
Just now, I see you always slip backwards
Oh you, will you always slip backwards
Just now, oh you always slip

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

There's nothing there



As a single tear falls from her eye
Another cold day in December
A year from the day she said goodbye

Seems it's only been a moment
Since the angels took him from her arms
And she was left there holding on to their tomorrow
But as they laid him in the ground
Her heart would sing without a sound

For the first time you can open your eyes
And see the world without your sorrow
Where no one knows the pain you left behind
And all the peace you could never find
Is waiting there to hold and keep you
Welcome to the first day of your life
Just open up your eyes

A single lifetime lays behind her
As she draws her final breath
Just beyond the door he'll find her
Taking her hand she softly says

For the first time you can open your eyes
And see the world without your sorrow
Where no one knows the pain you left behind
And all the peace you could never find
Is waiting there to hold and keep you
Welcome to the first day of your life
Just open up your eyes

Just open up your eyes as I lay you down tonight
Safe on the other side, no more tears to cry

For the first time you can open your eyes
And see the world without your sorrow
Where no one knows the pain you left behind
And all the peace you could never find
Is waiting there to hold and keep you
Welcome to the first day of your life
Just open up your eyes



Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law?
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

You know that every day a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by

Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created?



As part of a process that holds you back
A walk along an avenue of trees is just what you need
But the memory of divorce lingers on

Everything will never be OK
Everything will never be OK
There'll always be some part of you in pain
Everything will never be OK

There's a lack of oxygen inside this town
Stops my brain from getting me high
Every time I wake up it's a brand new day
And I realize my body's designed to die

Everything will never be OK
Everything will never be OK
There'll always be some part of you in pain
Everything will never be OK

You can take an hour or two out of every day
Living in a world of lies, you feel no pain
'Cause I'm waiting for the day when I don't have to work
And love will satisfy my impatience
You know how much, my dear, that I would love to talk
But I'm far too busy on this occasion

Everything will never be OK
Everything will never be OK
There'll always be some part of you in pain
Everything will never be OK

You can take an hour or two out of every day
Living in a world of music, you feel no pain
It's just as real, it's just as real
It's just as real to escape as to suffer

Everything will never be OK
Everything will never be OK
There'll always be some part of you in pain
Everything will never be OK

Everything will never be OK
Everything will never be OK
There'll always be some part of you in pain
Everything will never be OK



You tend to choose the slide
And they never seem to warn you
The slide's your final ride
And when you're at the top of it
And you cannot see the end
Either don't let go son - Or grab the nearest friend
The slide is no respecter of dignity or class
As soon as you sit down on it
That slide has got your ass

Don't take the slide, don't take the slide
Heroes and villains have tried and cried
A broken soul at the bottom lies denied
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide

When the slide was invented
A thousand drinkers sighed
They thought they had the copyright
On the very word the slide
It's a picture of innocence
On which the innocent have fried
Take the helter skelter son
It's easier than the slide
Advice to listening parents
Or the father of the bride
Let them marry anyone
But don't let her take the slide

Don't take the slide, don't take the slide
Heroes and villains have tried and cried
A broken soul at the bottom lies denied
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide

It'll take you much much lower
Than you ever would have asked
'Cause as soon as you sit down on it
The slide has got your ass - It's customers are fools
And every one of them deceased
The long and silver murderer
The devil must have greased

Don't take the slide, don't take the slide
Heroes and villains have tried and cried
A pile of broken souls at the bottom it denied
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide

Don't take the slide, don't take the slide
Heroes and villains have tried and cried
A broken soul at the bottom it denied
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide



Or fake your deaths; your wounds undressed beneath your costumes.
Some are so well rehearsed
For hearses it hurts, always the first to wave the white flag
And barricade themselves
In false pretenses, fox holed in trenches.
Forged casualties with casual pleas,
Dying to please the enemy
We die to stay alive, we kill to survive

We are the corps of corpses,
We are up in arms and armed
Bring all the king's horses and all the king's men

Push on, plod on, these legs like pistons pumping forward motion.
Convalescent men in uniform.
We have fallen to friendly fire, shrapnel freckles our spine.
Still our feet fall one by one.

We are the corps of corpses,
We are up in arms and armed
Bring all the king's horses and all the king's men

We were led to lead lovers, while marching to the beat.
We were led to lead lovers, we kissed so well.

The cannon's calling our name,
I hear her singing to me
In morse code,
"This is our revolution!
To arms! To arms!
This is a revolution!"

We are the corps of corpses,
We are up in arms and armed.



If you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on

You treated me just good enough until now
But if you're tired of me I'll get over you somehow
Oh, if you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on

If you don't need me there's someone else who needs me out there
She's kind and tender and one day I'll find her I swear
So set me free while I've still got time
Don't try to hide your shame, dear, from my eyes
Oh, if you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on

Faded love
As if you need a reason
Am I out of your dreams
Or just out of season
Oh the flame of love
Oh you wouldn't understand
You hide it in your heart
You don't hold it in your hand

If you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on
If you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on

My suits got creases and my shoes have got shine
Let me know soon I'll find a better use for my time
Oh if you don't want me
If you don't want me
Oh, if you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on
I'll dry my tears and move on
I'll dry my tears and move on



You sunset diving bird
You're cool wind set upon the branches of a tree
You're holding my attention
You are my first impression
And I can recognise the light that I've been given

One day they will discover you
Low cloud moving across the sky
One day they will uncover you
Young girl
Wash the sleet out of your eye

Dust on my piano
Wool rest never sleeping
All your best one-liners borrowed from a film
The thing that gets to me is
How you're never free, and
How the spirit yearns
Your body is a prison

One day they will discover you
Low cloud moving across the sky
One day they will uncover you

The thing that gets to me
Is how you're never free
And how the spirit yearns
Your body is a prison

Bright as her eyes
Wide in the night
Why can't you see me?
Come with the wind
Time to begin
There'll be no compromise
When all you want is wrapped around you
As those saints preserve us when we're dying
To pick us up from where we're lying
One day they will discover you
One day they will uncover you
Bright as her eyes
Wide in the night
They will discover you
They will discover you



I'm sick of sinkin' man I'm on my knees
Tell me again just why you lied to me
It's separation anxiety 
Where did I go wrong?
Is what I'm feeling
Some kinda love song
To stop the bleedin'
Get on the right track
We'll never make it back
You go the wrong way
You're goin' my way
All the things I said to you are over now
And I just can't get over you 

Since you've been gone I fall apart
I knew you'd leave me from the very start
Tell me again just what you want from me
It's separation anxiety



Open road and I'm ready to roll
Put the pedal down right away
Redline and I'm given it more

City lights are burning bright behind me woah
Top down, I push it to the floor woah, woah
Street signs and the centerlines spinning woah, woah
Running hot, I feel like I'm ready to roll

Taking off like a jet plane
High speeds and she's ready to go
Fuel burning like a freight train
Redline and I'm given it more

City lights are burning bright behind me woah
Top down, I push it to the floor woah, woah
Street signs and the centerlines spinning woah, woah
Running hot, I feel like I'm ready to roll

Give me room to run
One more road I'm on
Give me room to run away
I feel like I'm ready to roll

Fast lane through a hurricane
Top down on the highway
Taking off like a jet plane
Redline and I'm given it more

woah, woah
Street signs and the centerlines spinning woah, woah
Running hot, I feel like I'm ready to roll

Give me room to run
One more road I'm on
Give me room to run away
I feel like I'm ready to roll

So that I could look respectable for you
And it's time that I built myself a refuge
So that I could hide away if I so choose

These days it feels that everything is changing
Used to be that every stride, you were standing by my side
But now it feels I'm walking on a tightrope
As I try to balance out how to make you proud

One day I'll be perfect, I'll be so extraordinary

I will shine, I will radiate

One day I'll be perfect, I'll be so extraordinary

I will take your breath away
And you almost don't even recognize me
Saying, "How did you erase all but gorgeous from your face?"
But don't be scared 'cause I'll live here forever
Won't you take a venture out, won't you take a venture out of there.

One day I'll be perfect….

The stars will fall from skies above
But I am no prophet of doom
I just thought I'd warn you
It's a service I provide for free to you
They call it love, babe.

One day I'll be perfect….



In a world of glass and paper doubt
The doc explains in th ebest way he knows how
That the cancer found its way in through out mouths

Wake form your sleep
Oh, precious one
Wake up now
I can hear her breathe
She's coming back to me
And when she speaks
Can we live with what we've done
She's moving and I am terrified that we can't hear the whisper

If I make it to morning and somehow believe
It was fear that turned our dreams to doubt
Her cancer I ate for her father who waits
Cause she wants to sing again

Wake form your sleep
Oh, precious one
Wake up now
I can hear her breathe
She's coming back to me
And when she speaks
Can we live with what we've done
She's moving and I am terrified that we can't hear the whisper

What kind of son would I be if I let her sleep
What kind of brother would I be if I let her sleep
She's gonna speak



Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
That defines the meaning of their lives

You are mine

There are objects of affection
That can mesmerize the soul
There is always one addiction
That just can not be controlled

You are mine

Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
They hold high their prized possession

You are mine



I like your big decisions
But I love the way you change your mind
I like your strength of vision
But I love the way that love is blind
I like that you've got bigger balls that almost all of
The Special Forces
And I need you leaving me like UFO's need horses

So into you

I like when you've got opinions
But I love that you never take a side
I like that you ain't into millions
But I love that you expect me to provide

I like the way you make me feel
And if this ain't real, then I ain't breathing
And I love that you've given me exactly what
I was needing

So into you

I like your calm dependence
And I like your way with patience
I like your understanding
But I love what you're demanding
I like your taste in outfits
But I love your taste in misfits
And I know that when the shit fits
The toughest teeth grit: 'Cos this is it

So into you



So far from where I intended to go

Scavenging through life's very constant lulls
So far from where I'm determined to go

Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way

Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love
But you see, I've got no charm

Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold
Oh, this is very clear to you

And you can tell I have never really loved
You can tell by the way I sleep all day

And all of my life no one gave me anything
No one has ever given me anything

My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye
You must be such a fool to pass me by



And it's on once again for young and old
Because you stole the farmboy's time
Cuz if you find me on the trippy hip hop
Like I said before you whore
We got the drop on you you're through
So don't try and copy
The style of those you chose to propose because you're sloppy
There's a noise at the front door
And just last week you sounded just like Faith No More

Suckers come and go
you won't fight it you won't know,
There's some things you'll never know

You've bought a new record kid
Now you've got a new style
Let me tell you right now
You're like a senile pedophile
Cuz you wanna rape the kids but they won't pay you shit
Because you cut your hair when it was time to leave
OH fingertip main trip, think you're so down and I just can't take it
Suckers like you who fake it through, you're through
Make me wanna be sick and you're sliding up and down
HIP HOP'S TIP!


Come and rock the party full swing
Listen to the styles that I bring and you know that kid
you can't rock the party, FOOL
If it's for the radio
Just how many times I pulled the grand theft audio?

Got to people, feel they tried to sound like you
when there were dreams to kill, if I had a pound
everytime I saw a sucker, I'd be a rich man mother fucker




Cause his bride's a different color 
And this is not acceptable 
His papa taught him so 

It was love that he'd been preaching 
But this was overreaching 
The boundaries stretchin' further 
Than his heart would choose to go 

Like an angel with no wings 
Like a kingdom with no king 

What have we become? 
A self indulgent people
What have we become? 
Tell me where are the righteous ones? 
What have we become? 
In a world degenerating 
What have we become? 

Speak your mind, look out for yourself 
The answer to it all is a life of wealth 
Grab all you can cause you live just once 
You got the right to do whatever you want 
Don't worry about others or where you came from 
It ain't what you were, it's what you have become 

Mom and Dad are fightin' 
As Rosie lies there crying 
For once again she's overheard 
Regrets of their mistake 

With Christmas bells a-ringing 
Little Rosie'd leave them grievin'
The gift she'd give her family 
Would be the pills she'd take 

An inconvenient child 
She wasn't worth their while 

What have we become? 
A self indulgent people
What have we become? 
Tell me where are the righteous ones? 
What have we become? 
In a world degenerating 
What have we become?

Speak your mind, look out for yourself 
The answer to it all is a life of wealth 
Grab all you can cause you live just once 
You got the right to do whatever you want 
Don't worry about others or where you came from 
It ain't what you were, it's what you have become

Don't worry about others or where you came from 
It ain't what you were, it's what you have become 

What about love? 
What about God? 
What about holiness? 
What about mercy, compassion and selflessness?

You know it's true 
He is there for me and you 
Doesn't matter what you do

What have we become? 
A self indulgent people
What have we become? 
Tell me where are the righteous ones? 
What have we become? 
In a world degenerating

What have we become? 
Have we come undone? 
What have we become? 
Have we come undone? 
What have we become? 

Selfish... ??? 
With selfish... ??? 
Selfish people 
When you gonna learn? 
Everyone of us 
Gathered 'round in trust 
What have we become?



It seems the times of our lives have all come and gone, but we know better.
We've just begun.
We are, we are, the kids in the way.
You can't hold us down, oh no, you can't hold us down.
This world it tells us what to do.
It tells us who to be.
They think their answers to this life will satisfy our needs.
We are so different.
We are another breed.
There's nothing you can do or say, to make us choose another way.
There's nothing you can do or say, to make us go away.



I feel a cold wind blowin', my future looks black
You left me here and you've taken all my yesterdays
I guess to stand alone is the price that I pay
Now look what you've done to me
Because we just disagree
I'm out here alone and it's you that I'm waiting for

Can't go livin' without you, girl
It doesn't matter what you say or do, girl
Can't go livin' without you, girl
Isolation

I close my eyes and you're dancin' in the moonlight with me
I try to touch you, but you, you had to get free
I turned around and you're nowhere left in sight
I'm just a lone survivor, you know it ain't right
Now look what you've done to me
Because we just disagree
I'm out here alone and it's you that I'm waiting for

Can't go livin' without you, girl
You know that I'll be waiting here for you, girl
Can't go livin' without you, girl
Isolation

I remember holding you just yesterday
But you're memory is all that I have today
We were talking 'bout promises we once had made
But you never came back
Why'd you run away
You ran away

Can't go livin' without you, girl
It doesn't matter what you say or do
Can't go livin' without you, girl
Isolation
Girl, I'm so isolated
Can't go livin' without you, girl, oh
Girl, you know I'm gonna wait for you
Can't go livin' without you, girl
Isolation



with a cabinet full of mushrooms 
and a cooler full of beer

It was spring time in the mountains
when we headed out of town
the peaks were white, the sky was blue 
and the sun was beatin' down

We were rollin' down the highway 
just havin' a little fun 
you sure can drink a lot of beer 
underneath that Texas sun

So I pulled into a liquor store 
and that's where the trouble all began 
'cause I ran into their awning 
and we had a run-in with The Man


Get me out of this smalltime Texas town
'cause I don't wanna be stuck in jail when the sun goes down
you can't bust me if you don't know what you found

I tried to talk to the girl inside
I even offered her some cash
but she wouldn't listen, she just called the cops
'cause her gutter had been smashed

And the next thing I knew when I walked outside
there were police all around
askin' who was drivin' the vehicle, can I see your license
whatcha doin' in our town



We were sittin' on the steps of the liquor store
just tryin' not to look too scared
they were searchin' the RV and I was thinkin'
sometimes life just isn't fair

Well, they opened up that cabinet
and they found our little stash
but they didn't know what it was and let us go
minus eighty bucks in cash




Get me out of this smalltime Texas town
I'll be runnin' as soon as my feet hit the ground
you can't bust me 'cause you don't know what you found



We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when,
But I know we'll meet again, some sunny day.
Keep smiling through, just like you always do,
'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away. 

So will you please say hello to the folks that I know,
Tell them I won't be long.
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go,
I was singing this song. 

We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when,
But I know we'll meet again, some sunny day.

So will you please say hello to the folks that I know,
Tell them I won't be long.
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go,
I was singing this song. 

Keep smiling through, just like you always do,
'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away





They've got you movin' to the city
Oh my, you think you're lookin' pretty
But they've got their pistols too
Tucked down beneath their shoe

It's a new sensation
World annihilation
Moving to the music
Patiently it's waiting
The city's screaming
I can hear them breathing
Crying out for wisdom
Hungry minds are feeding

And I know that you're tired of this
'Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
A true soul said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side

Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Are you scared?

They've got you marching to a drum beat
Oh, my, you got another nose bleed
They'll keep you so amused
You'll never taste the truth
It's a new creation
Total domination
Chains across your shoulders
Social captivation
Kill our leaders
Persecute our teachers
Criticize our culture
Crucify free thinkers

I know that you're tired of this
'Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
A true soul said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side

Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Are you!?



Fill our eyes with money
Vanity that's cunning
Only on the surface
Diamonds look so stunning
Mass deception
Altered our perception
Sold it to the children
Made a new connection

And I know that you're tired of this
'Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
A true soul said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side







Sashays into the room
All the boys, they catch their breath
And the mirrors swoon
Now she's running down the hall
Head scarf and a Hollywood smile
She's got a dagger in your back
And a killing style

Love and hate, it's all the same your way
Just another twisted game to play

Evil, child star, movie queen
Evil, sweet charm, Mabeline
Evil, no one gets the better of me

Your father's rage and a cocktail dress
With a bullet proof heart
Why is your life in such a mess
If you're so damn smart
Judy Garland, Jimmy Dean
You tragedy queen
Give me fat girls, give me rough boys
Give me what I dream

Love and hate, it's all the same your way
Just another twisted game to play

Evil, child star, movie queen
Evil, sweet charm, Mabeline
Evil,such a pretty boy that I've never seen

Love and hate, it's all the same your way
Just another twisted game to play

Evil, child star, movie queen
Evil, the sweet charm, Mabeline
Evil,noone gets the better of me

Evil
Evil
Evil
noone gets the better
noone gets the better
noone gets the better



You say that there's nobody else
But you re looking into
The eyes of a fool

You say what you wanna say
And I'll sit here hoping it's true

But you re looking into the eyes of a fool

And when you say you really need me
You know I'll come running
You know I'll come running to you

And though you can't look into my eyes
And say what you're thinking
I go on believing in you



You left my soul mourning, there's nothing I can do.
My life was offered as a sacrifice, you took the blade,
Cut out the heart, removed my soul, so nothing could be saved.

Life with all its madness is like a carnival,
You ride the horses, play the games, release the inner child.
But when it comes to games of chance, you lose before you begin.
When others make the rules of life, you'll find you'll never win.

A gambling man enjoys the thrill of losing everything,
I've lost much more than gold alone could ever buy again.

Sweet thief of reason, I thought you were my destiny,
The future looked much brighter when you were near to me.
How quickly dreams can crumble beneath the cold of light,
I wish that I could slumber all through the endless night.

I lie awake, the pain of light destroys my reverie,
My skin grows colder day by day, ‘til you come back to me.
A gambling man enjoys the thrill of losing everything,
I've lost much more than gold alone could ever buy again.

You left my senses calling,
I'm empty without you.
You left my soul mourning,
There's nothing I can do.



On fire work it out,
On the river to the morning, now.

Free is all you gotta be
Dream dreams no one else can see
Sometimes ya wanna run away
But ya never know what might be comin' round your way
Ya ya ya

On a day like today
The whole world could change
The sun's gonna shine
Shine thru the rain
On a day like today
Ya never wanna see the sun go down
Ya never wanna see the sun go down

Somewhere - there's a place for you
I know that you believe it too
Sometimes if you wanna get away
All ya gotta know is what we got is here to stay
All the way

On a day like today - the whole world could change
The sun's gonna shine - shine through the rain
On a day like today - no one complains
Free to be pure - free to be sane
On a day like today
Ya never wanna see the sun go down
Ya never wanna see the sun go down

Free is all we gotta be
Dream dreams no one else can see
But ya never know what might be comin' for you and me
Ya it's gonna be

On a day like today

Oh, learn to be a day like today.
To came to live and happily ever after.



You came in time, I came around
He's running late with the fella's down town
You need a reason like a prayer
He's never here, he's never there

I'm going home with you
I'm going home with you

Eleven-thirty everytime
Two buttons loose now you realize
I see the eyes that your momma gave you
I see the mess that your daddy made you

I'm going home with you
I'm going home with you

I see you in your blood-shot dress
I steal you from your love-shot mess
I see you holding on
And all your love is gone

I'm going home with you
I'm going home with you

She's had enough west-19
On hand and foot, and bending knees
These awful bets are broken words
He's out of time and you say to me

I'm going home with you
I'm going home with you

I see you in your blood-shot dress
I steal you from your love-shot mess
I see you holding on
And all your love is gone
I'm going home with you
I'm going home with you

I see you holding on
And all your love is gone
I'm going home with you
I'm going home with you
I'm going home with you



Been around with nothing to do
Can't you see I need you
Gotta get crooken for the night is through
Rock 'n' roll in your soul
Can't you feel it when the drums start to pow
Let it go then you'll know
Feels so good when you're moving around

Let it all out
Get out your chair, shake it in the air, let it all out
Get it outside, you'll be satisfied, let it all out
You'll feel better when you let it flow, let it flow

Go to town, mess around
It's okay, I'm gonna moving
Kick your feet, feel the beat
Every night and every day
Rock 'n' roll in your soul
Can't you feel it when the drums start to pow
Let it go then you'll know
Feels so good when you're moving around

Let it all out
Get out your chair, shake it in the air, let it all out
Get it outside, you'll be satisfied, let it all out
You'll feel better when you let it flow, let it flow

Feels so good when you're moving around

Get it outside, you'll be satisfied, let it all out
You'll feel better when you let it flow, let it all out
Get out your chair, shake it in the air, let it all out
Get it outside, you'll be satisfied, let it all out
You'll feel better when you let it flow, let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow



One of these nights
Your gaze of compassion
Just a little too right
Your hug of encouragement
A little too tight
ANd then he'll know
It's the little things betray
You're going to give yourself away
To some Casanova
On the spills and stains
Of a backstage sofa
He'll catch you yawning
With one leg over
And there's the sin
Must be the enemy within

That's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
A slip of the tongue
A squeeze of the hand
That's the way that it shows

There's glycerine in the tear
Rouge in the blush
Your artful stammer
A little too rushed
All passion to the eye
All cold to the touch
And then he'll guess
Your mind has drifted in the kiss
There's a chink in your armour
A crack in your defenses
When your iron will
Gives way to your senses
Your whispered sweet nothings
All sound like expenses
And that's enough
He won't believe your words of love

And that's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
Yes, that's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
It's the - That's the way that it shows
A slip of the tongue
A squeeze of the hand
That's the way that it shows

Your world has got you wrapped around my neck! I can here you leaving, look at the mess you've left behind, I still hear you screaming, I hope you are gone for good this time! 

You have never said goodbye and that's ok with me. This time I have locked the door and thrown away the key. I don't have time for this and less apologies it comes as no surprise that you don't see me! 

Your world has got you wrapped around my neck! I can here you leaving, look at the mess you've left behind, I still hear you screaming, I hope you are gone for good this time! 

This time I have closed the door..... we have been through this before.....You have made your mark on me, it's plain as day too see I treat you carefully but you don't see me. 

Your world has got you wrapped around my neck! I can here you leaving, look at the mess you've left behind, I still hear you screaming, I hope you are gone for good this time!

Baby, baby, come on

So come on, baby, baby, shake your hip
Baby, baby, come on

About the girl whos seen it all
She was seventeen comin up on eighty
Let me tell you from the start
Im gonna try to do my part
But this big old world does nothing but escape me
With parting gifts and childish fits
My rubber soul is made of this
The comfort of my childhood bliss
Have made me cover up the dull inside
Become the apple of an eye
Im gasping at the sight of eyes adoring me



As I recollect my world stopped turning and then I prayed
God wanted me to know
He just took her home

One more angel is up in heaven now, heaven now
One more angel is up there looking down, up there looking down

Take all the time
To tell the ones you love how much you really care
So when they're gone
The first thoughts that come to mind
Aren't things should've shared
Don't let memories go in vain

Then they're just teardrops in the rain

One more angel is up in heaven now, heaven now
One more angel is up there looking down, up there looking down

Time passes by you never get it back
Even if, even if you tried
When yours finally comes have all that love is
On your side
When they remember you
These words will all be true



That makes you want to love me
Is it my body
Or someone I might be
Or something aside me
Tell me
Tell me
It's really up to you
Have you got the time to find out who I really am
Oh, aw

What does it take
To get inside your mind
Give me your brain
And take a change with my first time
Tell me
Tell me
It's really up to you
Have you got the time to find out who I really am
Oooooooooohaaa

What have I got
That makes you want to love me
Is it my body
Or someone I might be
Or something aside me
Tell me
Tell me
It's really up to you
Have you got the time to find out who I really am
Ooooooh,  aaw
Oh, aw, oh, aa, uh, aa, uh, ah, u, uh
Come baby, Alice come'on come'on come'on come baby, come'on



I'm not the same I used to be
I think for myself now
I don't need you in my ear
I'd love to hit you in the face
I'd love to know you've gone away
I don't wanna see you again
I hope you can understand me

Get out of my face
Get out of my sight
Get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
I don't understand why you think you
Can do the things you can't

So get out of my face
Get out of my sight
Get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
My piece of mind

You're so mad 'cause your losing control
You don't know which way is safe to go
Everything is so fake
I don't know what else to say
You'll see somehow some day
Some way you'll see believe me

Get out of my face
Get out of my sight
Get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
I don't understand why you think you
Can do the things you can't

So get out of my face
Get out of my sight
Get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
My piece of mind

Get out of my face
Get out of my sight
Get out of my head

Get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
I don't understand why you think you

My piece of mind

Get out of my face
Get out of my sight
Get out of my head

Bring me back my piece of mind

So get out of my face
Get out of my sight
Get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
My piece of mind



You're so polite
You can't explain
And me, I'm getting sick
I'm sick of it
I call it quits

Because really, falling down is easy
No one else will help me
Won't you carry on dear
Carry on without me

Please just forget my name
Forget my face, you're all the same
The human race
Someone else can take my place
And leave me here
Without a trace

You're left and right
You're rich and poor
You're black and white

And me, I'm barely here
I'm barely there
Not anywhere

Because maybe, everybody's happy
Laughing and ecstatic
Don't forget to carry on without me

Please, forget my name
Forget my face
You're all the same
The human race
Someone else can take my place
And leave me here
Without a trace

So you can sell me
Send me down the river
You'll find someone who's better
Won't you carry on dear
On without me, please

Forget my name
Forget my face
You're all the same
The human race
Someone else can take my place
And leave me here
Without a trace
Without a trace



Cause tomorrow I'll be fine
I should learn to be still
If I close my eyes I'd realize what you meant

Don't wait for the sun
It could turn black any day
I've lost my hat in the clouds
When will this haze go away?
I never wanted this

Now it's all I've got
Someone else is keeping time
I think I'm falling apart
If you were me, would you do it like I do?

Don't wait for the sun
It could turn black any day
I've lost my hat in the clouds
When will this haze go away?
I never wanted this

Don't wait for the sun
It could turn black any day
I've lost my hat in the clouds
When will this haze go away?

So don't wait for the sun
Don't wait for the sun
Don't wait for the sun
Cuz it could turn black any day
You're all that I wanted



Am I just like you?
Mirror, mirror
We look the same but is it true
Mirror, mirror
Sees through idle dreams
Mirror, mirror
It never comes its never been

As all the people gaze
With starry eyes
The mirror reflects
A wish for a disguise
Forecast is set to change
To whats popular these days

Mirror, mirror
Am I just like you?
Mirror, mirror
We look the same but is it true
Mirror, mirror
Sees through idle dreams
Mirror, mirror
It never comes its never been

You're just another clone
In a world that has no shame
In other words
It's you that is to blame

Forecast is set to change
To whats popular these days

Mirror, mirror
Am I just like you?
Mirror, mirror
We look the same but is it true
Mirror, mirror
Sees through idle dreams
Mirror, mirror
It never comes its never been



That I never really meant to stay
I left you right where I want you
Now there's nothin' left
And not a reason
There's nothin' left to believe in
When just one remains
I've sailed away

Such a foolish game
That we have been playin'
Now you got me right where you want me
I left you in the right
But you wouldn't let me take the fall
Now you've got me right where you want me

Now there's nothin' left
And that's the reason
There's not much left to believe in
If it's all just the same
I'll sail away
You pushed so hard
You have to know that
You might just get what you wanted
And when just one remains
I've sailed away

I found out on my own
Everything that I've been missin'
Now I've got you right where I want you
Now that we're apart
I see just who you are
You're always gonna be
The one to keep hatin'
Now I've got you right where I want you

Now there's nothin' left
And that's the reason
There's not much left to believe in
If it's all just the same
I'll sail away
You pushed so hard
You have to know that
You might just get what you wanted
And when just one remains
I've sailed away

I'm not one to hide my face behind the pain
It's not like me to beg you to stay
I'll just sail away

Now there's nothin' left
And that's the reason
There's not much left to believe in
If it's all the same
I'll sail away
You pushed so hard
You have to know that
You might just get what you wanted
And when just one remains
You know I've sailed away

And when just one remains
You know I've sailed away

Does it hurt to hear me say
That I never really meant to stay



Everyone I thought I could lean on, Has made me cry.
Everytime I close my eyes there's nothing there.
Feeling empty is all I have left, There's nothing else to bare.

And I realize, that I've lost my mind.
And I realize, that I am the lie.
It's over, my time to shine.
I'm already dead, so why can't I die.

Everything I thought I could see, has disappeared.
Everything I thought I could be, Has been drown by fear.
Somehow it seems all I can do, is sit and stare.
Somehow nothing good seems to last, or was it ever there?

And I realize, that I've lost my mind.
And I realize, that I am the lie.
It's over, my time to shine.
I'm already dead, so why can't I die.

Somehow it seems all I can do, is sit and stare.
Somehow nothing good seems to last...

And I realize, that I've lost my mind.
And I realize, that I am the lie.
It's over, my time to shine.
I'm already dead, so why can't I...

Realize, that I've lost my mind.
I'm already dead, so why can't I die



Like we were prizes
Like we were premium

And the clown paraded us around
So glad to know us
So damned proud of us

And the clown would feed us his food
Cooked like a gourmet
Cooked with affection

And the clown gave us a good home
It was a shelter
It was asylum

And the clown had something go wrong
A mental shut down
A synaptic revolt

And the clown had no idea why
Where were his ethics
Where were his manners

And the clown became a jag off
Full of mad hatred
Full of repugnance

And the clown took back what he had given
Destroyed our trusting
Destroyed his own life

And the clown drew into himself
Stopped interacting
Stopped even living

And now the clown is gone from our lives
Good riddance



Whats the movement if you don't move, what have you got left to prove 
Im not sure how to stick to the floor, I smashed on to your ceiling, let me sleep awhile cos I cannot stand, break my fingers, hold my hand 
What's the movement if you don't move, what have you got left to prove 
And ill write and ill write but nothing here reminds me of you, You left a postlet on your door, saying I don't wanna see you no more, But sir I know your lying, This time ill disappear, into my career, cos nothing in here reminds me of you. 
Dear Sir, quietly slip away, the last leaf fell we all saw it, cos we can see, that you flagging its not just your heels that your dragging, 
Whats the movement if you don't move, what have you got left to prove x2 
And ill write and ill write but nothing here reminds me of you, You left a postlet on your door, I don't wanna see you no more, But sir I know your lying, This time ill disappear, into my career, cos nothing in here reminds me of you



Oh, we had a lot to learn
Cause all along we had our fun
And then it turned
It turned around and
Now we find the love we had
Oh, has slipped away
Oh, sometimes we lose the games we play
What can I say?

Anyway

Oh, build a bridge to bring both sides together
Yeah, build a bridge to bring both sides together
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Well



It's getting harder to read it these days
Are we paranoid?
Or basically okay?

Are the books not adding up?
Is every battle an effort to maintain?
Does the signal fade?
Do you feel afraid?

Has your faith been shattered 'cause you never had a say?
Do those planes keep crashing in the middle of your dreams?
Does your conscience scream a little louder every day?
Is it just fear that keeps you here?

Are we in over our heads?
We're popping pills just to sleep sound at night
The fever holds
Like a lonely parasite

Is the truth not adding up?
Is it getting harder to not criticize?
What we justify
Are you terrified?

Has your faith been shattered 'cause you never had a say?
Do those planes keep crashing in the middle of your dreams?
What I'm really asking here is will you find reasons to stand?
Or is it fear that keeps you here?

Is it just fear that keeps you here?

Is the writing on the wall?
It's getting harder to read it these days
Are we paranoid?
Or basically okay?

Is the truth not adding up?
Is it getting harder to not criticize?
What we justify
Are you terrified?

Has your faith been shattered 'cause you never had a say?
Do those planes keep crashing in the middle of your dreams?
What I'm really asking here is will you find reasons to stand?
Or is it fear that keeps us here?

Is it just fear that keeps us here?
Is it just fear that keeps us here?



So desperately trying to amuse
It's hard to get any bearing
Thank god it's interrupted by the news
Protection is recommended
If you want to avoid insanity
Unicorn your days are over
Frequency modulation vanity

Feel your ears bleeding, cut the waves or you die
Feel your ears bleeding, turn the knob, say good-bye
Feel your ears bleeding, cut the waves. Do or die

Every day is another torment
Keep reaching for the switch but it's to far
Can't stand the torture much longer, 
from every house and inside every car
Resist any temptation 
to yourself be coned into a smile
Indifference, easy solution
Don't even think about to reconcile.



Dwelling on microcosmic lane
Outside the cosmic play unfolds
Indifferent to the truth that you hold

Screamin' in the streets with fists held high

Wavin' your flag in the air
Metal and leather and hair
Do you want to know if I even care?

When all the answers are made clear
Silence is all mankind will hear

Marchin' in the streets with arrogant pride

Wavin' your flag in the air
Rainbows and leather and flair
Do you want to know if I even care?
Wavin' your flag in the air
Civilization beware
Do you want to know if I even care?

I don't care.

Wavin' your flag in the air
Anger, rebellion, dispair
Do you want to know if I even care?

I don't care.



Maybe you can't see,
I'm getting tired, I'm wasted,
I'll panic on,

Hearts are sick and blind,
Yeah well you don't even know,
All you gotta do, just stop and ask me,
Silver chrome and steam,
Set the tone and send me out,
It's everything you want,
Complete the failure,

No more to say,
What about today, what's really going on,
And between the blinds, of bloodshot eyes,
I thought I'd see my way, see my way,

Hearts are sick and blind,
Yeah well you don't even know,
All you gotta do, just stop and ask me,
Silver chrome and steam,
Set the tone and send me out,
It's everything you want,
Complete the failure,

Yeah you're getting awfully close,
Yeah you're getting awfully close,

Hearts are sick and blind,
Yeah well you don't even know,
All you gotta do, just stop and ask me,
Silver chrome and steam,
Set the tone and send me out,
It's everything you want,
Complete the failure,
Complete the failure,
Complete the failure.



Oh my, what a dazzling display
Of talent, that's what they say
Would you believe it?
My goodness, HEY

Take a look around
I'm so impressed
Of everything they do
Do it again and again, alright
I can't believe my eyes
It's unbelievable
In the middle of the show
They make the fluids flow
Take it away

Du geile Sau

Oh my, what a dazzling display
Oh my, what a dazzling display
Of assholes, that's what I say
Would you believe it?
My goodness HEY

Look around
Oh, so impressed
Of all the things they do
Do it again and again, alright
I can't believe my eyes
It's unbelievable
Give me what I know
Make the fluids flow
That's what I know
Come on, let's go
And make the fluids flow

Can you smell it?
It's stinking yellow

Oi Oi Oi

I'm so impressed... TALENT!



the summer is over
I'm going through changes
I see you again

It's so thought provoking
emotion evoking
I can't turn around
I don't want to pretend

You stand in my way
with nothing to say
you think you're the world
I'm so lost without you
I'm sorry my friend
this is not the end
I'll do it without you
I'll do it again

You stand in my way
with nothing to say
you think you're the world
I'm so lost without you
I'm sorry my friend
this is not the end
I'll do it without you
I'll do it again
I'll do it again

October, October
the summer is over
I'm moving in circles
I'm trying to come in

It's my evolution
the only solution
the torment it's all that
I'm holding within

You stand in my way
you've nothing to say
you think you're the world
I'm so lost without you
I'm sorry my friend
this is not the end
I'll do it without you
I'll do it again

You stand in my way

with nothing to say
and think you're the world
I'm so lost without you
I'm sorry my friend
this is not the end
I'll do it without you
I'll do it again

Don't stand in my way
with nothing to say
and think you're the world
I'm so lost without you
I'm sorry my friend
this is not the end
I'll do it without you
I'll do it again
I'll do it.



And just like that river I've been running ever since
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
Cos I don't know what's out there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will

I go to the movie
And i go down town
Somebody keep telling me don't hang around
Its been along time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will

Then I go to see my brother
And I say help me please
And he winds up knockin' me
Back down on my knees

There were times when I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gone come, oh yes it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
Cos I don't know what's out there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will



They say every distance in not near
Yet I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my life come shining from the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall

I see my life come shining from the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now I shall be released

They say there'll be a new enquiry
They say there's been a slight mistake
But while they write reports,we've heard it all before
Let's get him out before it's all too late

Now yonder there's a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
Ten long years he's been there shouting so loud
Just crying out that he was framed

I see my life come shining from the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now I shall be released



Faith takes chances and faith moves mountains
You will see what you don't see, faith prevails where belief fails
It needs no proof, baby you don't need proof

You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay, yeah, yeah, yeah
You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay, yeah, yeah, yeah

You claim to be searching but just want to be down without a fight
No one seeks God, no, not one
God will be, though belief fails and love prevails where passion fails
No one seeks God, no, not one

You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay, yeah, yeah, yeah
You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay, yeah, yeah, yeah

Our nature plays with fire burning bridges that made us stronger
Don't play it safe, fall in love with an honest conviction
Our nature plays with fire burning bridges
Don't play it safe, fall in love with an honest conviction

You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay, yeah, yeah, yeah
You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay, yeah, yeah, yeah



Its 3am and I'm awake
Imagine the light
Upon her blue transparanet face
True coloured glass
It filters down to warm the street
Faded

I'm the one who leads your mind
See my life in your design
True companion at your side

Gracious and good
When all around is turning bad
Restless and rave
When laid upon suburban grass
Your timing is right
Remove the sad persistent thought
Hold the cause

Well I'm the one who reads your mind
See my life in your design
True companion at your side

I'll give you something
When I'm not around
To make you smile
Outside that wasteland
And if only I can make it through
If you think it then it must be true

I'll be wherever you are
Wherever you are



what cha gonna do?
will you tell a story - when he asks you where the hell
you've been
or will you tell the truth?

i ain't holdin' back - i know where i stand

life

I'm left without, without a thought thought!
A bullet hole, you made no mark mark!
I guess I'll never see you standing there again

Say something
Say something
Say something
Say something
Say something
Say something
You're just standing still!

La da, la da da da da!

This gummy hole is all I've got got!
I'm left without, without a thought thought!
A bullet hole, without a shot shot!
I guess I'll never see you standing there again

Say something
Say something
Say something
Say something
Say something
Say something
You're just standing still!
We are standing still, we are, we x8



books that we've been told to
Are we catching the meaning?
Are we really supposed to?

It's time that we start seeing 
the shades of color between the lines
Find a true way of being 
Don't you think we're wasting time

Have you heard of Douglas town?

And the Irish of another skin

A million people have died there 
how come we never heard a thing?

You envision a world without chains

Listen do you hear the call?
Dr. King and those who rise and fall
Fought so hard to bring peace to all


Can't you see
that not everything is black and white? 
Can't you see,
that we need each other's strength and might?
In this world of illusion 
it's so easy to be blinded
out of created confusion
separation in minded

See if we can believe in 
the truth that all our children know 
It's about time we start thinking
it's not all about what we're told 

Can't you see
that not everything is black and white? 
Can't you feel
that we need each other's strength and might? 
When we believe
that there's no need for these walls to grow 
We'll all see
that it takes all colors to make this rainbow 

Higher, higher, higher....and so on



And his face, his face is long
And while he's peeking out
Through his hair he hides the pain
Till that Lennon song comes along
He'll turn it off and say can you drive?
Jimmy, we need to borrow this for a minute
Cause we need to escape
Now there's so many things that
He's gonna do in 5 lifetimes
Hell I could do 'em all
Yeah and while he's rolling his own smokes
He says to me he's buying a new ride today
A classic deal the boss will give
He said the same thing two weeks ago
You've seen that sweaty jet rag
Feeling come over him, and I've
Seen that boy nod into a dream a time or two
And on his way out his glazed stare
Will make you stop and wonder
Hey William is that the last time
I'm gonna look at you?
But the next day phone will ring
And it will be him
Can you drive?
Jimmy, what would you say
what would you do
Oh should I pray?
Or do you think that this blind mind
would listen to me, anyway



Be careful, sugar, of who you call a friend
'Cause they'll get you in the end

Step easy, baby, and don't you cry
She had another brother on the side
You could not let it slide

And if, my love, I said I’m sorry
Would you believe me? Should I cry?
Then hold me as I die

And the ones who live are the ones who fly
And the ones who crawl come crawling by and by
On back to you again

But I ain't never going to see you again
And I’m never going to feel you again
So let this moment never ever end

And if, my love, I said I’m sorry
Would you believe me? Should I cry?
Then hold me as I die, as I die

And if, my love, I said I’m sorry
Would you believe me? Should I cry?
Then hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me as I die



The religion I have lost in recovery
In recovery
And what you need from me isn't playing a guitar
Or sympathy
It's my honest heart
In pursuit of yours

How long should I wait for words to come
I may have done us in for good
Which vow will I break before I'm done
God, I may have done us in for good

I may have done us in for good
Honestly, I have made a few mistakes
But I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean
And with recovery
I replace a broken vow and a growing seed with my honest heart

How long should I wait for words to come
I may have done us in for good
Which vow will I break before I'm done
God, I may have done us in for good
I may have done us in for good

Just pay attention to every thought
Pay attention to every thought
We pray for revival
I let go, I let go
All I want is your forgiveness
Say you'll stay

How long should I wait for words to come
I may have done us in for good
Which vow will I break before I'm done
God, I may have done us in for good
I may have done us in for good



Don't you think it's time we put it to bed
Let me out of my own
well in my car at night i go it alone

Back and forth and up and down
I wanna walk away and not make a sound
Take a dive just like that
I've seen it happen at the drop of a hat

And I've got my answer, right or wrong
You can't kill me I'm too strong
Who we gonna blame today
Well let's point some fingers right away

Sit at home, connecting dots
The sort that only exist in your thoughts
Don't you dare listen in
I don't come around here asking where you have been

All your i-spy my tongue?
Your idea of fun
You can take it anywhere
That you want now

And I've got my answer, right or wrong
It can't kill me I'm too strong
Who we gonna blame today
Well let's point some fingers right away

And I've got my answer...
And I've got my answer, right or wrong
It can't kill me I'm too strong
Who we gonna blame today
Well let's point some fingers right away
Right away
Right away



It's fucked up when I can't
It's fucked up when I wanna be there
It's fucked up when I can't
It's fucked up when I wanna fix it
It's fucked up when I can't
It's fucked up when I wanna have it
It's fucked up when I can't

I don't seem to be there anywhere around

It's fucked up when I wanna have it
It's fucked up when I can't
It's fucked up when I wanna get it
It's fucked up when I can't







you know i'll feel better
and when you sit there all alone
it's over

last call i'm gone
did you think you could lie forever
i've known for so long
still you tried to play the pretender
you always acted so suprised
you knew it, you knew it
and now i see through your disguise
see through it

and when you wake up on your own
you know i'll feel better
and now you sit there on your own
you know, you know that it's over

it's close, your fault
did you think you could be so clever
your lies no more
did you think you could do much better
you always acted so suprised
you knew it, you knew it
and now i see through your disguise
see through it

and when you wake up on your own
you know i'll feel better
and now you sit there all alone
you know, you know that it's over

you lied to me and tried to fit
inside the arms of another
don't cry to me 'cus when it hits
you'll know, you'll know that it's over

whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa

you always acted so suprised
you knew it, you knew it
and now i see through your disguise
see through it

and when you wake up on your own
you know i'll feel better
and now you sit there all alone
you know, you know that it's over

you lied to me and tried to fit
inside the arms of another
don't cry to me 'cus when it hits
you'll know, you'll know that it's over
it's over



I don't want you thinkin' that I shed too many tears
I never felt the need to cry for all the wonderin' why
I don't think love can ever feel that way again

I searched this whole town 'round for a whisper of your name
I don't need you thinkin' that you got the best of me
And it doesn't shame me that I spent a lot of time
Wonderin' if love can ever feel that way again


I wouldn't bet you're thinkin' 'bout me now
But that's all the same to me 'cause I don't think that much of you
Since those couple nights I spent alone,
Sitting home waiting for you to call
And you never called at all

The reason why I'm singin' this ain't that you done me wrong
It's not because I'm worried, I've left all that stuff behind
It's just I find it funny how you chose to treat a friend



A friend of ours has seen you and he said you're lookin' fine
He was talking 'bout your beauty and I was asking 'bout your mind
Besides it's not your face I find a-missin' in the end
I don't think love can ever feel that way again
I don't think love can ever feel that way again



High above the tide
Underneath the waves
Where I can come inside

A reveille
Told in fractured time
Only in this way
Will I become alive

Fill me with your love
I’m standing by
You and you alone
Don't ask me why
There's an inner place
I cannot find

So S.O.L. 
And petrified
So every time
You blow your mind

I wait for you
You never come
You're bleeding through
I must be numb

And you are just a dream
I cannot find
From under what you see
Don't ask me why

Don't leave it alone
My love, my wreckage
I ain't too weak to run
Though slow, I’m coming

Once I count the numbers down
To the end or there around
Free or thus, forever bound
For forever's coming down
And finally

Fill me with your love
I'm by your side
You and you alone
Don't ask me why

For you I will be there
I just can't hide
From way beyond the glare
I'll tell you why

Don't leave it alone
My love, my wreckage
I ain't too weak to run
Though slow, I’m coming



Sucking cock in East Africa
Ask a lesbian for a fuck
Take a shower in... Auschwitz

And it's gonna happen to you

Complaining about a drug deal at Jolly's pub
Driving really fast in a car
Scuba diving in a hippies tub
Take a shower in... Auschwitz

And it's gonna happen to you, baby
It could happen to your child
You could have the same experience

We got plenty of where 
Those came from 
With your mechanical flattery 
You're trying to blind me 

Willing and able 
Those people got 
Caught up with the devil 
And then they go 
Searching for the lord 

Attitude gratitude 

Look into my eyes  
Like a boxer 
You anticipate  
I radiate a certain cool 

Remember the days 
We spent on 
The brink of finding 
Something new 
In our backyard 

Attitude gratitude







Can't stop the fun from raging 
Oh 'cause we're in too deep 
Can't take a whip and tame it 
Oh is the price too steep 

I want to make you happy 
Won't give myself away 
Want me to fake it baby 
It's just a game we play 

You want in, I want out 
That's what love is all about 
Full of hope and full of doubt 
You want in and baby I want out 
You want in and I want out 

I've got a heart in danger 
Oh 'cause I'm stuck on you 
I wish we could start again as strangers 
Oh don't know what to do 
Don't want to start no trouble 
Don't want to go away 
Wait too long and the pain is double 
They were the ones that paid 

You want in, I want out 
That's what love is all about 
Full of hope and full of doubt 
You want in and baby I want out 
You want in and I want out 

Why do you do it to me

I want to make you happy 
Won't give myself away 
Want me to fake it baby 
It's just a game we play 

You want in, I want out 
That's what love is all about 
Full of hope and full of doubt 
You want in and baby I want out 
You want in and I want out



Makin' time to fuss and to worry.
Get your feet back on the ground,
It's no good to live in a hurry.

Take it easy in your mind,
No one wants to get behind.
Think about it, you will find
Time is on your side, slow down.
Can't slow down  

Things around you change so fast,
Livin' day to day is confusin'.
How long will the good times last,
Thinking you're on top when you're losin'?

Take it easy in your mind,
No one wants to get behind.
Think about it, you will find
Time is on your side, slow down.



And don't you do it to me
I wouldn't do it to you And don't you do it to me

The feelings on it as I lie sleeping
With burning desire
Trying to be nice, all in keeping
Lighting up my fire

Oh she's so professional
She's so professional
She's just as cool as ice, and every time she smiles
She is so professional, so professional

She's so professional
Mmm, she takes it cool as ice Every time she smiles,
you know her smiles are nice She needs a confidante,
you tell her you're the one
With the mouth that smiles
And then she has to leave
Never satisfied, as I light up my fire

She is, so professional, so professional

Wouldn't do it to you, so don't you do it to me
Mmm, playing with me like you do, it's okay
Oh, you only want me when you want to, but it's alright
About time I got an answer I'll pay
Now I finally finally lost my reason, tonight

I wouldn't do it to you, so why you do it to me?
I wouldn't do it to you

Paying the price, and love is cheaper
I'm not the only buyer
Sugar and spice a choice of sweetenin'
Tasten' to acquire

Oh she's so professional, so professional
She takes a change of grace, it's just a change of way
She is, she she Mm

Playing with me like you do, it's okay
oh you only want me when you want to, but it's alright
Mm now, mm now, about time I got my answer I pay
Now I finally finally lost my reason, tonight

Mm, I wouldn't do it
You twist me this way and that way, and I don't know
Which way that you want me go
Come on babe what you want me to do
Come on baby don't you be untrue, yeah
Been loving you far too long I don't know where my love has gone
Ain't paying the price no more

Shake for me, shake for me, shake for me, yeah

Shake for me, shake for me, shake for me
Shake for me, shake for me, shake for me, yeah



To try and find a clear way through
Now, it's been a while
Since I asked myself what to do
It's been a while since I played the fool
Cos they said "raise your game, leave the shame
in this place where you will remain
unless you save your soul" 
Now it's going my way
Forget the time that I did then
Now it's going my way
I look and everything's OK
I've got nothing much to say except
The life that I now lead
Is going my way
Going my way

It's been a while since I spent the day
The whole day wrapped up in my dreams
It took a while upstaging misery
It isn't all it seems
Now I smooth my hair, feeling tight
I'm getting into something right
Living beyond those days


I don't understand how it came to
How it came to
I don't understand those depths of despair
Those despairs
I don't understand how it came to
How it came to
I don't understand reaching that despair
Reaching that despair


Cos I've settles my mind 

Settled my mind to fade



Cold run down the length of my back
Whip my heart with a mighty crack
You gave me the closest thing 
To a heart attack

My body shivers my body it shakes
You rock the house with the 
Love that you make
I'm growing weak with 
This intangible ache
But baby keep it coming
For goodness sake

Wash me down with the dirty water
Open the door baby let me come in
If it's a crime to let you under my skin
Lock me up cause I'm as guilty as sin

You got no style you aint
Heard of romance
I'm like a food for even 
Taking a chance
You got me flying 
By the seat of my pants

But come on baby, I wanna dance



With every step, and every page
You look worn out, more and more each day
With every step, and every page

Your croft, dated back to the beginning of the century
It's the beginning of the century
Inside your croft, dated back to the beginning of the century
It's the beginning of the century

What are you looking for? You'll never get close
You definitely don't know, you're not original
What are you looking for? You'll never get close,
You definitely don't know, you definitely don't know
What you're about

You look worn out, more and more each day
With every step and every page
And you're still worn out, more and more each day
There's every way to......

Your croft, dated back to the beginning of the century
It's the beginning of the century
Inside your croft, dated back to the beginning of the century
It's the beginning of the century

What are you looking for? You'll never get close
You definitely don't know, you're not original
What are you looking for? You'll never get close
You definitely don't know, you definitely don't know
What you're about

What are you looking for? You'll never get close
You definitely don't know, you're not original
What are you looking for? You'll never get close
You definitely don't know, you definitely don't know
What you're about







Ive taken a fall would you like to see
Choke it down with a sound
All away from me
Keep em laughing
Girl do you see me

Break it down now
What you want anyway?
Right about now

Burn baby, burn it like a rocket
Can't sound can't tell 
Would you buy it
Fake skin now don't you wanna try it

Break it down now
What you want anyway?
Right about now
I'm fuckin up again
We keep falling in love
What a beautiful disaster

Connect my skull to the socket

Choke it down with a sound all away from me

Break it down now
Break it down now 

Break it down now
What you want anyway?
Right about now

We keep falling in love
What a beautiful disaster

Before you leave no trace
Time in this place was closer than my friends  
Remember my eyes not my face  
Innocence has no sense it invents  
Another man unfolds  
Well I'm standing next to myself the sink  
Staring into the black hole  

I panic at the quiet times  
Decisions at the door  
I panic at the quiet times  
Faith leaves me to much more

On the inside it hurts less  
The outside seems so cold  
I need to climb, I gotta find some tenderness  
Before I get too old  
The sun comes from behind, it hurts my eyes  
It dries my hair so nice  
I watch the boiling sea meet the open sky  
But my soul still feels like it's ice  

I panic at the quiet times  
Decisions at the door  
I panic at the quiet times  
Faith leaves me to much more

I panic at the quiet times  
Decisions at the door  
I panic at the quiet times  
Faith leaves me to much more



You talk and you laugh all the time
I want to walk over
I want to talk this over
Shelter my love from hate
Shelter my good from evil
She is not thinking of me
She is la la la la

Headclouds all around me
Headclouds coming over me
Headclouds all around me
Headclouds coming over me

I just woke up beside you
Nothing has changed your mind
Before I closed my eyes
You were a part of my life
Shelter my hopes and dreams
Shelter my heart from darkness
She is not convincing me
She is la la la la

Headclouds all around me
Headclouds coming over me
Headclouds all around me
Headclouds coming over me

It spells trouble, trouble, trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble



See that black boy over there, runnin' scared
his ol' man's in a bottle.
He done quit his 9 to 5 to drink full time
so now he's livin' in the bottle.
See that Black boy over there, runnin' scared
his ol' man got a problem
Pawned off damn near everything, his ol'
woman's weddin' ring for a bottle.

And don't you think it's a crime
when time after time,
And don't you think it's a crime
when time after time, people in the bottle.

See that sister, she look fine before she
started drinkin' wine
from the bottle.
Said her ol' man committed a crime
and he's doin' time,
so now she's in the bottle.
She's out there on the avenue, all by herself
sho' needs help from the bottle.
Preacherman tried to help her out,
she cussed him out and hit him in the head with a bottle.
And don't you think it's a crime
when time after time, people in the bottle.

See that gent in the wrinkled suit
he done damn near blown his cool
to the bottle
He wuz a doctor helpin' young girls along
if they wuzn't too far gone to have problems.
But defenders of the dollar eagle
Said "What you doin', Doc, it ain't legal,"
and now he's in the bottle.
Now we watch him everyday tryin' to
chase the pigeons away
from the bottle.
And don't you think it's a crime
when time after time, people in the bottle.



You left me drowning 
Like a hunter in the night 
I was your prey
And your heart is cold and dark 
You left me bleeding
Your plague was meant to kill 
I'm still here
I'm the amazone 
That you've brought out in me 
Fighting for my destiny
So go and watch your 

Kingdom burning down
And there's no one here to save you 
Cause you're all alone
Ay ya ya wild horses running free 
And don't you try to find me 
Watch your kingdom burn 
See it burning down!
See it burning down!

It's the warrior in me 
I'll keep on fighting 
It's too late to beg - please
Cause I have gone 
If you dare to come too close
I've got the weapons
Don't you dare come in my way
Cause I'll strike back!
I'm the amazone 
That you've brought out in me 
Fighting for my destiny
So go and watch your

Kingdom burning down
And there's no one here to save you 
Cause you're all alone 
Ay ya ya wild horses running free 
And don't you try to find me 
Watch your kingdom burn 
See it burning down!
See it burning down!

I have sailed all seven seas 
Conquered hearts of enemies
I have suffered for my dreams 
Made a deal with eternity

Kingdom burning down
And there's no one here to save you 
Cause you're all alone 
Ay ya ya wild horses running free 
And don't you try to find me 
Watch your kingdom burn 
See it burning down!
See it burning down!



The way you care for me, it's so kind.
Love to see you again, I wish I had more time".

She was laughing as she brushed my cheek
"Why don't you call me, angel, maybe next week
Promise now, cross your heart and hope to die".

But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye

Things I tried to put shine in her eyes
Wire wheels and shimmering things
Wild nights when the whole world seemed to fly

She said "The thing that's so unique
When we're together we don't have to speak.
We'll always be such good friends, you and I"

Oh but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying goodbye

Oh, she was saying goodbye, oh, she was saying goodbye
Oh, she was saying, saying, saying, saying



I guess I'm the kinda guy
That has to find out for myself
I had to learn the hardway, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm crying for help 

Now I've been high and I've been low
I've been some places that you will not go
I never thought there would come the day
When I wished I never would've lived this way
But I've been searching for a long, long time
I thought the devil was a friend of mine
I turned my back on everything that was true
And wasted years that belong to you 

Some people gotta learn the hardway
I guess I'm the kinda guy
That has to find out for myself
I had to learn the hardway, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm crying for help 

It took so long for me to see
That I'm a victim of nature and me
Left to myself I realize
I am the maker of my own demise 

But you accept me every time and again
And never mention just how selfish I've been
Why must it always take me so long to see
That I have fallen but you will forgive me? 

Some people gotta learn the hardway
I guess I'm the kinda guy
That has to find out for myself
I had to learn the hardway, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm crying for help 

Some people gotta learn the hardway
I guess I'm the kinda guy
That has to find out for myself
I had to learn the hardway, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm crying for help 

The warning signs are like flares in the night
Still I proceed my greed is in spite of the fire
I know that's bound to burn
Why is it that I always gotta learn...
The hardway, the hardway, I had to learn the hardway
The hardway, the hardway, I had to learn the hardway



Strikes an old church tower, a mile away
Based on old transcriptions from a song
We'll be mining tears from a stone

From a stone
From a stone
Tears from a stone, yeah

As the morning daylight enters here
We'll be adding curses to a prayer
Taking notes down as we go along
Yeah, we'll be mining tears from a stone

From a stone
From a stone
Tears from a stone

You shoot the blame out like a star
That never asked us who we are
You shoot a wish out to the sky
It never asked us where we hide
Yeah, where we hide

From a stone
Tears from a stone
Tears from a stone



I want to be ready 
I want to be ready Lord
Walking to Babylon with my gun
1 Brother Rasta is dead
Listen every body says: They shot Brothers Rasta Dead!
Braggin Boys in blue
They shot him through
So tonight's the night
We're gonna have a big fight
They got the power, we got the right
2 Now it's my turn 
I'm gonna take my gun 
And walk to Babylon 
Like a million
"They gonna kill you, son!", "Don't worry Mum"
Along my country way I'm gonna shout and say
"They shot Brother Rasta Dead"
Rudy left for the City
But three days later
Washed back by the Tide
Mum found his body on the Riverback



The sun beating hard on your door
Feel emotion roar within you
You're flesh and blood like anyone

Make some sense of your life
Move your hand and make the mark
I don't know why you're so confused
You're flesh and blood, there's no excuse

And the hunger inside
Won't go away, it's starting to rise
And the longer you hide
The more you deny
And the sea rushes in

The wind is howling at your back
The past is always overturned
It's a dead man who would refuse
and twice the man to fill his shoes

And the hunger inside
Won't go away it's starting to rise
And the longer you hide
The more you deny
And the hunger inside
Won't go away it's starting to rise
And the sea rushes in
Into my world

I can feel the king tide coming
All my senses overflowing
One night waiting out the back
Horns'll blow and cymbals crash
So paint a circle in the sky
I lay breathless in the arms of love
There's a bruise on my back
And a new understanding too



There is no time to waste asking why
I'll run away with you by my side
I'll run away with you by my side
close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride
asking why

I think about your face, and how I fall into your eyes
The outline that I trace, around the one that I call mine
A time that called for space, unclear where you drew the line
I don't need to solve this case, and I don't need to look behind

Close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
There is no time to waste asking why asking why
I'll run away with you by my side by my side
I'll run away with you by my side I'll run away with you
close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride
asking why

Do I expect to change the past I hold inside
With all the words I say repeating over in my mind
Some things you can't erase, no matter how hard you try
An exit to escape is all there is left to find

Close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
There is no time to waste asking why asking why
I'll run away with you by my side by my side
I'll run away with you by my side I'll run away with you
close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride
Until this echo, echo, echo, echo in my mind
Until this echo, echo, echo, echo can subside

So I
Close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
There is no time to waste asking why
I'll run away with you by my side
I'll run away with you by my side I'll run away with you
close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride
Until this echo, echo, echo, echo in my mind
Until this echo, echo, echo, echo can subside



Fast food and freedom, iron hand in velvet glove
For a fistful of dollars, anything at a price
It's always a gamble, say your prayers and roll the dice
History, for you and me, stretchin' out miles and miles
Liberty, equality, that's never going out of style Yeah

Spirit of America That's the spirit of America
Doin' okay just a heartbeat away
Spirit of America That's the spirit of America
You burn from coast to coast
Spirit of America That's the spirit of America
It's everybody's dream, there's a new tomorrow, now

The last lonesome cowboy, turns to make his final stand
Tall in his saddle, burning rifle in his hand
Now his world is a memory, and the freeway takes him home
Too tired and weary, for the man to stand alone

Reaching out, pushing hard, findin' your way at last
Shakin' loose, breakin' through, build a future from the past Yeah

History for you and me, stretchin' out miles and miles
Liberty, equality, that's never going out of style Yeah



Yeah you know I love you
I never want to see you go
No don't stop me
When I try to let it show

All your love all your love
Baby I want all your love
All your love all your love
Baby I want all your love

Don't keep me guessin'
Don't go round a messin'
I could never stand the feel
Don't say maybe
Don't drive me crazy
Come and let me show you my wheels

All your love all your love
Baby I want all your love
All your love all your love
Baby I want all your love

I can't wait much longer than tonight
Please don't stop me
No don't stop me tonight

C'mon Daddy
Love me little daddy
Show me what I need to know
Take me to the morning
All night to the morning
Let your little love light go

All your love all your love
Baby I want all your love
All your love all your love
Baby I want all your love



Didn't think of much, I don't need your crutch
So I spoke, it's a joke
When you tear apart what I try to start

Never want to worry again, could never count on a friend
What I know I have learned the hard way
Never want to see you again 'cause we will fight to the end
Now you know that I see things my way

Not you, the problem is mine anyway
It's true, it's where I have chosen to stay
Break through and see what's become of the game
I need a change

Here I go, sinking low
And it's in your eyes, it's me you despise
Always tried not to hide
But it's not enough and this road is rough

Never want to worry again, could never count on a friend
What I know I have learned the hard way
Never want to see you again 'cause we will fight to the end
Now you know that I see things my way

Not you, the problem is mine anyway
It's true, it's where I have chosen to stay
Break through and see what's become of the game
I need a change

Not you, the problem is mine anyway
It's true, it's where I have chosen to stay
Break through and see what's become of the game
I need a change

Do you need through your greed
To see me less, put me to the test
You can take my mistakes
I'll leave those behind 'cause I've got my mind

Not you, the problem is mine anyway
It's true, it's where I have chosen to stay
Break through and see what's become of the game
I need a change

Not you, the problem is mine anyway
It's true, it's where I have chosen to stay
Break through and see what's become of the game
I need a change

So good to see you again
I heard your woman left you
I heard you quit your band

How you on money?

Man, you don't look like you used to
My god, you look like a ghost

There's a riot going on
Inside of me
Won't you come inside

I know how to get my way
To make you love me, enchante

Now they love you
When you're alone
Let's call Jackie
See if he ain't home

Baby, I’m all right
Playing tricks with the light

They love me down in Texas
My home while I’m away
God knows I got my reasons
For every mutherfucking thing I say

Every time you go away
Take me down
I have gone astray
Take me down



Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone

I'm gonna need a hammer and nails
To construct this bitter lovesong
This crude testament in song
That rings out only when you're gone

Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone
Oh

Rude are the tongues of love
That speak of mercy for us all
And leave us only with a song
And leave us only with a song
Now there's a cold and hollow whisper
Whisper
That consumes my body when you're gone

Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone
Oh

And it's only when you're gone
And away
Your ghost moves through me in that special way
And it's a nice hotel
My hotel
Come fill the darkness of this prison cell
I'll love you long
And I'll love you
Well

So bury me in the kitchen
Bury me at the store
Bury me everywhere you go
In the shadows of the hallway
Ah for we do no longer know
What we can no longer hold
On days like these our heads fill up with smoke
And our memories grow old

Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone

Only when you're gone
Only, only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone

Gone away
And gone away
Oh



I'm goin' to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain

Well I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, well I'm going home

The miles are getting longer it seems, the closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true and I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try

So I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old

Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all and then some you don't want
Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all

Oh, I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me

But these places and these faces are getting old
I said these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, I'm going home



and it's starting to seem like there's nothing left 
like there's nothing left at all 
Well it drags me down, it's pulling me down 
lower, lower 
I feel it pullin, here it comes 
So come on take the time, 
come on, to make up your mind, 
come on, Let's give it all away 
Starts to wear me down 
And I can't get it to stop 
When's it gonna stop 
Look on your face, just the look on your face 
Makes me feel all a little down, down inside 
Come on, take the time, come on, make up your mind, come on 
Let's give it all away 
Come on, take the time, come on, make up your mind, come on 
Let's give it all away



Nobody wake up, there's nothing you could have done wrong

I'm wearing the same grin
I take it all on the chin
I still believe everything that I read
Sometimes it's hard
Sometimes it's harder
Sometimes it's on sale
Sometimes it never fails

Well I have a psychic
And she says I'm lonely
She says my destiny is turning out all wrong
So now I just sit here
And think of meaningful things to say

Symbolistic white walls surround me and you
Every single day, I am cheap and see-through
Symbolistic white walls surround me and you
Every single day, I am cheap and see-through

I'm tired of blood and over priced bubble gum, Mom
Nobody moves and nobody gets hurt for very long

I'm wearing the same skin
I take it all on the chin
I still believe everything that I hear
Sometimes it's easy
Sometimes it's easier
And sometimes it's all free
Sometimes it's all free

Well I have a psychic
And she says I'm lonely
She says inside of me is turning out all wrong
So now I just sit here
And think of meaningless things to say

Symbolistic white walls surround me and you
Every single day, I am cheap and see-through
Symbolistic white walls surround me and you
Every single day, we are cheap and see-through

And it's all right now
Take the world and make it yours again
And it's all right now
Take the world and make it yours again
And it's all right now
Take the world and make it yours again

And it's all right now
Take the world and make it yours again
Yours again, yours again, yours again



Screaming inside me
Boy you don't deserve this
And my weakness terrifies me
I must breathe in breathe out
Regaining my composure
Walked in the door
I feel him getting closer

Im starting he's not stopping
I stutter	 he's not bluffing

Feels like Im standing by
Watching me stumble
Watching me break you heart
Im stinking low, low
Im bout to let go
 not worth the tumble

 just let it slide
 don't let me crumble
 just say goodnight

On the very surface
I could take this lightly
But there's a darker purpose
And I tremble more than slightly
I much breathe in breathe out
He's causing my exposure
Who am I now?
Cause I don't even know her

Im burning its not nothing
Im turning he's not bluffing



Just staring out his window
Watching as the flames grew higher and higher
I thought that I saw him cry
Or was he only laughing
As his life went rushing on
And maybe were just like him
Maybe we're all waiting
For our moment to begin

Who of us are open
Who of us have freedom really
Who of us can tell what these dark days will bring
All of us are hurting
All of us are crazy now
All of us are watching the world as it spins

I once had a bird like you
A bird of prey
Still you're tearing at my insides
And yesterday when you flew so far away
If you find the morning save a piece for me

Who of us are open
Who of us have freedom really
Who of us can tell what these dark days will bring
All of us are hurting
All of us are crazy now
We're crazy now

I'll smoke the cigarette
I'll eat the flesh instead
Another whisky more or less or more or less yeah
I like the drugs that sail
I love you when we fail
When we fail

I once saw a man on fire
Just staring out his window
Watching as the flames grew higher and higher
I thought that I saw him cry
Or was he only laughing
Laughing

Who of us are open
Who of us have freedom really
Who of us can tell what these dark days will bring
All of us are hurting
All of us are crazy now
We're crazy now
We're crazy now

All of us are hating
All of us are dreaming
All of us are watching these times of our lives
We want it all
We want for nothing
For nothing now



I keep on driving, to the break of dawn 
And every house looks all the same 
I can’t tell the difference 
Who am I to blame 

Yeah, it’s alright to smile
Got no complaints 
Yeah, I’m all right 
Claim to be the same 
But I’m not, anymore 
That’s for sure 

If I start all over again
Would I have done it different?
Would I be the same?
Just as every love, that grows to be strong 
I can’t be there right now, another turn comes along 

Yeah, it’s alright to smile
Got no complaints 
Yeah, I’m all right 
Claim to be the same 
But I’m not, anymore 

I do the show then off I go 
I’ve done the best that I can 
And as the sea goes up and down 
So do we there’s nothing wrong with that 
I’m on my way back again 
Towards better and greater things 
If I stumble will you be there? 
Could use a hand 
Can I count on you? 

Yeah, it’s alright to smile
Got no complaints 
Yeah, I’m all right 
Claim to be the same 

Yeah, I’m alright to smile
Got no complaints 
Yeah, I’m all right 
Claim to be the same 
But I’m not, anymore 
That’s for sure.



To try and get your money back
You got caught trying to break in
But you just laughed and said 
"It couldn't have been me"

She shaved off her hair,
Said that she didn't care
And that life was so unfair,
Oh, and all that she wanted
Was to be left alone 

He said he missed bliss 
Smiled and left a kiss
And I said this isn't it 
And wont you please come home
And start again

Cos all you ever wanted, 
Has gone up in flames 
And all you ever wanted, 
Can never stay the same 

Oh no, this can't be happening 
I said oh no, this can't be happening 

Going to the race track
To try and get your money back, 
You got caught trying to break in, 
But you just laughed and said 
"It couldn't have been me"

She wore lip gloss 
Cried when she got cross 
And all that she had was lost 
She sold it all, 
All for pearls 

He said he missed bliss 
Smiled and left a kiss
And I said this isn't it 
And wont you please come home
And start again 

Cos all you ever wanted, 
Has gone up in flames 
And all you ever wanted, 
Can never stay the same 

And all you ever wanted, 
Has gone up in flames 
And all you ever wanted, 
Can never stay the same



The Rock island line is a Road to Ride
The Rock island line is a nighty good Road

But if you want to Ride
Gotta Ride it like you find it
Get a ticket of the Station
Of the Rock island line
I may be Right
Or I may be wrong
This mulla gonna miss me
When I'll be gone

The man at the tall gate is fodin' you
Don't give money to the Tall gate man!



We take all the things
You have no use for
Tear down all the brick walls
We take all the things
You have no use for

Into all the deep thoughts
We take all the things
You have no use for
In the back of your mind
We take all the things
You have no use for

Hold on, hold your horses
There's a big wall that we can't breach
And there must be a dark place
And there must be things
That we cannot reach

We take all the things
You have no use for



Let me dream alone.
And you see it never worked from the start,
All I got for all of my love was a broken heart.

Go away from my world,
And let me dream alone.
I'll dry my eyes and comb my hair,
And I'll pretend you're never there.

Now you're gone the breezes blow so sadly
You never could understand the love I wanted so badly.

Go away from my world,
And let me walk all alone.
All alone in my room,
All alone and so sad.

I can dream of how I wanted us to be
Dreams I have the kind I knew could ever be.

Go away from my world.



But there are things, that you must learn
That every man, must stand alone
And family you must disown

Go, find your own way
Go on, find your own way
Go, find your own way
Go on, find your own way

Don't cry my child, you must know
That every man, I've ever loved
Has been a child, and fatherless
Trust in yourself it's all in you can trust

Go, find your own way
Go on, find your own way
Go, find your own way
Go on, find your own way

Go, find your own way
Go, find your own way
Go child, find your own way
Go, find your own way

I have no time for hate or love
Hey, child, you're so full of woe
I have no time for hate or lying
Hey, child, you're no child of mine

I have no time for hate or love
Hey, child, you're so full of woe
I have no time for hate or lying
Hey, child, you're no child of mine
Hey, child, you're no child of mine
Hey, child, you're no child of mine



And this guy stops me
He'd just got in from New Zealand

I'm always questioning my sanity
Will I ever learn
I have always stolen my identity

Anyone forgive
Anyone forget
I don't want a life without respect
Life without respect

Feel there is no where that I fit
No where that I fit

I am a repeat offender
I will live with this forever
I am a repeat offender
I am a repeat offender

You have my word
There are only lies in my sincerity
I live in a world
That gives no meaning to integrity

Anyone forgive
Anyone forget
I don't want a life without respect
Life without respect

Feel there is no where that I fit
No where that I fit

I am a repeat offender
I will live with this forever
I am a repeat offender
I am a repeat offender

Someone take these handcuffs off my wrists and break the chain of habit!
Someone take these handcuffs off my wrists and break the chain of habit!

I don't want to life without respect...
I feel there is no where that I fit
No where that I fit

I am a repeat offender
I will live with this forever
I am a repeat offender
I am a repeat offender

Where do I turn
I'm always questioning my sanity
Will I ever learn
I've always stolen my identity



I tried and I failed and I'm tired and weary
Everything I ever done was wrong
And I feel like going home

Lord I tried to see it through
But it was too much for me
And now I'm coming home to you
And I feel like going home

Cloudy skies are rolling in
And not a friend around to help me
From all the places I have been
And I feel like going home

Lord I feel like going home
I tried and I failed and I'm tired and weary
Everything I ever done was wrong
And I feel like going home



The best was yet to come
Then lonely days turned to endless nights
The best was yet to come

How were you to know
That you would be the lucky one
Ain't it funny how time flies
When the best was yet to come

You can cry yourself to sleep at night
You can't change the things you've done
You had it there then it slipped away
Yeah you left the song unsung

Even through your tears
I never saw you come undone
What's so good about goodbye
When the best was yet to come

I find myself thinkin' about yesterday
When you were here and livin' in a dream
In the moment that it takes
You find you made your first mistake
Like the setting sun...
You turn around it's gone

Just a small time girl who had it made
Or so the story goes
She had it there then it slipped away
Oh - how was she to know

Even through her tears
I never saw her come undone
Ain't it funny how time flies
When the best was yet to come
What's so good about goodbye
When the best was yet to come



We've never had it so good
House in Hampstead, fallout bunker
Done everything we could
Fitted the Rolls with a shatterproof windscreen
Soon as we heard the news
Harrods do a nice little teargas
Even a woman can use

All good men at Number Ten
Everything's understood
Don't you worry, I'm alright, Jack
We've never had it so good

Don't you worry, I'm alright, Jack
We've never had it so good
There's plenty of grouse at the country house
We're eating as we should
Hugh's at Sandhurst, everything's safe
With Perkins running the farm
Half a dozen shotguns in the Land Rover
Ready for the call to arms

Gin traps down around the grounds
Trip wires out in the wood
Don't you worry, I'm alright, Jack
We've never had it so good

No please don't go, oh
No please don't go
You're breaking my heart again

How long, so long, who can tell me?
Would I be wrong?  Very likely
So long's too long, I'll be on my own again

How fair's farewell and fair to who?
No one can tell, tell it true
Still in the stands - I'm back on my own again, oh

You're all I know, no story
You're all I know, please don't worry
Don't worry, no...

Don't worry baby
Oh, don't cry no more

How fair's farewell and fair to who?
No one can tell, tell it true
Still in the stands - I'm back on my own again

So please don't go, oh
No please don't go, oh no
No please don't go
You're breaking my heart again

You're all I know, no story
You're all I know, please don't worry
Don't worry, no, whoa, no...

Oh, don't worry baby

Old ties that bind, don't stop the wheeling
Too late to find, no-one is really
Locked on mine, back on my own again

Whoa please don't go oh please don't go
No please don't go oh please don't go
No please don't go oh please don't go
You're breaking my heart again



Find your place find your place and walk right through

Bomb my pride do me under over never let it go

Can you hear this music?
Do you really think
Love is gonna change the world?

Is this feeling right
Can you hear this music?
Do you really think
We are gonna change the world?

Our time is short and we can't even see
The clocks we're missing
Our lives are lost
We won't even care until it's over

Go and find that distant tone
And say what you've been trying to say
'Cause the voice is ghostly but you can find it
The voice is ghostly and you can find it
Or you can walk away

Is this sounding right
Can you hear the music?
Do you really think
Love is gonna change the world?

Is this feeling right
Can you feel this music?
Do you really think
We are gonna change the world

There's more to find more than life
And love and conversation
We can't hide behind the stained
Glass window of a high class nation

Let's get right or something
Let's get this right
We're losing time and fading
We're losing time

Stop the music
Stop the trend
Start the worship
Stop the band



On the night before the longest day
A celebration in rhythm
At this time it was always this way
Sing out for the one light,
Reach out to the flame
So fine so fine
That we can make it this way
  
Sing the song of the ages
Giving voice on this beautiful night
Feed the flame in high places
From the earth to the giver of light
Sing out for the one light
Reach out to the flame
So fine so fine
That we can make it this way
  
Bringing peace to the valley
Carry fire through the oaks and the grove
Precious memory carry
As we move through the circles and stones
Sing out to the one light
Reach out to the flame
So fine, So fine
That we can make it this way



Slipping through the heavens
Like a 747
Everyone left down below

Locked in a house of my invention
Learning the "don't"s of fire prevention
If I roast marshmallows over their bodies
Do you think god will still find their souls?

Just want to be like we used to
Under the influence
Just want to see like we used to
Under the influence
Under the in--

I dreamed I was a White Tip
Slipping through the Pacific
My heart for a shipwreck
And your legs left down below

Some things they come
All things they go
There ain't nothing like exploding
If you've got
Something to explode
Something

Just want to be like we used to
Under the influence
Just want to see like we used to
Under the influence
Under the in--

Just want to be like we used to
Under the influence
Just want to see like we used to
Under the influence

Under the in-- ah, ah
Under the in-- ah, ah



And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late - but I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - is it just my sickly pride?
Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late

The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

It's late - but it's driving me so mad
It's late - yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's
Too late - save our love you can't turn out the lights
So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late

I've been so long
You've been so long
We've been so long tryin' to work it out
I ain't got long
You ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

Too late much too late
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life alright?

It's late - but it's time to set me free
It's late - yes I know but there's no way it has to be
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late - so let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late it's late it's late it's late
It's late it's late
It's all too late



I saw the green
I saw the tainted black
Stains of ink and wax

Black bird and a green hand held
Held inside my head
And inside my head
A vast astronomy of birds
Look at the wall
The paint has already started to come off
It's all for nothing I guess

Which side are you on?
Which side are you on?
Yeah
Side

I fall into the wheel of the moon
With a circle of sand and bad dreams
See, everything piles up now
And everything's exactly what it seems

I feel tempted to call a friend
And say: 

Now, which side are you on?
Which, which side
Are you, are you on?

Once again I cross the narrow field
I came to the road but the path was gone
Not there
I spanned around, I caught the sun
I , but then it turned blue
It's just a stain, don't mean a thing
It's just a stain, it's just blood

I should've lied
I should've lied
I could've lied

Which side are you on?
Which, which side
Are you on?

If you come back the house will never be the same again
No
What?



Turning to leave
Feeling her lonely stare
If only a secret love

Left more than a broken heart
Like a fool thnks he felt the start
Of what he hoped for so long

He waits though he knows she's gone
Alone he climbs
Until he falls

Only a secret love brings more than a broken heart

Like a fool I have played the part
Of what I hoped for so long
The need to belong...
In love



All I wanted was for you to come
Back to me say sorry, baby I was wrong
But I waited my faith was strong this hurt could be undone
Time goes by 
And hope subsides
I fell for way too long

I don't know any change 
Cus I was always imagining we'd be together 
Cus I loved you
And now you're standing here 
I realize time really heals 
Cus I feel better 
Than I could be

I cried for so many nights
Wishing you're by my side
My heart's so tired of breaking
Suddenly here you are
You're saying all the words
I was waiting for 
But I don't want you no more

You got the same smile you did before
Used to make me weak in the knees
I look in your eyes used to drive me wild
But I already made my peace
Who knew there would come a time
When you said yes and I said no
Cuz I miss ya so long since you've been gone
I've been tryin? to let you go

I don't know any change 

Cus I was always imagining we'd be together 
Cus I loved you
And now you're standing here
I realize time really heals 
Cus I feel better 
Than I thought I could be

I cried for so many nights
Wishing you're by my side
My heart's so tired of breaking
Suddenly here you are
You're saying all the words
I was waiting for 
But I don't want you no more

No more sleepin?
With the lights turned on
No more weepin?
Cuz you didn't come home
No more lonely
Inside this heart
Your love don't live here anymore

I cried for so many nights
Wishing you're by my side
My heart's so tired of breaking
Suddenly here you are
You're saying all the words
I was waiting for 
But I don't want you no more x2



I don't see why I shouldn't try to catch up with you
'Cause in my mind a 1,000 times or more I've been there before
There's nothing I can see that will stop me, believe me

Our time will come and I don't think I will let
Another chance pass me by
Our time will come and I don't think I will let
Another chance pass me by

No, I don't want you to get bored like you have a 1,000 times before
Give me some time just to show that I am up to it

Our time will come and I don't think I will let
Another chance pass me by
Our time will come and I don't think I will let
Another chance pass me by

There's something that can be done
To bring us back together as one
There's something else I can do
That's why I'm sending this message to you

I will try another 1,000 times to bring us back together as one
I will try another 1,000 times till you decide to change your mind
I will try another 1,000 times to bring us back together as one
I will try another 1,000 times till you decide to change your mind
I will try another 1,000 times to bring us back together as one
I will try another 1,000 times till you decide to change your mind



Leaving distorted cars trailing behind,
We move like bullets!
No danger, no danger
We take that for granted.

Crossed the bridge, left the network behind,
I could feel it in my heart.
We gauge ourselves and the scenery too,
We push on forever and a day.

This is the Ice Age...
x6

Feeling the trees and the wind on my face,
Passing along single file,
Might be autumn but we know it's not,
Cynosures hiding in the air.

All we did was close our eyes,
A moment come unhinged.
All we did was close our eyes,
A world falling into shape.

The wind purls over a hinterland of long grass,
gold, where tiny black horses play.
Distant mountains move like water.
My friend is with me, a familiar voice,
an unfinished memory:
"This is the Age of Innocent Passion."



So tonight I'll raise my glass to us
Cause we've talked so much I think we filled this ashtray twice
And I'm pretty sure we emptied every bottle in the place, so...

Let's walk home 
Let's be afraid
Wanna grab you by the arms and kiss you 
So hard
Let's do it right 
Under the streetlight
I want it now 
Somehow I forgot how

Way to go, way to go
Forgot you've got so far to go
Way to go, way to go
Forgot you've got so far to go

I heard everybody's voice cut out when you spoke
And I watched all the lights go dim when your eyes opened
Well I can't believe you showed up, what do I do now?
It's last call, time to go, but before we say goodnight

Let's walk home 
Let's be afraid
Wanna grab you by the arms and kiss you 
So hard
Let's do it right 
Under the streetlight
I want it now 
Somehow I forgot how

Way to go, way to go
Forgot you've got so far to go
Way to go, way to go
Forgot you've got so far to go







Trying hard to feel doubt
My book dropped to the ground
At the part where the frontiers are all pulled down

But they couldn't and they wouldn't have
They couldn't and they shouldn't have
But they could and they would have

I inherited a nature
In a language all worn out
And wallowed by the windows
At a rambling house at the edge of

What I couldn't have
I couldn't and I shouldn't have
I could and I should have

Someday you'll find a heaven
Full of the guilt and freedom
Of somewhere younger than America
Bordering what we can hope to have

Through the north woods
East out of this slow motion town
Through the willows and the aspens
Cos you've been weighed down
Full of what

You couldn't have
You couldn't and you shouldn't have
You could and you should have

Someday you'll find a heaven
Full of the guilt and freedom
Of somewhere younger than America
Bordering what we can hope
And from the first edition
Of East of Eden
You find a version of America
Born in what we can hope to have

Someday you'll find a heaven
Full of the guilt and freedom
Of somewhere younger than America
Bordering what we can hope



Sleeping on a plane
There's something ticking in the overhead
And inside your brains

There's bodies in the water
And bodies in your basement
If Heaven's for clean people
It's vacant

Hey, are you, are you, are you, are you, you know?
Hey, are you, are you being careful
Hey, are you, are you, are you lukewarm?
Hey, yeah you are

I'm frantic
So load me up
Whatever puts me all the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out

Picture yourself
Swimming in an ocean
A million miles from nowhere
And the nearest phone

There's bodies in the water
Floating all around you
And all of them are talking
And they're comedians

Hey, are you, are you, are you, are you, you know?
Hey, are you, are you, are you, are you special?
Hey, are you, are you, are you, are you deformed?
Hey, yeah you are

I'm frantic
So load me up
It seems so practised
Me fucking this up
Whatever puts me all the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out

Picture yourself
At the MGM Grand
Murphy's fighting Occam
You're in the stands, and

There's somebody in the water
In the middle of the ocean
A million miles from nowhere
And they're alone
I'm there alone

So, so deformed
So, so deformed
So, so deformed

I'm frantic
So load me up
It's seems so practised
Just take me and take me and take me
All the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out



Fairlane cruiser coming up on the left hand side
Headlight shining, driving rain on the window frame
Little young Lady Stardust hitching a ride... and it's 

2-4-6-8 ain't never too late
Me and my radio truckin' on thru the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light 

Whizzkid sitting pretty on your two-wheel stallion
This ol' ten-ton lorry got a bead on you
Ain't no use setting up with a bad companion
Ain't nobody get the better of you-know-who 

2-4-6-8 ain't never too late
Me and my radio truckin' on thru the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light 

Well there ain't no route you could choose to lose the two of us
Ain't nobody know when you're acting right or wrong
No-one knows if a roadway's leading nowhere
Gonna keep on driving home on the road I'm on... 

2-4-6-8 ain't never too late
Me and my radio truckin' on thru the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light



Fell asleep in the sun
You had to move into the shade
Before you fired the gun

We got a hunger for destruction
Need someone to bleed
You sealed the deal before the dawn
You let your actions proceed

Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Sooner or later said you know that it's true
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you

You think you're so sly
You tried to roll by
You played the safe side
You said will somebody take me
Downtown
Another James Brown
You made the same sound
You said will somebody write this down... down

Fightin' back revenge
You've got you're face to the ground
You make excuses for the madness
You've been hanging around

You built a house up in the trees
So you could see everyone
You set the clock and had a run
You set the clock and had a run

Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Sooner or later said you know that it's true
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you

You think you're so sly
You tried to roll by
You played the safe side
You said will somebody take me
Downtown
Another James Brown
You made the same sound
You said will somebody write this down... down

Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Sooner or later said you know that it's true
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you

You think you're so sly
You tried to roll by
You played the safe side
You said will somebody take me
Downtown
Another James Brown
You made the same sound
You said will somebody write this down



Empty mind, empty bank account. 
If this is your piece, your piece is a mess to me. 

Hundreds killed on the internet. 
Life delete, all is set. 
If this is your truth, your truth is a mess to me. 

If common sense means no control, 
You've got it all. 
If common sense means no control, 
You've got it all, you've got it. 
If common sense means no control, 
You've got it all. 
If common sense means no control. 

Sitting choking on the office chair. 
Empty mind, empty bank account. 
If this is your piece, your prophet is piece to me. 

Thousands killed on the internet 
Life delete, all is set. 
If this is your truth, your truth is a mess to me. 
Yeah. 

If common sense means no control, 
You've got it all. 
If common sense means no control, 
You've got it all, you've got it. 
If common sense means no control, 
You've got it all. 
If common sense means no control. 
You've got it. 
You've got it. 

Love your money, love your money. 
Love your money, love your money.

Show us all what you can do 
We need a man with vision 
So we put our trust in you 
And now we hope sincerely 
That you'll do the best that you can do

For sure it won't be easy 
And we will have to risk our lives 
Some will try to break us 
And cut us down to size 
But just remember 
There can be no consolation prize 
Not in our eyes

It's a long way to go 
We can't wait one more day 
We need someone to light up the way 
We may run out of time 
Can you hear what we say? 
Because heaven is so far away

Although time is getting short 
There's still some sand left in the glass 
And now we have a living breathing 
Rocket man at last 
It's time to take a step 
And nail our colors to the mast

No more talk of great adventures 
When it's movement that we need 
It must be our intention 
That we never lose the lead 
So count us down to zero 
And let's get up to speed 
We're up and away

It's a long way to go 
We can't wait one more day 
We need someone to light up the way 
We may run out of time 
So believe what we say? 
Because heaven is so far away

And so now they cry for justice 
As if justice will be done 
But the eye up in the sky 
Was flying too close to the sun 
The Challenger has fallen 
And the race has now been run



I'd stick it in a needle and I'd feed it into my arm

But I'm old enough to know old enough to know no no
Yeah I'm old enough to know old enough to know no no

I can reflect on the day's when respect had nothing to do with behaviour
And I can recall a day when we'd all laugh in the face of our failure

Yeah I'm old enough to know old enough to know no
Yeah old enough to know old enough to know no no

And guess who just threw up when we learned that he grew up
Yeah...
And guess what he learned when his fingers got burned
That we'd all sing the absurd

And guess what I heard when a mass of heads turned
That we'd all sing the absurd



You want to go somewhere where you don't know
You always run and when I try to run
You leave me bent over with a stitch in the road

You are a maze, a complex sum
I've counted all my fingers and I'm on to my thumb
You are the storm, you are my little storm
I watch the wind change to find out where you've been blown

Pull it up and steer it over
Cut the lights, this game is over
Pull it up and steer it over
Cut the lights, this game is over

You conjure a key in the palm of your hand
You're burning all your bridges, drawing a line in the sand
We travel far, catch the last of the sun
We keep on going till we've nowhere to run

Look at the hills, they look so green
The horizon is the place that you always dream
We shoot the nest like the ball from the gun
You're tapping on the door to the beat of the drum

Pull it up and steer it over
Cut the lights, this game is over
Pull it up and steer it over
Cut the lights, this game is over

Look out the front, it looks so free
It's the only real thing that's been happening to me
You've taken all you thought was wrong
You used it for the lyrics of your favorite song

You are a maze, a complex sum
I've counted all my fingers and I'm on to my thumb
You are the storm, you are my little storm
I watch the wind change to find out where you've been blown

Pull it up and steer it over
Cut the lights, this game is over
Pull it up and steer it over
Cut the lights, this game is over

Pull it up and steer it over
Cut the lights, this game is over
Pull it up and steer it over
Cut the lights, this game is over







It's a revelation, too late
Have a listen to this cold heart
It's a revolution, too late
It has to be this way

Please don't tell me now
Please don't say it's over now
There's no conversation
There's no conversation
Please don't turn cold now
Tell me there's a way somehow
Without conversation
Without conversation

Missing hours, I don't think so
It's a recognition on time
Be my weakness, you my saviour
Look in my eyes this time
Does it have to be this way?

Please don't tell me now
Please don't say it's over now
There's no conversation
There's no conversation
Please don't turn cold now
Tell me there's a way somehow
Without conversation
Without conversation

I don't fall for the same trick twice
No I won't fall for the same thing twice
No I won't fall for the same thing twice

Please don't tell me now
Please don't say it's over now
There's no conversation
There's no conversation
Please don't turn cold now
Tell me there's a way somehow
Without conversation
Without conversation



We could stay awake all night
And when people get up to go to work
We'll be holding each other tight

Turn off all the lights
Come hibernate with me
Oh mommy bear and daddy bear
As angry as can be

I'm too sad to get out of bed
And I send the servants home
So I'll leave the people a knocking
And I've unplugged the phone

Turn off all the lights
Come hibernate with me
Oh mommy bear and daddy bear
As angry as can be



History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh ev'ry night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays

Toe your line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall

Rich or poor or famous
For your truth it's all the same oh no, oh no
Lock your door the rain is pouring
Through your window pane oh no
Baby now your struggle's all in vain, hey, hey

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall

It's gonna fall
Hammer
You know
Hammer to fall
While you're waiting for the hammer to fall
Give it to me one more time



You came a knocking, knocking on my door
Yeah you really got me going
But you kept me on ice
I didn't care where I was going
No I didn't think twice

I was just a young girl
I was so green
You were so experienced
You know what I mean
Still you really got me going
But you kept me on ice
I didn't care where I was going
No I didn't think twice

Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seems kind of sad
We just sat around and watched it all go bad
Blind faith was all we had

You said I never thanked you
For everything you'd done
I had to do a lot of walking
Before I could run
Still you really got me going
But you kept me on ice
I didn't care where I was going
No I didn't think twice

Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seems kind of sad
We just sat around and watched it all go bad
Blind faith was all we had

But then it said "all my friends are drunks"

A face in the crowd - no one knows your name
It's a table for one and a broken heart to go

She's the kind of lover that you always dreamed
Would come to stay and never wanna leave
But that's all changed - she's dealt the final blow
Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of
Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love

It doesn't matter who was right or wrong
When the fire is over - when the magic's gone
You pick up the pieces and do the best you can

It knocks you down but you try it again
You get a little older it's a cryin' shame
Sometimes things don't work out like you plan

Who's gonna help when you've had enough
It ain't no secret you're a victim of love
Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of
Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love

One goodbye was really all it took
Now you thumb through the pages of your little black book
But somehow all the numbers look the same
You've been thinkin' how to get around it
But there ain't nothin' you can do about it
Nothin' ventured - nothin' gained

Ain't nothin' you can't rise above
Call it what you want but you're a victim of love

Who's gonna help you when you've had enough
Ain't no secret you're a victim of love

I don't wanna lose your love...



two fireflys lightin up the sky 
two stars shining through the clouds
two clouds floating in the sky

we'll be like the moon when the sun is rising
two bees buzzing round a flower
two crickets singing...
two roses budding in the spring time

we'll be like the rain fallin in the desert
the milky way and the north star
we'll be like two peas in a pod
we'll be of the same mind and god

we'll be in love
we'll be in love
we'll be like two birds falling in love
we'll be like two birds falling in love
we'll be in love



Late last night
Told her somethin' didn't feel quite right
She looked at me
Half asleep
Said "You're crazy just go back to bed"

I walked two miles
To be alone
Felt the cool air against my bones
On second street
I'll second guess 
Everything I said

Are you near?
Are you still gonna save me?
From my fears
Are you still gonna save me?

Beyond the hills
Beneath the stars
By Saint Christopher I fell apart
The sun came up
So high above
I could not let myself be loved

Are you near?
Are you still gonna save me?
From my fears
Are you still gonna save me?

I need the daylight
Need the daylight now
There is a stranger in my head
Put my clothes on
Left a note that read
"I'm sorry my love failed again"

I woke her up
Late last night
Told her somethin' didn't feel quite right

Are you near?
Are you still gonna save me?
From my fears
Are you still gonna save me?



You seem to feel so cold
It may sound worse today
Go on and tell me something's changing
You need to be alone
And take some time away
We all must survive
On what keeps us alive
Don't go, take this too far
Stay here for a while
Don't go, leave this behind
Stay here for some time
So, you've found yourself a partner
It seemed to take so long
A place to call your home
Still, you need so much to listen
To each and everyone
Their hearts except your own
We all must survive
On what keeps us alive
Don't go, take this too far
Stay here for a while
Don't go, leave this behind
Stay here for some time



Can make me feel it might be worth
The trouble just to see the look
It kills me i forget
I dont believe in love and I want to believe

Just a word
Can make me feel theres nothing worth
The trouble just to hear the word
It fills me with regret
I dont believe in love and i want to believe

Death, keep loving me to death
Keep loving me to death
I cant believe in love and i want to believe

Waiting for the mortal wound
This fascination with the moribund
Looking out my dirty window i find
2x

Keep loving me to death 3x



Go to sleep
Close your eyes
Get so dizzy
The world is spinning
In your bed
I know where the sun goes
It's waking up the sparrows
In England it's morning

In time, you'll see that some things travel faster than light
In time you'll recognise that love is larger than life

Now you know what you're missing
Now you've seen that I'm willing
If you're looking for the message
Close your eyes

Do you hear what I'm thinking?
Is it how you've imagined?

In time you'll see that some things travel faster than light
In time you'll recognise that love is larger than life
And praise will come to those whose kindness
Leaves you without debt
And bends the shape of things that haven't happened yet

Close your eyes

Colours changing like a lizard
Close your eyes

I know where the sun goes
I have seen the world turning

In time you'll find that some things travel faster than light
In time you'll recognise that love is larger than life
And praise will come to those whose kindness
Leaves you without debt
And bends the shape of things to come that haven't happened yet



Yeah I've been so strung out
Can you picture this?
I'll take something, it's better than nothing, anything
That you've got to give

I can't let go
I don't want you to know
I've been down so low
Can you save me?
I'll fight my way
Just to hear you say
If I go up in flames
Could you save me?

The more you whisper
The words keep stinging in my ear
We're never gunna be the same
Sunshine fading
And black sheets raining down on me
They cover up everything

I can't let go
I don't want you to know
I've been down so low
Could you save me?
I'll fight my way
Just to hear you say
If I go up in flames
Could you save me?

I've been so selfish
I get so high
Don't wanna come down

I've been so low
Yeah I've been so strung out
Can you picture this?

I can't let go
I don't want you to know
I've been down so low
Could you save me?
I'll fight my way
Just to hear you say
If I go up in flames
Could you save me?



One more compromise I won't be making
One more easy way out I won't be taking
So many chances don't come twice
So many eyes are made of ice
One more cheating hand I won't be shaking

One more substitute I won't be trying
One more piece of the rock that I'm not buying
So many times we stand and fight
So many reasons can't be right
One more simple truth I'm not denying

Too many lonely hearts in the real world
Too many lonely nights in the real world
Too many fools who don't think twice
Too many ways to pay the price
Don't wanna live my life in the real world

One more sacrifice I won't be making
One more golden rule I won't be breaking
No one to let me state my case
No one to tell me to my face
One more sweet suprise I won't be faking

Too many lonely hearts in the real world
Too many lonely nights in the real world
Too many bridges you can burn
Too many tables you can't turn
Don't wanna live my life in the real world

Too many lonely hearts in the real world
Too many lonely nights in the real world
Too many games that I can't play
Too many windmills in my way
Don't wanna live in the real world

until you've seen the stars
reflect in the reservoirs

And you have never been in love
until you've seen the dawn rise
behind the Home for the Blind

We are the Pretty Petty Thieves
and you're standing on our streets
where Hector was the
first of the gang with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die, oh my

Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die, oh my

You have never been in love
until you've seen the sunlight thrown
over smashed human bone

We are the Pretty Petty Thieves
and you're standing on our streets
where Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die
Such a silly boy

Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and a bullet in his gullet
and the first lost lad
to go under the sod

And he stole from the rich and the poor
and the not very rich and the very poor
and he stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
Away...
He stole all hearts away
Away...



Standing in the dark
You were acting so in love
With your hand upon his heart

But you were just friends
At least that's what you said
Now I know better from his fingers in your hair
I forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one

I've had other options too
But all I want is you
Girl your body fits me like a glove
And you shower me with words of love

While you were just friends
At least that's what you said
Now I know better from his fingers in your hair
I forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one

It's not my style to lay it in on the line
But you don't leave me with a choice this time
Why weren't you true?
You know I trusted you 

When you were just friends
At least that's what you said
Now I know better from his fingers in your hair
I forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one

You were just friends
At least that's what you said
Now I know better from his fingers in your hair
I forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one

I'll forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one
I'll forgive you for what you've done
If you say I'm the one
I'll forgive you



Sixteen tons on the move
Blue, strange colour blue
Coming back to you
Pushing through the pouring rain
Nearly there, nearly there
Oh blue

Blue, strange colour blue
Sixteen tons on the move
Hey, little mister driver man
Keep your head up
We are nearly there

I am racing
Outside and below myself
Nearly forgot myself there
Nearly there, yeah

Oh, everybody's sleeping now
In industrial silence
And the rain, it will keep hammering down overhead

Now there's a blue, blue, a strange colour blue
Let me dream of me and you
Oh, while the rain keeps coming down hard

Oh, running down the window
Like a vein on my arm
Oh, running down the window
Like a vein on my arm, yeah

This is how we do it
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
Nearly there

This is how we do it
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
Nearly there

Oh, blue, strange colour, a colour blue
Yeah a colour blue
Oh, blue, blue, blue, yeah
Strange colour, a colour blue
Yeah, a colour blue

Oh, blue, blue, blue, yeah
Strange colour, a colour blue
Oh, a colour blue

Hey, little mister driver man
Keep your head up
We are nearly there
Nearly there



Frightening lies from the other side

Stand up and fight for your rights
 
Freedom... we're talking bout your freedom
Freedom to choose what you do with your body
Freedom to believe what you like
Freedom for brothers to love one another
Freedom for black and white
Freedom from harassment, intimidation
Freedom for the mother and wife
Freedom from Big Brother's interrogation
Freedom to live your own life... I'm talking 'bout

"Today, institutions fundamental to the British system of Government are under attack: the public schools, the house of Lords, the Church of England, the holy institution of Marriage, even our magnificent police force are no longer safe from those who would undermine our society, and it's about time we said 'enough is enough' and saw a return to the traditional British values of discipline, obedience, morality and freedom.
What we want is:
 
Freedom from the reds and the blacks and the criminals
Prostitutes, pansies and punks
Football hooligans, juvenile delinquents
Lesbians and left wing scum
Freedom from the niggers and the Pakis and the unions
Freedom from the Gipsies and the Jews
Freedom from leftwing layabouts and liberals
Freedom from the likes of you..."

You gotta run me down
If you want to contact me
You gotta run me down

I got work to do
I'm the busiest man in town
You gotta run me down

When I gets my dough
I'm kinda hard to find
If you want me to pay your bills
You gotta run me down

Now the rooster he crowed
And then old hens looked around
Said if you want to make love
You gotta run me down

When I had my money
You used to follow me around
Now I have got broke
You gotta run me down

You gotta run me down
You gotta run me down
If you want to contact me
You gotta run me down



You found the frequency, you sucked it outta me
I'm not the only one, to hold a smoking gun
You felt the gravity, you think you're finally free

I don't even know, which way it oughtta go
Get out before you drown, before they bring us down
It's all inside of me, my only enemy
You sucked it outta me, you fucked it outta me

I'll watch the world turn on
I'll watch the world turn on
I'll watch the world turn on
my only enemy

I want it all before you go
I want it all before you go
I want it all before you go

I don't ever try, to keep the love alive
You found the frequency, you sucked it outta me
You sucked it outta me, you sucked it outta me
My only enemy, my only enemy

I'll watch the world turn on
I'll watch the world turn on
I'll watch the world turn on
My only enemy, my only enemy
My only enemy, my only enemy
My only enemy

Well, fuck you
Well, fuck you



Below the sun
I've wandered endlessly and waited for
My time to come

I think I'm drowning
Can someone lend a hand?
Can someone save me?
Cause I don't think I can

I've gone too far to turn around
It's hard to reach for you
When I'm lying face down
I can't relieve my soul
I'm lost in a moment
Lying face down

Returning home I find myself
Wishing I was already gone
But how long does it take to find me
Well I'm waiting for someone

I think I'm drowning
Can someone lend a hand?
Can someone save me?
Cause I don't think I can

I've gone too far to turn around
It's hard to reach for you
When I'm lying face down
I can't relieve my soul
I'm lost in a moment
Lying face down

I've gone too far to turn around
It's hard to reach for you
When I'm lying face down
I can't relieve my soul
I'm lost in a moment
Lying, Lying

I've gone too far to turn around
I've gone too far to turn around
In a moment
Lying face down



I've had it up to here...
But I'm still standing

Screaming as you fall
I'm making this point clear...
But you're not listening

Apologies are so unusal
but it's unusual 
to make amends

I just want this to be over,
I need some time to think.

So why won't you leave me?
you're better off together with him
rather than me!

Don't deny the truth
I moved on you're still here...
understand me

With your crying eyes
wipe off all your tears...
cuz I'm not listening

Apologies are so unusual
but I am comfortable to
not be friends

I just want this to be over,
I need some time to think.

So why won't you leave me?
you're better off together with him
rather than me!

So why...
did I abandon you?
and ruin the valdation, 
that we'd lose?

well I...
I've been commited to 
waiting and pleasing you
make this clear..

Why won't you leave me?
you don't want 
this to be over,
I just need time to think.
and When will you leave me?
You're better off together with him
rather than me.

So why won't you leave me...??
I need some time to think

So why won't you leave me?
You're better off together with him, 
rather than me!



As my time goes by, I see your hands gripping 
But there's nothing I can do 
If it's happening to you 
As my life goes by, the world has stopped spinning

Someday they will find me and take me away 
And you will think of me just when it rains 
'Cos I know that it's never felt so good

As my time goes by, I feel the saint swelling 
As my eyes go blind, I hear the sky calling 
Lose yourself, lose your soul and mind 
As your time goes by I hope that you are listening

Someday they will find me and take me away 
And you will think of me just when it rains 
'Cos I know that it's never felt so good

Someday they will find me and take me away 
And you will think of me just when it rains 
'Cos I know that it's never felt so good



It's something 
I'm on a great height 
For someone 
And you oughta know 
It's you 
Ooh you are my wake-up call 

This love is a way of living 
I'm not used to this life 
I'm used to solitude 
Ooh you are my wake-up call 

I don't think about the future 
I don't talk about the past 
I'm wondering how 
Could this last 
Ooh get high before you fall 

I get that feeling 
A sensation of trust 
And I can't get enough 
It's so easy 
I'm not holding back  
No more 
I guess 
Nothing like it, this is 
My endeavour my bliss 
It's been stunning this is 
My salvation my bliss 

I'm on a big train  
It's coming 
I'm on a big train 
To someone 
And you oughta know 
It's you 
Ooh you are my wake-up call 

I put a lotta weight 
Upon your shoulder 
But you keep up straight 
Just like a woman 
And that's just what you do 
Ooh you are my wake-up call 

I'm on a great height 
It's something 
I'm on a great height 
For someone 
And you oughta know 
It's you 
Ooh get high before you fall 

I get that feeling 
A sensation of trust 
And I can't get enough 
It's so easy 
I'm not holding back  
No more 
I guess 
Nothing like it, this is 
My endeavour my bliss 
It's been stunning this is 
My salvation my bliss 

Lalalala...



Don't tell my family, they're all wicked strict Christians
Don't tell the hangers-on, don't tell your friends
Don't tell them we went down to Ybor City again

Don't tell the dancers, they'll just get distracted
Don't tell the DJs, they already suspect us
Don't mention the bloodshed, don't mention the skins
Don't tell them Ybor City almost killed us again

We are the theater, they are the people
Dressed up to be seated, looking upwards and dreaming
We're the projectors, we're hosting the screening
We're dust in the spotlights, we're just kind of floating

Don't drop little hints, I don't want them to guess
Don't mention Tampa, they'll just know all the rest
Don't mention bloodshed, don't tell them it hurts
Don't say we saw angels, they'll take us straight to the church

They queue up for tickets to see the performance
They push to get closer, looking upwards with wonder
We are the actors, the cameras are rolling
I'll be Ben Gazzara, you'll be Gina Rowlands

Sometimes actresses get slapped
Sometimes actresses get slapped
Sometimes fake fights turn out bad
Sometimes actresses get slapped

Some nights making it look real
Might end up with someone hurt
Some nights it's just entertainment
And some other nights it's work

They come in for the feeding, sit in stadium seating
They're holding their hands out for the body and blood now
We're the directors, our hands will hold steady
I'll be John Cassavettes, let me know when you're ready

Man, we make our own movies
Man, we make our own movies
Man, we make our own movies
Man, we make our own movies



Love you for worse and better, oh
Well, I have my doubts about it

Tomorrow is another venue
Another city, a new hotel room, oh
And I just can't live without it

Reach out and catch your moment
This heart of mine was made for touring

Bless the night, it's now or never
You and I and tons of pleasure
Bless the night
Enjoy the moment with me

Bless the night, it's now or never
You and I close together
Bless the night
Enjoy the moment with me

A broken heart is what I offer
And I'm not worth a life in torture, no
You're happier without it

So baby put your arms around me
Save tonight in your mind's diary, oh
Eat me while you have me

Bless the night, it's now or never
You and I and tons of pleasure
Bless the night
Enjoy the moment with me

Bless the night, it's now or never
You and I close together
Bless the night
Enjoy the moment with me
With me, yeah

A broken heart is what I offer
And I don't wanna see you suffer
Tonight I wanna be your lover

Bless the night, it's now or never
You and I and tons of pleasure
Bless the night
Enjoy the moment with me, whoa yeah

Bless the night, it's now or never
You and I close together
Bless the night
Enjoy the moment with me, yeah

Bless the night
Bless the night
Bless the night



I'm moving fast as I can
Sliding over in her direction
Pause to check out my reflection
She's wearing all the right clothes
The jam is playing on the stereo
Checking emails on her phone
She got more hits than the rolling stones

Hell yeah so young and fine
Could she be the one my baby
I'm gonna make her mine
At least for tonight
Hey ya'll I gotta know
Did she get my number maybe
You tell her blow me up
I'm one call away, hell yeah

She's everything that you need
The kinda girl we all dream of
Long legs never stop
Like all those videos in zz topp
She got the stars in her eyes
And she don't mind if you tease her
Can't get her outta my mind
Can't you see she put the freak on me

You know it hurts when she looks so bad
Can't you see you're the best thing I never had
I'm walking out the door before I act like a fool
She's not that cool



He played you sang along
You give you love away baby, and he took it for a song
At the time, you thought it was fair trade
The tune you got now, he can't even play

Me and the old queens drink our ginger and dubonnet
Through my tears, the whole world looks like a Monet
Painted by a master touch
Beautiful but it don't mean much
You should write a song about that
You should write a song about that

All movies now are remakes
We prefer the originals
We're the fans of analogue
In a world that's gone digital
Not much is new
In anything we do or say
And as for music
All the good songs are covers anyway

A table by the window to watch the passing storm
The street is a painting melting , our Sunday in the borne

Me and the old queens drink our ginger and dubonnet
Through my tears, the whole world looks like a Monet
Painted by a master touch
Beautiful but it don't mean much
You should write a song about that
You should write a song about that

Bullet hole stars sprayed across the dawning sky
Light bleeds through so slowly, as we talk of saying goodbye

Me and the old queens drink our ginger and dubonnet
Through my tears, the whole world looks like a Monet
Painted by a master touch
It's beautiful but it don't mean much
You should write a song about that
You should write a song about that



Are you forgetting all the damage that I've done
Are you waiting, contemplating why you changed your mind
Can't push my luck, good ones are getting hard to find

I'm wond'ring now if everything will be the same
I feel so empty knowing I'm the one to blame
And all along I never thought I stood a chance
Those lonely hours, mem'ries of you did enhance

Deep in the night when I need you so
You are the light; I can't let you go
You've been the one from the very start
You've got the power, girl, to change a heart
You've got the power, girl, to change a heart

The timing's right for all our diff'rences to end
We've come so far from all the places that we've been
My heart is telling me that you're my closest friend
It's alright, hold on tight, and do it all again

Deep in the night when I need you so
You are the light; I can't let you go
You've been the one from the very start
You've got the power, girl, to change a heart
You've got the power, girl, to change a heart

Deep in the night when I need you so
You are the light; I can't let you go
You've been the one from the very start
You've got the power, girl, to change a heart
You've got the power, girl, to change a heart



The air is thick with hints of coming rain
Your face flashes through my head I swallow pain
So this is how it feels to be betrayed

This is what it looks like
This is what it feels like
This is what it tastes like
This is what you've done to me
This is what it looks like
This is what it feels like
This is what it tastes like when

You throw this all away Silent
You throw this all away laughing
You throw this all away
You throw this all away

The lake is rough as I sit quietly
Remembering how our life used to be
An angry vacant silence fills my head
Now all the empty promises are dead

This is what it looks like
This is what it feels like
This is what it tastes like
This is what you've done to me
This is what it looks like
This is what it feels like
This is what it tastes like when

You throw this all away Silent
You throw this all away laughing
You throw this all away
You throw this all away

The night is old, the sky a shade of gray
The tears roll off my face die in the rain
An angry vacant silence fills my head
Now all the empty promises are dead

This is what it looks like
This is what it feels like
This is what it tastes like
This is what you've done to me
This is what it looks like
This is what it feels like
This is what it tastes like when

You throw this all away Silent
You throw this all away laughing
You throw this all away
You throw this all away

Good morning Mr President will you sign this grave 
This hole in my pocket is a hole in my face 
A bad heart is a bad surprise 
This black is a fact is a blackened race 

Black is the soul black is the heart 
My bodies unsafe so I fuck on choice 

Shape me shape my friends take them home before they reach 
The honey tree, honey tree 

Souless in form make it meet reach out for that funny me 
One of those three of these 
Education education pieces 

Hand on my heart 
Hand on my soul 
This black is a fact is the back of fools 
I've a face in mind one I can afford 
If I don't then 
I go go go 
To the honey tree, honey tree, honey tree 

The safest place is when I say good bye 
Loving shoulders is a loving mind 
Black is the heart and black is the fool 
Black is the facts is the facts of heart and soul 

In the honey tree 
In the honey tree 
Honey tree x times

Would you say stop for a second
I'll bet you could think for a minute
In the morning light he says, "When will I see you?"
She says, "I don't think tomorrow, baby"
Sometimes I wonder if things would change if we stayed together
Would you change your mind at the very last minute
I think you should stop for a second
Think for a moment

This could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble for you

And the angel said, "Well you must have had a dream"
And you remember it till the dream followed through
Till the end of the dream and the dream came true
When I want something, I get it
"You'd better go," he says, "Yes I think I better,"
Stop for a moment I think you should think for minute
Would you change your mind at the very last minute
When I want something, I get it

Not guilty...have mercy
Oh he says, "You could be my prisoner
Well you're not living in the real world"

You're not my friend...you're not my love
And this is something that we really don't discuss
"Where are you?" sometimes I hear you crying
And I wake up and I get through it



I would change my life for you
Happiness settles where you are

Anytime at all
I would choose to stay with you
Togetherness is not so far
I love you so

That is why, and it's why
I'm ready to sustain
The pleasure and the pain
Oh and all the crazy turns
With you my love

Anything you need
If it raised a smile in you
I want to bring it to your door

Everything I need
In the sleepy sighing
Of somebody here who needs me more
I love you so

That is why, and it's why
I'm ready to sustain
The pleasure and the pain
Oh and all the crazy turns
With you my love

Anytime at all
To stop those lonely tears that fall
And how they made you feel so small
If not me, who you gonna call?

And that is why, it's why
Its why, its why, it's why
I'm ready to sustain
The pleasure and the pain
Oh and all the crazy turns
With you my love

That is why, that is why
I'm ready to sustain
The pleasure and the pain
Oh and all the crazy turns
With you my love

Anytime at all
I would change my life for you
Happiness settles where you are



I'm not listening 
Frail like wretch 
Soft and sinking 
If you could save yourself what would you find? 
Crave the truth 
Like I'm craving mine   

Compensate again 
Black lung is bleeding for you now 
Compensate again 
Black lung is breathing for you now   

Shut your mouth 
It's filling with dust 
Tight like air 
Corroding your trust 
If you could save me now my actions the same 
Line stop dead 
No air in this frame   

Compensate again 
Black lung is bleeding for you now 
Compensate again 
Black lung is breathing for you now

It's my turn to breathe



The respect of the everyman
Seems to have thrown his balance off
And he finds himself hypocritical
Of Hollywood dicks
He finds him self
In cold pursuit

But none of this
Would be so bad
Except for the fact that...

The devotion of thousands
Of fanatical lunatics
A bizarre form of...
Whatever the hell it is
And has shaped him into
A modern day Jack the Ripper
And he finds himself
In cold pursuit

But none of this would be so bad
Except for the fact that
One wit friends who had all that could be
And now it's time to go
And as the blood thickens
The evidence becomes overwhelming
And as the blood thickens
The evidence becomes overwhelming
And he finds himself
In cold pursuit
And none of this
Would be so bad
Except for the fact that...



Oh did you read what I wrote?
Or did you just sit back to tear it up
and prove I was wrong?

And did you smile when you read?
oh did you smile when I said:
That you have a cold heart, cold hands,
and you're a cold, cold disgrace.

And do you roam on your own
oh do you roam on your own
or you had to ask mother, father, brother
for some money again

I will send a little love token
wrap it in my heart and go home

I will send a little love token
wrap it in my heart and go home

You ever think how I might be
When I'm alone and I need
For there's no one home
And you're not reachin' for me

Listen, do you roam on your own
or you go on, on your way 
but you had to ask mother, father, sister
for that money again

Ooh, ooh!

I will send a little love token
wrap it in my heart and go home

I will send a little love token
wrap it in my heart and go home

Read those words you've never heard
Read those words that you've never even heard
An' you're too cool, I bet we'll never see you learn
You should read those word I bet you've never even heard

I will send a little love token
wrap it in my heart and go home

I will send a little love token
wrap it in my heart and go home

I will send a little love token
wrap it in my heart and go home

I will send a little love token
wrap it in my heart and go home



But in reality
Life has never been fun
Working for the bread
Might as well be dead
But life has just begun

Keep in touch with them
Old friends have never been
What I look forward to do
Time was drudgery
Pure insanity
But then I met you

You were what I've been looking for
Now I know what I want to do
Now I got you I'll never leave you
It's true, it's true
New love always feels so good

Can't imagine
How I survived
Without you
It couldn't be done

Feeling confident
Now I always spend
Time just having fun

The first time ever
I know forever
With you, yeah, it feels so good
Now I got you I'll never leave you
It's true, it's true
New love always feels so good

You were what I've been looking for
Now I know what I want to do
Now I got you I'll never leave you
It's true, it's true
New love always feels so good

It's true, it's true
New love always feels so good







Hope you don't mind
I must try to be all I can be
It suits me more
Than it ever suited you
Hope you like the new me

I stole your laugh
So bright and breezy
It stops parties in mid-air
It makes me feel more devil-may-care
Hope you like the new me
Hope you like the new me

We all need friends to lean on
Any time, any place, anywhere
Feel free to lean on me
But please don't do it right now
Yes I'm much too busy right now

I stole your walk
The one with purpoise
That says there is no mountain I can't climb
It fools people all of the time
Hope you like the new me

I stole your jokes
Just the good ones
How the gang all laughed with glee
I also stole
The way that you tell them
Hope you like the new me
Hope you like the new me

To steal is to flatter
What a compliment to pay
All those things that I stole from you
Well I might give them back someday
Yes I really might someday

I stole your wife
Hope you don't mind
She was looking bored don't you think
I'll soon have her back in the pink
Stop by and see us for tea

I stole your soul
When you weren't looking
I reached inside and cut it free
It suits me more
Than it ever suited you
Hope you like the new me
Hope you like the new me



But it gets the best of you, best of you
But you know your mouth is on the edge of a secret
And you make adjustments for cover
But you want to see it through, see it through
And though you're standing all alone now, it's your fault

Your heart is beating faster
And this isn't what you want

Wake me up
You know I can't stand this
I guess I'll try to find a way
To try to forget it
Get over this
Before you

You say thanks for the notion
And even know that this is true, this is true
It's funny how I always hear you say that you're okay
I guess you're keeping it level
I haven't heard from you, heard from you
You're probably living in the past
But it won't last
It won't last

Wake me up
You know I can't stand this
I guess I'll try to find a way
To try to forget it
Get over this
Before you
Up and run away
This is pathetic
You stand uptight
I know you can't help it

Get over this
Control yourself
You're lost and been
Walking forever

Something is wrong something is wrong
What is this voice inside my head?
How can it be?
When all of these things are falling in line?

Wake me up
Wake me up
This is inside your mind

Wake me up
You know I can't stand this
Wake me up
Just try to forget it
Get over this
Control yourself
You're lost and been
Walking forever

Trust me
You.....



We're the most unlikely pair
But up or down, high or low
You've always been right there

You've been a friend to me, a godsend to me
I ain't too proud to say
You've been a friend to me

Now if I'm feeling lowdown
Or feeling ten feet tall
Thick or thin, the shape I'm in
Don't matter to you at all

You've been a friend to me, a godsend to me
I ain't too proud to say
You've been a friend to me

Whenever I needed someone
You're right there on the line
With a friend like you, to get me through
I'll get by every time

Whenever I needed someone
You're right there on the line
With a friend like you, to get me through
I'll get by every time

You've been a friend to me, a godsend to me
I ain't too proud to say
You've been a friend to me



Jesus said it better and He didn't have to shout. 
Maybe if you change it you can get your way. 
Just rearrange it and you can get paid. 

A little more money comes in every day. 
Faith and five dollars goes a long way. 
Look at your pockets filled up with gold 
but what's in your heart is making you cold. 

And it's God Bless you. 
Because it's what you want. 
And all our dreams come true. 
When you get what you want. 

All that I see when you start to cry. 
Is the rock on your finger and gleam in your eye. 
Your sad story is making me sick. 
So change the channel cause it's getting thick. 

Blind accusations is all you can say 
but you'll say anything as long as you're paid. 
Look for their weakness you feed on their need 
but behind your eyes is nothing but greed. 

Why do you lie to make me love you? 
Is it your insecurity? 
Have fun with your selfish ways and misguided thoughts 
cause you will always be...liar.



In Irish industrial schools
Nuns called mothers
And their christian brothers
Kick the shit out of very frightened children

Judges and priests and police and cardinals
They look the other way
When the weekend comes they'll make you suffer

Children in pieces
In Irish industrial schools
Nuns called mothers
And their christian brothers
Kick the shit out of very frightened children

You say you wanna go home
You say you wanna be left alone
And so you turn to me
But instead of sympathy I find
My sentimental heart hardens
My sentimental heart hardens
Get your hands off me
Kid, you must be bad luck
My sentimental heart hardens



Do you know
That this is the end?
I know you are not gonna
Get down on your knees
You're not going to repent
But hey!
You left me with nothing
So there's plenty of things to regret
'Cause I was fighting
I was fighting
I was fighting
But you left me for dead

There was a time
When I saw light in you
There was a time
When it was all about you
But we're not getting closer
We're just getting older
We're gonna perish in the flames

Is it worth it?
Is there anything more I can say?
To make you see that you should see
What it was that you were doing to me
Oh, but everything is different now
And I'm not who I used to be
Well, the change is that I need you
Just as much as you ever needed me

Hey!
There was a time
When I saw light in you
There was a time
When it was all about you
But we're not getting closer
We're just getting older
We're gonna perish in the flames
And until you grasp
What it is that you do
Everyone you need in life
Will fade away from you
'Cause we're not getting closer
You're just getting older
You're gonna perish in the flames

How's the wife?
And are the kids still poison?
Do you still eat them?

Been under the gun
Running the guns
Say how'd this world get so fucking fun
All of a sudden?
All of a sudden?

Here's a quarter for the phone
Why don't you call someone
And find out how it is we can all belong
To something that no one
Wants any part of
One day you'll wake up
And there'll be

Advertising on police cars
And your death will sell you out as someone smart
Somewhat smart
Baby don't get out out of bed
Just lay back down your pretty head
They're advertising on police cars
Police cars
Police cars

Hey, Mr. Chips
Had me a notion
Like a burning sky dropped to the ocean
A bitter pill, is it better still?
To lay undone your guts for show?
To reconstruct some of your bones?
To turn it up?
When it calls to you will you wake up?

They're advertising on police cars
Your death will sell you out as someone smart
Somewhat smart
Baby don't get out of bed
Just lay back down your pretty head
They're advertising on police cars
Police cars
Police cars

Oh, Oh



If you believe that what you've seen will unfold
If you believe that everybody needs to shake it loose
That everyone will rock and everybody will roll, yeah

If you believe everyone is the future
If you believe that nothing ever goes wrong
If you believe that deep down inside you're falling apart
Know that everybody's weak and everyone can be strong

Yeah, believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me

Say what you want
And take the best of me and everyone else
Oh, yeah
Say what you want
It's all the same to me
Look out for yourself

Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me

Say what you want
Ah, ah, la la la la



Are you busy?
Can we meet?
'Cause I feel you
When I breathe
Will you tell me
Should I love you?
Can I save you?
Can I touch you?


And my visions are undeniable
And the words you speak are so undefyable
You're a drug, you're just so incomparable
And you're the only thing I can do
I'm see through


Are you lonely?
Can't you see
That you love me in my dreams?
Will you touch me
When I say to you
That I love you?
I'd burn in Hell for you


And my visions are undeniable
And the words you speak are so undefyable
You're a drug, you're just so incomparable
And you're the only thing I can do
I'm see through


Are you busy?
Can we hum?
'Cause I know you are the one
Will you tell me
Can I love you?
Can I save you?
Can I touch you?


And my visions are undeniable
And the words you speak are so undefyable
You're a drug, you're just so incomparable
And you're the only thing I can do
I'm see through

And my visions are undeniable
So incomparable
Undeniable
I'm see through



Chewin' on surrender because it's cheap and it lasts
This ain't hell, it's a holding tank
Where memory and the future draw a big, fat blank
I know this tunnel leads somewhere
But it takes mystery and a torch
And a reason to care
I know this tunnel leads outside
Down to the river where the elephants die

Comin' up
Up, Up, Up, Up
Comin' Up for Air

There is no better story than a man in a hole
This is where he laid still
This is how he rolled
This is how he fed, on the marrow of his bones
This is where he shuffled
Playin' doomsday alone
A suicide miner
With a depth charge timer
Rathole lover
Diggin' deep for a cover
You suffocate first
Then you learn how to breathe
The sweet of the sewer
Shows you the way to leave

Make room for the cleanup crew
They're the last to the scene
And the first to be fooled
The townsfolk line thick
Along the riverside
Lookin' for a place
To watch the elephants die



Cause I go crazy when you're gone 
You're the one that makes me whole
I pray you've known this all along
Everything is gonna be alright
I wanna be with you all of my life
I can't wait to be alone
With you baby in my arms
Girl I need you here to hold
You know your love it shines like gold
Baby, every minute of the night
That I'm not with you I don't feel right
Cause I only want to be with you
Baby and nobody else
Yes the only girl I see is you
Baby and nobody else
Solo yo no quiero estar
Sin tu carino y tu amor
No quiero vivir sin ti
En mis brazos te quiero asi
Tu eres la unica mujer
Te quiero en mi vida por tu querer
Yes I only want to be with you
Baby and nobody else
Yes the only girl I see is you
Baby and nobody else



I threw a rock 'n' roll party
On my last birthday
Feels good
Rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin'
And I'm havin' fun night and day

Streamline, fleetline
Military brat
I got the general's daughter
Taught her where it was at
I'm rockin'
Rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin'
And I'm havin' fun night and day

I know a gal from Texas
She chili pepper hot
She knows hot to reel it
And knows how to rock
I'm rockin' 
Rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin'
Havin' fun night and day

You know I like to party
And I like to have fun
And like the Killer,
I gotta rock on
Come on!
Rockin' my life away
Movin' and groovin'
I'm havin' fun night and day

You know I like some long
And I like some lean
I like the way
That you shake that thing
I'm rockin'
Rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin'
I'm havin' fun night and day
I got to have it one more time fellas!

From 1492 to 1998
I throw a rock 'n' roll party
On every birthday
I'm rockin'
Rockin' my life away
Said I'm movin' and groovin'
Havin' fun night and day
I'm rockin'
Rockin'
I'm rockin'
Rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin'
I'm gettin' some night and day
I love it!



What's left unsaid is better left unknown.
Maybe we'd be better off alone.
The way we used to feel, it only comes & goes.

It comes & goes.

In the middle of the night I'm pleading.
And I know that you're not really sleeping.
By the half-light of the dawn I'm seething,
Counting every minute until you're leaving.

You come & go.

At least we used to care enough to shout.
Now we'd rather have our peace than have it out.
Uncertainty's been swallowed up by doubt.
I guess this is what my folks were always sighing about.



Blood flowed from Your side
All of God in a young man
Who gave away His life

And You loved me
When I was Your enemy
And You chose me
When I didn't believe

And You drank the cup that was all filled up
With my punishment and shame
From the garden to the empty tomb
The way I come to You forever changed

A crushing burden on our backs
The words hang in the air
"His blood be on us and our children"
Still You forgave us there

And You loved me
When I was Your enemy
And You chose me
When I didn't believe

And You drank the cup that was all filled up
With my punishment and shame
From the garden to the empty tomb
The way I come to You forever changed

Jesus, perfect through suffering
Jesus, my merciful High Priest
The weakness of God is mighty
And the foolishness of His love has saved me

When You drank the cup that was all filled up
With my punishment and shame
From the garden to the empty tomb
The way I come to You forever changed
Forever changed



Pulling me through that open door
Inhibitions dissipate
Now the line's disintegrating
I'm too close to the wire
All strung out on desire

But I'm still there
By your side
On your mind
And in your eyes

The sky's might burn out for you
That's something we'll make true
Regrets beckon like they did before
Pulling me through that open door
Inhibitions dissipate
Now my mind's disintegrating
Tonight something's got to give
Pulling me through that open door
Each breath you must hold sure
And don't abdicate on the good times
Somethings got to give...



It's a long hard road and they will spit you out
When they get through with you
Don't hang your head, so the wise man said, or boy you'll soon be dead

You better run, run Manuela-uela run
They're gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, Manuela run

There's no more time for living out your life, your sky is falling down
Don't close your eyes or make a wish on three
'Cause they will still be 'round
Don't hang your head, so the wise man said, or boy you'll soon be dead

You better run, run Manuela-uela run
They're gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, Manuela run

Don't hang your head, so the wise man said, or boy you'll soon be dead

You better run, run Manuela-uela run, you better run, run Manuela-uela run
You better run, run Manuela-uela run
gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, you better run, run Manuela run
You better run, run Manuela run
gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun
You better run, run Manuela run



Everyone's happy,
Everyone's high.
Get struck by lightning 
Who here would feel it?
Who here could heal it?
Who here would try?


Chemical party, lover down...
It's not the walls, it's not this town.
You're just too high to see the point,
You think your name is 'pass the joint'.

I think I like you,
But you like this whole room,
You sexy machine.
I’m jing-a-linging,
From here to the ceiling.
Inside I’m reeling,
So fresh and so clean.


Chemical party, lover down...
It's not the walls, it's not this town.
You're just too high to see the point,
You think your name is 'pass the joint'.

You're still too amazing to ignore,
But I'm incapable of rescuing you.
You find it too damn easy to get bored,
That's why you're always trying something new.
And then when you can't hold up,
They're all over you,
Flies on cake, flies on cake...


Chemical party, lover down...
It's not the walls, it's not this town.
You're just too high to see the point,
You think your name is 'pass the joint'.

Chemical party, lover down...
It's not the walls, it's not this town.
I'm just too drunk to make my point,
But you think your name is 'pass the joint'.
Oh you think your name is pass the...
Lalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalala



the day is here that wasn't meant to come
she's walking by the frozen sea
trying to count the stars that she can't see

a distant sound of black rain in the water
the pale moon shining soft through a cloud
the sun is turning black in the horizon
the wind is slowly tearing her apart

and so our time has come, my friend
the child who cries and no-one seems to care
the echoes of the birds are gone
the sky is painted grey, but it's so warm

searching for a light in the darkness,
trying to keep your eyes from the dirt
taste the bitter wine of tomorrow
i'm walking on a path that never ends



Feeling like this could only mean I'm sinking
Well, I'm sinking... pull me out

Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floor
I say I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone
Every time I see the light not burning on the porch
I say I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone
But you are, you are

Feeling overwhelmed, I take a dive
To a once overfilled but now empty place to hide
The day you turned on me is the day I died
And I've forgotten what it's like 
And how it feels to be alive

Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floor
I say I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone
Every time I see the light not burning on the porch
I say I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone

I reach up to the sky
When nothing seems to go right
When nothing seems to go right for me

Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floor
I say I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone
Every time I see the light not burning on the porch
I say I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone

I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone
But you are



Right here where you want me, down with the fleas in the floor  

Still you tried to clean me, bleach away like stains 
Blackened ash in your mouth won't distil your distain   

It doesn't matter when you say, I'm not clean anymore 
It doesn't matter when you say, I'm dirty like a whore   

Here is nothing 
For you there is nothing pure



'Cause every night I have the strangest dream
Imprisoned by the way it couldn't be
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone's locked the door and took the key

Ya feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, ya feelin' Alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself

Well boy you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and wonder why
That when I think of you I start to cry
I just can't waste my time I must keep dry 
Got to stop believin' in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die

Ya feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, ya feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself

Don't get too lost in all I say
Like the time I really felt that way
But that was then and now it's today
Can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay
Till' someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name, yes, and a different face

Ya Feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, ya feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself



I'm not afraid of nothing,
'cause heart and soul I'm built for life.

So let the engines roar - Push the pedal down,
I want the white lines on my highway,
To lead me out of town.

I'm rolling on and on and on - Who knows where I'm goin'.

Life is an open road,
It's the best story never told,
It's an endless sky, it's the deepest sea,
Life is an open road to me,
Life is an open road to me.

I got headlights - To guide me through the night,
I got the window down and the radio playing,
It makes me feel alive.

I'm rolling on and on and on - Who knows where I'm goin'.

Life is an open road,
It's the best story never told,
It's an endless sky, it's the deepest sea,
Life is an open road to me,
Life is an open road to me,
Yeah life's an open road.

Life is an open road,
It's the best story never told,
It's an endless sky, it's the deepest sea,
Life is an open road to me,
Life is an open road to me,
Yeah life's an open road - oh yeah.

Yeah I'm built for life,
Life is an open road to me.



Touching you everywhere
Where I've never been before
I can't believe that I
Believe I've finally opened your door

Whispered words to silent ears
They've all been said before
Or will you run and hide so safe inside
Open the door

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Then again nothing kills me
Nothing heals me like you do, like you do
Nothing kills me
Nothing heals me like you do

Angel angel with an attitude
Mend my wings of solitude
And help me fly again
Angel Angel

Sanctify a broken lie
Can you hold the flame
That dares to set alight
Your darkest night
Open the door

Up here in no mans land
Where the moment is so real
I wondered about that star
And where you are. I've opened your door

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Then again nothing kills me
Nothing heals me like you do, like you do
Nothing kills me nothing heals me like you do

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Then again nothing kills me
Nothing heals me like you do, like you do
Nothing kills me nothing heals me like you do

Angel angel with an attitude
Mend my wings of solitude
And help me fly again



Some of these days
I just can't seem to get out of bed
Waking up spider webs growing up in my hair
I've been last; tumbleweeds growin up in my face
It seems just like it's a good time to blast off to space

Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Yeah

Some of these days despite all the things that in my head
Some of the days I love you despite all the shit you said
Tumbleweeds, rolling on rolling on around this town
I'm blasting off; I don't even think I hang around

Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Yeah

Should I leave?
I should have left a long time ago
Should I leave?
I should have left a long time ago
Should I leave?
I should have left a long time ago
Should I leave?
I should have left a long time ago

I just need a spaceship to get me right out of here
I wish I had never met you let you in my stratosphere
Spider webs getting in my brain
I'm the brother that you drove insane
I'm just a kid from the Milky Way
I'm blasting off momma I can't stay

Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I'm an astronaut
Yeah

Get me out of here
Beam me up, beam me up Scotty
Beam me up yeah
Beam me up, beam me up Scotty
Get me out of here

some thing... arrange... always the same
come into the scene... closer... and please smile again
come for a walk... together... in this wasteland

these comforting words i'd want to hear...
i'm only dreaming

this is the moment i was waiting for
i was burning to welcome you into my world
so tired of crossing you path once more
i thought we'd walk the same way after all

the words are yet to come,
and still i feel like silence is meaning so much more
to tell you what's unspoken but remains inside
i feel so quiet i will rise

sometimes... so strange... cut up the pain
these comforting words i'd want you to say...
i'm only craving

in this dream i never had before
the warmth filling me makes me crave for more
the space between us doesn't matter
within this time we spent together

the words are yet to come
and still i feel like silence is meaning so much more
to tell you what's unspoken but remains inside
i feel so quiet i will rise

tonight... you just... cut up the pain
nothing will ever be the same
i'll leave... the scene... but please smile again
thanks for the walk... together... we'll meet again...



You don't live to feed that man
Nothing's gained through self-denial
'Cos you weren't born to be servile 
Don't you know you've gotta
Rise - Think about what you do now
Where do you belong
Are you somebody's niggababe
Or does the fight go on

Do you think the hurting is gonna go away
If you leave uprising for another day

Hey Mister! Better teach your child to run
From all you name as just harmless fun
Do you show respect everywhere you go
Do you teach the young man how to treat your own

Don't you know you've gotta
Rise - Think about what you do now
How do you behave
Would you leave your children
What you see today

Freedom to the children of the world

Think about what you do now
Everything you see
Life aint living in a magazine
Life aint living

Sister! Why do you trade it in
For a diamond chip and a rabbit skin
His big red car is a mote too fast
And it wasn't built for the ride to last

Freedom to the slave of the slave




It helps me remember you
And I recall
How I'm amazed
I still love you the same
Yeah I'm amazed I still love you the same
I still remember
The shape of your hands
The times when you'd walk with me 
And make me laugh
And I'm amazed
At how much we've changed
Yeah I'm amazed
I still love you the same
And each night I see you in my sleep
And I'll always dream that
You're here with me
And I'm amazed
I still love you the same
Yeah I'm amazed I still love you the same
Yeah I'm amazed I still love you the same



Distance fails my feet as our minds think

If you could look in our eyes through the walls
Igniting the fires will be hard to ignore
If you don't act now, you'll never know

I will never walk this far again
We're all so weak broken hearted here

If you could look in our eyes through the walls
Igniting the fires will be hard to ignore
Cause the air is getting tired I can't seem to stay awake
Im tryin to run away
Putting out the flames 
You left us to burn in here
F**k this place, I'm sick of this

It's hard for me to change the lies
When all the hate gets paralyzed

We live in a world
With faith alone
The one thing you seek
To hold the most
Do i go

Do you suffer it

Distance hurts me 
Distance hurts me
Distance hurts me
Distance hurts me

I've never walked so far repeat x7



Of paper
Cryptic signs that i can't read

I'm lost in
This ghost town
I walk alone on freezing streets

Bridge
Aimlessly I roam
Without a ticket home

Shadows on the moon
Bittersweet insomnia
Shadows on the moon
And the rain still falls like shards of glass 
Beneath the northern star
Reflections of a lonesome heart
Shadows on the moon

No promise
No answers
To carry you through dreamless nights

And cracks in
The dark sky
Quietly swallow your cries

You talk to
A stranger
He says you "better not look back" 

Keep crossing 
The wasteland
Before the day breaks

Shadows on the moon
Bittersweet insomnia
Shadows on the moon
And the rain still falls like shards of glass 
Sparkles in the gloom
Shimmering in silver light
Shadows on the moon

Sparkles in the gloom
Shimmering in silver light
Shadows on the moon



I don't know if even Heaven knows
But I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true
And now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl-
There's just not enough love in the world

I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage they can do,
And it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down just like 
Children on a playground
Even after that ol' sun went down

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl
There's just not enough love in the world

Oh darlin', this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile-
For the world, for the camera-
And still have something left
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody
Just take good care of yourself

I'm not easy to live with-
I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, babe
And that's one of the things I loved about you
But a time will come around when we need to settle down
Got to get of this merry-go-round

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking you're light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl
There's just not enough love in the world



Lilly livered son of a ritual gun, cattle for slaughter 
Low life hell, it's all in vein and all's not well 
Inject me life, inject me anything at anytime 
And you fix a smile, it's something new 
And you would sell your fucking soul to have just one more 
Inject a smile, you'll be dead in a little while 
Terraced slum filth dwellings fall, lead in air stunts our fall 
Self inflicted self disgrace, sentenced to an armchair death in outer space 
Cabbage case, squalid little being in an attic mess 
And you will steal my fucking life to have a good time 
I will walk a million miles just to see something truly obscene 
To see a man dead on his feet, to see a woman in junk shop street



A twofaced person is what I'll see
Did you change with time what's wrong with you

My roots has left the ground beneath
I've sold my belongings took back my keys
What will left behind is gone

And tonight the sky's are in disguise
I don't cry wolves just try to get by

So be my saviour, my secret
We'll reunite for a night
'Til there's light it's all right
So be my saviour, my secret
We'll reunite for a night
'Til there's light it's all right

Uh

Is it only water in your veins?
Your spineless behaviour drove me insane
Said you had to leave to achieve
Sunny days are in the air
Still winter winding blows in my hair
If you want to return you turn

'Cause tonight the skies are in disguise
I don't cry wolves just try to get by

So be my saviour, my secret
We'll reunite for a night
'Til there's light it's all right
So be my saviour, my secret
We'll reunite for a night
'Til there's light it's all right

But wherever I look there's the time you took
And I tear your pages from my book
And I'm still waiting for some new dreams to come
And oh I wanna go back home
But tonight the skies are in disguise

Oh

So be my saviour, my secret
We'll reunite for a night
'Til there's light it's all right
So be my saviour, my secret
We'll reunite for a night
'Til there's light it's all right


For a time we can reach back and find what we left behind
And then leave it behind


We can see that it's good to be free
They all let it all be for eternity


I wanna be in the sky but I'm stucked under ground
And I don't want to be tied
Let me fly around


We can see that it's good to be free
They all let it be for eternity

And you're not the one I thought you be



It's just one of those things
I was sitting by myself
And my thoughts started pouring out
Remember that time on our trip
You asked me where we were going
I said Barcelona
You said that's not what I meant
Maybe I'll never get it
I just don't think I'm like that
Don't like planning stuff out
It never happens that way 

I'm like a vacuum bag 
That holds all that old dirt
Remember that time we found your mom's Valium and took it? 

Don't hate me
don't regret me
don't ever forget me
Wherever you go
whatever you do
don't say I never loved you 

That summer when we wore no shoes
And we danced on the Fourth of July
And we listened to your sister's records
And Frampton came alive
Even then you knew what you wanted
Even then I had no clue
I was just living in the moment
And the moment was all about you
Remember that time in LA
You asked me what we were doing
I said we're doing fine
You said here we go again 

I'm like a vacuum bag
That holds all that old dirt
Remember that time we said we'd be together forever? 

Don't hate me
don't regret me
don't ever forget me
Wherever you go
whatever you do
don't say I never loved you 

'Cause it matters to me
Can you hear me?
Everyday I ask the same thing 

Will you ever know what happened to me?
It happens everyday
And you wonder what went on
It's there and then it's gone
Maybe I'm sentimental
And I start to reminisce
And every time I do
I still want to tell you this

Don't hate me
don't regret me
don't ever forget me
Wherever you go
whatever you do
don't say I never loved you

Don't hate me
don't regret me
don't ever forget me
Wherever you go
whatever you do
don't say I never loved you



But I'm feeling what I know and its unexplainable 
And if you could feel that air, run through fields without a care 
And the grass would blow on you well then you would know it too 

But grass dies and night falls and skies cloud to dark 
It seems that its different, but you're near so real so complete 

And the air I breathe, so full, so deep 
Forever so complete, forever so complete 
The air I breathe, so full, so deep 
Forever so complete, forever so complete 

I could take you there, where you could feel that air 
And the worlds could spin around, but it's always, always found 
When you feel that dear run through fields without a care 
And the grass would blow on you and then you would know it too 

But grass dies and night falls and skies cloud to dark 
It seems that its different, but you're near so real so complete 

And the air I breathe, so full, so deep 
Forever so complete, forever so complete 
The air I breathe, so full, so deep 
Forever so complete, forever so complete



They won't carry me home when I cry
Am I too far gone to recover
Or can I return if I try
Should I trade my soul for another
Learn not to complain anymore
Should I stay and pretend that I'm happy
Like so many times before

Yeah these pines are not mine
They don't smeel so sweet
Like the ones in my mind
And I search the needles
'Til I run out of time
But I don't see you in these pines

Do I stumble or falter my words
When I'm saying everything is all right
I'm not one to release my depression
But these trees bring it out every night
Well I don't talk back coz I'm trying to listen
To the wind take me home through these leaves
But it's quiet and I don't hear nothing
Coz the wind doesn't blow through these trees



Efficient and adequate and so simple
So very simple
We were machines, faulty circuitry
Pull the plug, repair the bugs and cover it up
Cover it up
But somewhere in this framework lies
Skinned up knees and broken wires
We all short out in due time
Things will never be the same again
When we were machines, sparkling and pristine
Invincible, untouchable, and so easy
So very easy
We were machines, rusted, obsolete
A number, a statistic
A string of ones and zeroes
Somewhere in this circuitry
Fried out beyond all belief
We all die eventually



Got what he wanted, but not what he needs
Turn it around and it all looks the same
He's half way in, but all the way out
Turn it around what's it all about

Working so hard to find what is true
Everyday it's all I can do
I seem to get lost inside my head
But if it comes from the heart I can't be mislead


Walking through the walls with my eyes half closed
What I feel is all that is real
If I could only clear this haze
And make my way through this maze

Bridge
Yesterday, everything seemed so complete
Yesterday, never nothin' wrong
But today, I'm working twice as hard


Bridge




Will retire to the tide pools
And we'll fix our meals of crabs and krill in the long afternoon
And we'll shed our skin
For a shell from a wise old snail who is singing:

Slow down

At the base of the dunes with the algae bloom and the heron
Here we sit all day and wait and wait for the tide to come crashing
And we'll shed our skin because we know where it's been
And we know this hymn:

Slow down

Lost, lost, in this torrent
Drowned in the deep of this over-sweet porridge
Blind to to all of the blood and carnage

Slow down



By the San Diego Sea 
That was when I was taken in 
And it left its mark on me 
Yeah it nearly drove me crazy 
'Cause I felt I had no choice
Yeah it seemed that I was only marking time 
With all those sailor boys

Louisiana rain is falling at my feet
And I'm noticing a change
As I move down the street
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same
When I reach Baton Rouge

South Carolina put out its arms for me
Right up until everything went black
Somewhere on a lonely street
And I still can't quite remember
Who helped me to my feet
But thank God for this long neck bottle
The angel's remedy

Louisiana rain is falling just like tears
Running down my face
Washing out the years
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same
When I reach Baton Rouge

Well I never will get over
This English refugee
Singing to the Juke Box in some
All-Nite Beanery
Yeah he was eating hard rock candy
And chasing it with tea
You should have seem him lick his lips
When he looked up at me

Louisiana rain is falling at my feet
And I'm noticing a change
As I move down the street
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same
When I reach Baton Rouge



I'll hold on to you but
I cant hold on to this day its all gone
waiting always untouched open
it cam down to save us and end us all
cause im under the outside
and over all
cause im a thousand miles away
and im out of oxygen
and im falling faster than id like to be
and im closer to the sky
than ill ever be to you again
find the exit signs and disappear
we were hated it seems we were all wrong
find me bleeding peacefulness
we looked up to lose our way again
cause im under the outside
and over all
cause im a thousand miles away
and im out of oxygen
and im falling faster than id like to be
and im closer to the sky
than ill ever be to you again
find the exit signs and disappear
somethings dont, somethings dont,
somethings dont, somethings dont,
change
fall
born from angels
lets start this all over again
with the same generation
born from angels
lets start this all over again
with the same declaration
born from angels,
lets start this all over again
with the same generation
it's neon-genesis.



The story of a car chase
And I've become the criminal
And fleeing from the scene being caught in a bad dream
The truth becomes the unthinkable, yeah

I'm on the brink of disaster
Staring down the consequences
To break hard would be better
Tonight I'll do what it takes to fail
I'm going there only faster
Jump the gun and throw it into gear
But the fact of the matter
I'm out of control asleep at the wheel
Asleep at the wheel
Out of control asleep at the wheel

Night falls with no grace
I said I can do anything
But I can do anything wrong
And with burning speed the rearview says it's catching up to me
But I'm already gone

I'm on the brink of disaster
Staring down the consequences
To break hard would be better
Tonight I'll do what it takes to fail
I'm going there only faster
Jump the gun and throw it into gear
But the fact of the matter
I'm out of control asleep at the wheel
Asleep at the wheel

Tearing it down to open up the highway
We're looking for an exit
No pretending
Speeding out and around with a silvering smash
Staring at a car crash oh
The chase is ending

I'm on the brink of disaster
Staring down the consequences
To break hard would be better
Tonight I'll do what it takes to fail
I'm going there only faster
Jump the gun and throw it into gear
But the fact of the matter
The end is coming

I'm on the brink of disaster
Staring down the consequences
To break hard would be better
I'm out of control asleep at the wheel
Asleep at the wheel
Asleep at the wheel
Asleep at the wheel
Out of control asleep at the wheel



Ghost of the wind kocking at my door
Is that you checking on me
Bring the fire to set me free

Chill my body make it cold
Warm me up and let it go
I hear voices in the air
It's too strange no one's ever there

Little drummer play my march
Bring your beat, drown out the dark
Ghosts walking above my grave
The cold washing souls away


Breakdown
And why I question the only questions
I already knew the answers to
So I wish I could count quietly in a crowded room
Till we were only standing there
In another time, another life, another place
And the only thing one could hear
Was the soft whisper of 4, 3, 2



C'mon c'mon c'mon - everything's gonna be alright

The nite is alive - the world is asleep
Dreaming of promises they can't keep
We gotta be tough we gott a be strong
It's only love we've been waiting on

C'mon c'mon c'mon - we're gonna make it home tonight
C'mon c'mon c'mon - everything's gonna be alright

It's only a dream - it's all in your head
It's only some words somebody said
We can believe what we wanna believe
And you can believe in me




Some people think that 
Little girls should be seen
And not heard
But I think, "Oh bondage, up yours!"
1,2,3,4
Bind me tie me 
Chain me to the wall I wanna be a slave 
To you all 
Oh bondage up yours 
Oh bondage no more 
Oh bondage up yours 
Oh bondage no more 
Chain-store chain-smoke 
I consume you all 
Chain-gang chain-mail 
I don't think at all 
Oh bondage up yours 
Oh bondage no more 
Oh bondage up yours 
Oh bondage no more 
Thrash me crash me 
Beat me till I fall 
I wanna be a victim 
For you all 
Oh bondage up yours 
Oh bondage no more 
Oh bondage up yours 
Oh bondage no more 



Oh, yeah

She said that even in the mornin' said you know it's on
Even in the mornin', oh oh oh

Pretty girl come with me
Two on two, three on three
Passion is the flavor climbin' up this tree
Make a fuss, move around
Keep it on the underground
Just beneath the covers, I can see the sea

She knocking knees, so full of pride
She made the move 'cause she's got nothin' to hide
She said that even in the mornin' said you know that it's on
Even in the mornin'

Try to find a place.
We can all belong
Be as one.
Try to get on by.
If we unify
We should really try...

All this time
Spinning round & round.
Made the same mistakes.
That we've always found.
Surely now
We could move along.
Make a better world
No it can't be wrong.

Let's come together,
Right now,
Oh yeah!
In sweet harmony. 2x

Time is running out,
Let there be no doubt,
We should sort things out.
If we care,
Like we say we do.
Not just empty words,
For a week or two.

Make the world,
Your priority.
Try to live your life,
Ecologically.
Play a part,
In a greater scheme.
Try to live the dream,
On a wider scene.

Let's come together,
Right now,
Oh yeah!
In sweet harmony. 3x

Let's come together,
Right now,
Oh yeah!

Haaa

Let's come together,
Right now,
Oh yeah!

Let's come together,
Right now,
Oh yeah!
In sweet harmony 3x

Let's come together,
Right now,
Oh yeah!



Out goes ego on the first mistake
Out goes ego on the tide
This one's waiting for his mother's love
And up jumps mother valentine valentine

Too many compose a shame
And I hear voices like Abraham
This is your papa wrapped up in time
This is your mama in valentines
In valentines
In valentines
Valentines
Valentines

This is your mama crawling back into the sack valentine
This is your papa singing "find another dad" valentine
This is your mama singing "that's no lie" valentine
This is your papa come to send them both away

I want to sleep, I want to slide
I want to reel in the space from either side
I'm on a roll, I'm on a ride
I'm only waiting for mother valentine

Out goes ego on the first mistake
Out goes ego on the tide
This one's waiting for his mother's love
And up jumps mother valentine valentine

This is your mama crawling back into the sack valentine
This is your papa singing "find another dad" valentine
This is your mama singing "that's no lie" valentine
This is your papa come to send them all away
All away, all away, all away

God bless this miracle
God bless eternity
God bless you and me



I came upon a burning bush.
"What wants you vision?", says I
And it spoke, and I quote,

"Apocalypse can go down easy
You gotta know it's an acquired taste.
You're sacrifice can't please me
I'm dead set to destroy this place.
Hip hip for imperfection,
I want to make a mess.
I've got a secret theory
That disarray works best
And though it don't work often
Oh my God when it does-
Watch as the outburst softens
It's had its way with us.

They're scared of the silence
But be scared-er of the sound.
Hearts are not only beating
They are all counting down.
You're not ready for disorder.
You're not ready for decay.
Have you been staving 
Time and aging
Sloughing dead skin away?

I must confess I said with a smile,
"I'm frightened as a child.
And I suspect by 
The smoke in your eye
You're thinking 'So am I.'

Apocalypse can go down easy
You gotta know it's an acquired taste.
Our sacrifice can't please thee
You're dead set to destroy this place.
If the aspirin you take 
Doesn't cure your headache
Why do docs propose 
The headache's in your head?
And if the orgasms we fake
Take their toll and take the cake
Why do they suppose
We're better off in bed?

And then the bush said,
"You and I, we were meant to be together.
You and I, we are gonna hang together.
You and I, we are going down together."



My shell on top of your knotty fist with a speculum shoved up my cunt, after hours. 

Take solace my love in the little things: red droplets wet eyelashes and money.
That's the way it goes. I shot my baby. It has to be love. 

For one lousy minute she felt like a queen. 

I stand here naked at attention.
Is this my only skill?
I fucked my first fruit today, lousy lay.
I asked my daddy for a quarter,
He gave me twenty-five cents and a kiss for good luck. 

Daddy, what can I do to make you stop crying?
I been wanderin' the canned fruit aisle wondering what I can do to make you smile.
Jesus only knows. 

In time I'll grow to big and old to help you with your strange hurt.
But right now I'm a school girl learning exactly what I was put on this earth for. 

For one lousy minute she felt like a queen. 

Should the smart little girl tell a story or a lie,
With her eyes on the toy she's a tomboy in the mirror.
Watch her as she changes. See how she grows.
Her cells are re-arrangin'. She'll need a woman's clothes.
What are these ugly changes?
Jesus only knows... 

I stand here naked at attention.
Is this my only skill?
I fucked my first fruit today, lousy lay.
I asked my daddy for a quarter,
He gave me twenty-five cents and a kiss for good luck.



And I feel love, inside my body
After school I think I'll call you
I've been rude ever since I saw you

Another feeling that draws me to you

Just hold on and take it all in

We're gunna fuck non stop

You're fucking beautiful



Frontiers drawn on paper, no consideration made for
The poor creature who is living by the grace of God, just giving
He's live on network news, live on network news

Flags, princes, kings, patriotic fools
As freedom lies in twisted heaps whose final breath his soul to keep
Whose greatest foe, the endless sleep whose dying wish to reach next week
A bloody star on the network news, a bloody star on the network news

Oh yeah

Tanks, boats and planes, fire, pain and lies
Environmental terrorists tease propaganda's paper fist
Whose trade is all the truth that fits, who often lies but never sits
But on the fence it's the network news, yes on the fence it's network news

Hallelujah, hallelujah, oil, oil
Hallelujah, hallelujah, oil, oil
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

The lion and the serpent parade out in the sun, all order flex and gesture
All hail the techno infidel has come with satellite bravado and infra-red texture
Beyond these days in time to come, whose fate is it to measure
Upon these sands such damage done to spoil God's finest treasure

Oh, beyond these days in time to come, whose fate is it to measure
Upon these sands such damage done to spoil God's finest treasure
Hallelujah, hallelujah ... oil oil
Hallelujah, hallelujah ... oil oil

Beyond these days in time to come
Oh, whose fate is it to measure Ohh
Beyond these days in time to come Who, oh, who is it to measure, oh
Hallelujah, hallelujah Guns death and noise
Sand oil and blood Guns death and noise
Sand oil and blood



One among the hundreds, crying for the millions
And when the house lights break the trance
Only then unclasp our hands
Compose ourselves and fix our hair
"We would have all been Schindler there"
Drive in silence slowly home
Now horror's more than skin and bone 

And can you see in twenty years
We'll pay to shed the same cheap tears
In a film about an island, watch our hero take a stand
Pay our money gladly to wash our hands 

Watching the movie we'll ask how the people might have known
Let it happen there without a fight
Kept driving on quietly home
Left the Timorese alone - 400 miles from Darwin 

The two-minute hate is now the three-hour love
With any action left to up above
Those people then could turn their heads
Now all the same we sleep instead
While 400 miles from Darwin
East Timor is dying 

Watching the movie we'll ask how the people might have known
Let it happen there without a fight
Kept driving on quietly home
Left the Timorese alone - 400 miles from Darwin

I found my sweet delta blues,
She weaved a little Southern spell on me,
Made a little voodoo.

She was born the bright side of midnight,
When her mama was seventeen,
She was a hot blooded - God fearin' - Gospel girl,
The finest that I ever seen - Oh.

She's black coffee - Little bit of cream,
Sweet brown sugar - My midnight dream.

Black pearl - Yeah my kinda girl,
Just the kind of thing to rock my world,
Black pearl - Oh my kinda girl - Yeah.

Met her in a dixie diner,
Put on the Southern hospitality,
I can still smell her sweet molasses,
Running all over me.

We started rollin' like the river,
Like a twister tearin' through the town,
Tongue tied - satisfied - 'n Southern fried,
As she drove this ol' dixie down.

She's black coffee - Little bit of cream,
Sweet brown sugar - My midnight dream.

Black pearl - My kinda girl,
Just the kind of thing to rock my world,
Black pearl - She's my kinda girl - Yeah.

Yeah - She's alright - Yeah - She's ok,
Makin' love night - Yeah - Really made my day.

She was born the bright side of midnight,
When her mama was seventeen - Yeah,
She was a hot blooded - God fearin' - Gospel girl,
The finest that I ever seen - Yeah baby.

She's black coffee - Little bit of cream,
Sweet brown sugar - My midnight dream.

Hey, hey.

Black pearl - My kinda girl,
Just the kind of thing to rock my world,
Black pearl - Oh my kinda girl.

Read it off one sentence at a time
I'm tired of all the lines, convictions and your lies
What right do you have to point at me?

Well, I'm sitting alone thinking about it all over coffee
And still crowding my space are the things you still hold against me
You cannot save me.

Well, it's not the time to breakdown
It's not the time to breakdown
It's not the time to break up this love
Keep it together now
Well, It's not the time to break

Read it all, no need for separating it
You see what you want and try to justify
All your little lines, convictions and your lies
What right do you have to point at me?

Well, I'm sitting alone thinking about it all over coffee
And still crowding my space are the things you still hold against me
You cannot save me

Well, it's not the time to breakdown
It's not the time to breakdown
It's not the time to break up this love
Keep it together now
Well, It's not the time to break

Open up the book you beat me with again
Read it off one sentence at a time

Well, it's not the time to breakdown
Well, it's not the time to breakdown
Well, it's not the time to breakdown
Well, it's not the time to breakdown
Well, it's not the time to breakdown
Well, it's not the time to break up this love
Keep it together now
Well, it's not the time to break
Breakdown



Such a mystery to me
Somehow you always like to play undercover
It's your path to discover
Roll me like we're tumbling dice 
A wrecking ball rag doll ain't no breathing space
All the tapes have been erased
Prize fighter taking all the punches he can stand
And dropping on command
All my dreams are trying to come true
But all I ever wanted was you

What you don't understand
Forget the master plan
I'd give it all away to have you back again
I said it in my letter
So we could make it better
No need for you to read between the lines
Baby can I be your baby
Definitely maybe won't do 

Ruby red play dead they don't make a sound
Plastic soldiers in a row
You're shouting calling all destroyers what to do
They're coming after you
Surrender but the battle is won 

She thought of cars where to drive trying to survive
How to make the great escape
Still watching life on other planets fall apart
She wears it on her heart
All my dreams are trying to come true
But all I ever wanted was you 

Someday you'll see
All our worlds collide
Way out in space







sit in a horsechair resteless chair
and put on my wost clothes
I roll myself up in the ash and the dirt
on my floor buried inside
the soft centre of my hearts desire
I'll finish my food and I'll be stray
the soft shots through me have passed away

I trust it up with one hand
yeah and I pulled it down
well I built it up I pulled it down
left hand, right hand
right man - wrong man

I held you crossly
put a finger in your blue eyes
my faraway beloved one
with her starry faith, she keeps me afloat
yean and she could sink with just one stroke
my love she's a prue heartred girl
I'm just a young boy in her mind
You're just a neck to ankle dress
and sexlessness
put a finger in your blue eyes

I built it up with one hand
yeah and I pulled it down
well I built it up I pulled it down
left hand, right hand
right man - wrong man

the girls under heel
and she plays her sad music
a lit match beneath my heel
says lay down the past
and shed taht skin
and we'll have no history
and you'll still hold your mystery
lay back now beloved one
you swing around in a wing
you open up and sing

your horsehour restless jacket
leaves you senseless
he sut his eyes
lets the silence do the rest

well I built it up with one hand
yeah and I pulled it down
I built it up I pulled it down
left hand, right hand
right man - wrong man



You're outta there, you're gone
Fare thee well, you're takin' me off
Easier from there, so darned well
Fare thee well, go on
Once you're there, don't fall
Fare thee well, you're pickin' it up easier
From there, do tell

No one ever hoped you'd ever fumble around
Without your new jeans on, the kind that button down
When you choose to float before your paddles broke
Then you don't come cryin' to me no more

Fare thee well, long gone
How you cared, so what
Fare thee well, there's somethin' to be said
For being there a short spell

No one ever hoped you'd ever fumble around
Without your new jeans on, the kind that button down
When you choose to float before your paddles broke
Then you don't come cryin' to me no more



Before you drove that thing at all
Dragging you out might have I've been bad
He may be your pal but he ain't no dad

Never met you
Care, I still do
Watch as it nears
Clench my teeth
And fight back tears
Should have left you alone
They still brought you along
You think they'd know right from wrong

It's all you want and it makes sense
But at your age seems too intense
They call you names, just because
You don't deserve that, no one does

When it crashes down
I hope that you're not around
Why they thought that's okay
It's far beyond me to say
Not much better at all
They should leave you alone
I think that kind of fun
Is not for father and son







You gotta believe in something 
And haven't you heard that nothing brings me down? 
We started the same 
And how does it feel to know how? 
The feeling inside is gone, now I will wait 
Backing up is gonna hurt yourself 
But I will wait 
Your destination's gonna kill yourself 
But I'll have faith 
This way you're confident 
Now that you're facing it 
You used to fear the pain you had 
You'll take it by the hand instead 
So take me now 
You'll have your time to notice me 
And everything is real 
I have to decide if leaving myself is worth it 
The only thing left to know is time will tell 
I'm kind of afraid you're turning me into something 
You're telling me now that I am waking up 
You're breaking up, you're gonna hurt yourself 
In time you'll die 
You're facing up, you gotta save yourself 
You know it's right 
Let's leave the way we used to be 
It's time to fall in love 
I'm not afraid to see the end



She smiles and veins turn to ice
She smiles and heads bow down
She works the room
Air-kisses every victim twice
She spreads her joy around

Do you close your eyes to see miracles
Do you raise your face to kiss angels
Do you float on air to hear oracles
Bathsheba smiles, smiles
Bathsheba smiles, smiles
No doubt can cross her mind
Cross her mind

Bathsheba knows
She knows you better than yourself
Confess it on your knees
She shares her love
And sharing love is sharing wealth
Dig in your pockets please

Do you close your eyes to see miracles
Do you raise your face to kiss angels
Do you float on air to hear oracles
Bathsheba smiles, smiles
Bathsheba smiles, smiles
No doubt can cross her mind

No pain no gain's a strain
But she never seems to hurt
Catwalk pilgrims sing this song
Hello heaven, goodbye dirt
And no hair shirt

Do you close your eyes to see miracles
Do you raise your face to kiss angels
Do you float on air to hear oracles
Bathsheba smiles, smiles
Bathsheba smiles, smiles
No doubt can cross her mind

Do you close your eyes
Do you raise your face
Bathsheba smiles, smiles
Bathsheba smiles, smiles
Bathsheba smiles



Letters still unopened in a home that's not a home 
Ain't nothing going to ever change that 
The writings on the wall in words I never wrote 
Could it be my lies after all 


Staring in the mirror at these patterns of odd 
Taking after your mother another should have been 
Ending up like superman in the closet 
Unable to come out 


Just one more game where someone has to lose 
Just one more way to separate the truth 
Just one more line they already used 
Just one more me 
Pretending to be you 

Hiding in the television again 
Looking for anyone to turn you on 
Caught on film by a stranger's eye 
Just another place I don't belong 


Breaking mirrors of there patterns of odd 
Blaming your father for who you really are 
Placing ads for heroes cause you can't save yourself 


Just one more game where someone has to lose 
Just one more way to separate the truth 
Just one more line they already used 
Just one more me 
Pretending to be you



You listen to what you've got
You listen to what you've got 
And then you realise that it's nothing

You listen to what you've got
You listen to what you've got

No

What's in these bad dreams?
And I know your coming backwards
What's in these bad dreams?
You might as well be talking backwards
What's in these bad dreams?
And I know your coming backwards

You might as well be talking to yourself

And what you've got
You listen to what you've got

up above the clouds, it is always a blue sky
some will try a trick, but you just look them in the eyes
what will they do, when the money runs dry?
where will they go, when the jet planes can't fly?

when all is said and done i will love you
when all is said and done i'll still love you

starring out at the stars, you feel helpless and so small
nothing but closed down bars, no one helps you when you fall
one day this world will be returning to this prime
we'll all be gone, there'll  be no more roads to find

when all is said and done i will love you
when all is said and done i'll still love you

the rain came again, 
cleaning the dream and it always makes me cry, oh my
something about the rain, it sends memories through my vains
memories always stain, you can't wash them down the drain
where will i go when my broken body dies?
and what will i know when i look up to the skies?

when all is said and done will you love me? x2

the rain came again, cleaning the dream
and it always makes me cry, oh my
up above the clouds, it is always a blue sky



i've been begging for a single moment

tired of living life through the rearview mirror

we can make this right

now i'm coming away with what i wanted to say
now i'm left with the words never spoken
if i could go back in time
if i could only rewind

Damned if you feel alright
Loafing and free, it's the same way every night

And if you think you amaze like the dumb every
Other, fool but never go outside
When will You see that you can't ever run and hide

And everybody's looking at the silly people
Living silly lives
Laying all around incessantly oh yeah
And if you're hearing all those little people
Telling little lies
It's time to live it's time to get a life oh yeah

Day turn to week and the week to year
You can't ever can't hold on
Nothing to be is a sad way to go along

And if the prize of the win is the size of the sin
But you'll never win that way
Nothing to be is a shame every other day

And everybody's looking at the silly people
Living silly lives
Laying all around incessantly oh yeah
And if you're hearing all those little people
Telling little lies
It's time to live it's time to get a life

Carry on, yeah, if you wanna think of nothing
Well then you'll be so nothing that you'll
Never know what you're not yeah

And everybody's looking at the silly people
Living silly lives
Laying all around incessantly oh yeah
And if you're hearing all those little people
Telling little lies
I's time to live it's time to get a life



Your only rivers run cold
These city lights
They shine as silver and gold
Dug from the night
Your eyes as black as coal

Walk on by, walk on through
Walk till you run and don't look back
For here I am

Carnival
The wheels fly and the colours spin
Through alcohol
Red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face
In a dry and waterless place

Walk on by, walk on through
So sad to besiege your love
Oh, hang on

Stay this time
Stay tonight in a lie
I'm only asking
But I, I think you know
Come on take me away
Come on take me away
Come on take me home
Home again

And if the mountains should crumble
Or disappear into the sea
Not a tear, no, not I

Stay this time
Stay tonight in a lie
Ever after is a long time
And if you save your love
Save it all, save it all
Don't push me too far
Don't push me too far
Tonight, tonight



Of yesterday I could not hide
We can make it, if we only try
We can make it.

And there you are in perfect time
You're standing still
You're hands in mine
And I love you for who you are
And I love you, just how you are

You are, you are the only one for me
And you are, you are the only one for me
I tried for years to get this right
And I'm not about to lose this fight.
To lose this fight

The longest mile I'll walk with you
If your sky falls I'll pull you through
And I love you, for who you are.
And I love you, stay who you are.

You are, you are the only one for me
And you are, you are the only one for me
I tried for years to get this right
And I'm not about to lose this...

I don't have to write it down
I know that you'll be around
When the days are long the loves goes on
And everything that has gone wrong
Is brought into the light

You are, you are the only one for me
And you are, you are the only one for me
I tried for years to get this right
And I'm not about to lose this fight.
To lose this fight







Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong but you already know
Believe me I won't stop at nothin' 
To see you so I've started runnin'

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time
Oh why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you God knows what I'd do

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you



Framed to be consumed
Savory
Savoring your sympathy

Hey angel, fly over and bless me
See you feign surprise
That I'm all eyes
And you're all you need to be

Hey angel, whatever position
We consider fit to put you in
You'll protest your complicity

Easy now

One hand will wash the other
One hand will wash the other

Hey angel, fly over and bless me
See you feign surprise
But I'm all eyes
And we're all we need to be, need to be

Easy now

One hand will wash the other
One hand will wash the other



I'll wake you t the first sign of light,
If you make sure you sleep well tonight.

Take care, stay with us,
All you've seen has gone,
If you dream the truth will all come clear.

Put me up just to make a stand.

If you could take a lifetime away,
And make me come back down,
If you could take the hours then,
Maybe we could fall apart,
I could stay the same.

Sleep well tonight,
I'll wake you t the first sign of light,
If you make sure you sleep well tonight.

We fell like everyone else has,
Our mark,
Will show where we were for our last time.

We'll carve the mark to remember this.

If we could take a lifetime away,
And make us come back down,
If you could take the hours then,
Maybe we could fall apart,
I could stay here.

Sleep well tonight,
Sleep well tonight.

If we could take away the summit,
We could climb the highest we've ever been to,
If you could take away the summit.



Too dark to find my way home
Black rain from a clear blue sky 
Feel cold - my heart is frozen
Black dress on a wedding day
Church stands all deserted 
I've tried to find 
Some brighter note
Inside my mind
I finally wrote

A black symphony
When darkness steals the light from day
Black symphony
And all my colours fade away
It overshadows my whole life
This broken melody 
Black symphony

Black leaves on a florid tree
No birds - silent springtime
Black tears in a smiling face
No one who would dry them
Black tones in a lullaby
So strange - it makes me shiver
I've tried to find 
Some brighter note
Inside my mind
I finally wrote

A black symphony
When darkness steals the light from day
Black symphony
And all my colours fade away
It overshadows my whole life
This broken melody
Black symphony

Since you've been gone
This house is not a home
I raise my head up to the sky
Look for a sign it helps me by
My hope remains
One day I will erase...

A black symphony
When darkness steals the light from day
Black symphony
And all my colours fade away
It overshadows my whole life
This broken melody
Black symphony



you've tried to erase?
but you're feeling high you're feeling low
but it still remains
feels the time is near
have got to let is go
and open up my heart again
cause hate is all you show
and i just wanted to feel all the love
that you hold inside
never let it escape
all the love that you hold inside
you keep pushing me away
with all the love that you hold
inside
how long can i run?
run from the past?
it's the pain that takes to burn a whole
right trough my chest
to say that you love me
will make you feel weak
it's easier for you to hate
cause your love is like a breeze-oh
and i just wanted to feel all the love
that you hold inside
you never let it escape
with all the love that you hold inside
you keep pushing me away
with all the love that you hold
inside
you hol-old
inside
that you hold inside
you never let it escape
all the love that you hold inside
you never let it escape
all the love that you hold inside
you keep pushing me away
with all the love that you hold inside
hold inside
that you hold inside
hold inside



Feelin' mistakes that are fake
Makin' excuses like imaginary friends run away
To where I've already been
To where I already am
So tell me tell me it'll work out so I'll be wrong again
I look inside I'm surprised at what I see in my eyes
So tell me tell me was I there when I was taught how to lie?
I thought I'd chase paradise but Ill just set off a lie
So tell me tell me did I die when I was taught how to lie?
Don't tell me what it'll be because it's all in degrees
And by degrees what I mean is you dont see what I see
So is this falling apart or are these pieces of me?
Is this a nightmare to be or am I building a dream?

When did this come to be?
When did things pick up speed?
Tyin' down my living needs
Tyin' down my living needs
Oh ohh
Don't know why don't know why
Don't know why don't know why
Don't know why I am here
All that I've forgotten is only stoppin to remind me
Only I Only I
Know that I Know that I
Only I can be my only
Odd sacrifice
I suffered twice and all that I did
Was be...

Its funny how life can be the circles that surround me
Drawing a reminder of what I've done and who I've become
Sleepin' my days without dreams, Wakin' at night without sleep
Missing the truth to lie the promises I heard I would keep
Im lost in my paradise, the walls have built in my life
So tell me tell me will I die if I forget how to lie?

When did this come to be?
When did things pick up speed?
Tyin' down my living needs
Tyin' down my living needs
Oh ohh
Don't know why Don't know why
Don't know why Don't know why
Don't know why I am here
All that Ive forgotton is only stoppin to remind me
Only I Only I
Know that I Know that I
Only I can be my only
Odd sacrifice
I suffered twice and all that I did
Was be...



It will no longer be necessary
And no more will I say, dear heart
I am alone and she has left me

And no more shall we part
The contracts are drawn up,
The ring is locked upon the finger
And never again will my letters start
Sadly, or in the depths of winter

And no more shall we part
All the hatchets have been buried now
And all of birds will sing to your
beautiful heart
Upon the bough

And no more shall we part
Your chain of command
Has been silenced now
And all of those birds
Would've sung to your beautiful heart
Anyhow

Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I will never be free
If I'm not free now

Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I never was free
What are you talking about?

For no more shall we part
And no more shall we part



Oh the jets ain't jumpin' 'cos the
Cloud's too low
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
The ice on the window
The highways I see
Who do you love
Is it her or is it me?
I wanna know

I called Detroit City on the telephone
The girl on the line told me you ain't home
I wanna know
Who's that voice
Oh tell it Babe
There's a deep red glow in the early mornin' sky
Who do you love
Better make up your mind

Don't wanna try love
I just want your love Babe

I called five in the mornin'
And the place is dead
Gonna rest my body on an empty bed
I gotta know
What's her name Baby
What's your game

Make up your mind
Are you hers or are you mine
When you get back I'll ask you one more time.



My heart is gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Didn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel left all alone
Take me to your... heart
Feel me in your.... bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this long and winding road...

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

I guess that I seem
To make romantic dreams
Up in lights
Fallin' off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing... keeps me
Together at the seams
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home...

It's a bittersweet,
Symphony
This life.
Just tryin' to make ends meet.
You're a slave to the money,
Then you die.
There's no change...
I can't change,
I can't change,
I can't change.
But I'm here in my mind
I'm here in my mind
I'm a million different people from one
Day to the next
I can't change
My mind
No, no, no

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home...



Coz you'll tell me anything I wanna hear
And it don't mean nothing when you laugh at my jokes
Coz its all or nothing when I fall apart
Fade fade fade into you

You're under my skin now I could shut out the world that we know
I'll try to be everything you want me to be
And I've got a head start but I'm making the same mistakes
And its all or nothing when we fall apart
Fade fade fade into you

Caught in the rush of the crowd
Lost in a wall of sound
You were ringing in my ear
Caught in the rush of the crowd
Lost in a wall of sound
You were ringing in my ear

Fade fade fade fade

Caught in the rush of the crowd
Lost in a wall of sound
You were ringing in my ear
Caught in the rush of the crowd
Lost in a wall of sound
You were ringing in my ear



In my time of feeling bad
Oh what I'd give
Just to relive
All of the good times that I've had.

In my time of sorrow
In my time of feeling alone
There was a time
I could ease my mind
With thoughts of just being on my own.

Changes of life
I'm going through
Keep me from doing
What I know I should do.

In my time of sorrow
In my time where teardrops fall
I can't tell you why
I don't want to try,
But the time has come
For me to say fare well.

In my time of sorrow
In my time of sorrow
In my time of sorrow...



I'm no good at understanding, but I'm good at standing ground.
And when I asked a corner preacher I couldn't hear him for my
youth. Some people get religion some people get the truth. I
never get the truth, I never get the truth.

I know the darkness pulls on you. And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
heart can break in two, someone loves you.

I lay this suitcase on my chest so I can feel somebody's weight.
And I lay you to rest just to feel a give and take?
I got a new interpretation and it's a better point of view, you
were looking for a landslide I was looking out for you, I was
looking out for you, someone's looking out for you

I know the darkness pulls on you. And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
heart can break in two, someone loves you.

I am afraid of crossing lines. I am afraid of flying blind.
Afraid of inquiring minds. Afraid of being left behind.

I close my eyes I think of you, I take a step I think of you,
I catch my breath I think of you, I cannot rest I think of you

My one and only wrecking ball, and you're crashing through my
walls. When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and
when you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like
your heart could break in two, someone loves you.



spend my life wishing it won't be long 
everything I do just seems a waist 
waiting for the day

Monday morning comes around to soon 
everyone I look at knows it's true 
shadows of my days I've left them all 
waiting for the day

the gold you gave me didn't wash to well 
the silver soon shone through 
to the opposite reversal 
my first rate friend 
for me won't ever do

voices said to me when you going to choose 
it's a waist of time waiting with nothing to loose 
got to think everyday is going to be your last 
waiting for the day

watched you getting old, watched you getting scared 
I put my arms out for ya but no one cared 
I saved my emphasitions and my fear in love 
waiting for the day

the gold you gave me didn't wash to well 
the silver soon shone through 
to the opposite reversal 
my first rate friend 
for me won't ever do

don't want to leave you out 
I should have never shout



Give me now
Give me now
Give me now
Give me now
Give me a way
Give me a fucking reason
A reason I should stay

Built for business or for pleasure
Any way you choose
It doesn't matter how or why
'Cause either way, you lose

Give me now
Give me now
Give me now
Give me now
Give me now
Give me a way
Give me a fucking reason
A reason I should stay

Built for business or for pleasure
Any way you choose
It doesn't matter how or why
'Cause either way, you lose

Yeah, yeah



The clock strikes twelve
It feels so soon

Two o'clock, three kicks inFour o'clock
That's when I begin, oh yeah

Through the doors
Through the halls
Down the elevator
To the second floor

Across the bar
In a thin green dress
I catch your smile
And then I said oh God
It's not my bedtime story
Or sience fiction
It's just a matter of fact
If I fall to temptation
It's my decision to turn back
Oh yes, with open eyes in the dark
Oh yeah, we come together
We come together

Soul to soul, I found a love
Soul to soul to soul
Soul to soul to soul, she's got a Gucci love
Soul to soul to soul

Moonswept alibis
Sleepin' away the night
As you and I walk alone
Hand and hand
We cast shadows of love
There's a good thing goin' on
With open eyes
We come together
We come together

It's our song
We sing alone
It's our song
We sing of love

She's got this feelin'
That I can't get enough
It's like strawberry jelly
It's a tough too much
I gotta expert timing
She's skin slappin' love
I can tell you something child
I loose control



Sunken subterranean eyes
It was another chance for me to do right
And another one of those chances just passed me by

Won't even try to make it to your house
These people they ain't ever gonna lock me out

I'm gonna lay me down
In some dark and secluded town
Burn into the eversetting sun

I'm gonna lay me down
In some dark and secluded town
Burn into the eversetting sun

Well now you're on your own

Evil eyes on me
They play their evil games all night
And it has gone on for a century
I'm beginning to think I'm wrong and that they are right

They're invisible to so much they try to hide
They only show when they flash their ugly sight

I'm gonna lay me down
In some dark and secluded town
Burn into the eversetting sun

I'm gonna lay me down
In some dark and secluded town
Burn into the eversetting sun

Well now you're on your own

Subterranean nightmare
Sunken subterranean eyes
I ain't going anywhere

Won't even try to make it to your house
None of them ain't ever gonna lock me out
None of them ain't ever gonna let me go
I was a fool to think I could come here alone
I just had to go all night long

I'm gonna lay me down
In some dark and secluded town
Burn into the eversetting sun

I'm gonna lay me down
In some dark and secluded town
Burn into the eversetting sun

I'm gonna lay me down
In some dark and secluded town
Burn into the eversetting sun

I'm gonna lay me down
In some dark and secluded town
Burn into the eversetting sun

Oh well now you're on your own



I never took the time, or paid it any mind
It didn't matter win or lose
Ever since I met you things have changed
Cloudy skies have brighter days
Even fate has turned my way
I know that I would be a fool, not to bet it all on you
And let the chips fall where they may

And now I'm the lucky one
I'll always be the lucky one
As long as you are close to me
Like a gambling man who always holds a winning hand
Losing's just a thought I can't conceive
The worlds a better place, one look at you is all it takes
And I surrender willingly
And now I'm the lucky one
I'll always be the lucky one
Since I have you close to me

Lovers take their vous
Many times I've wondered how
Say those words so easily
Did that happiness, hide their loneliness
With the things I couldn't see
I may never understand
What would make a man
Think he found the one he needs
But I don't question why,
I just believe that I, found a love that's meant to be

And now I'm the lucky one
I'll always be the lucky one
As long as you are close to me
Like a gambling man who always holds a winning hand
Losing's just a thought I can't conceive
The worlds a better place, one look at you is all it takes
And I surrender willingly
And now I'm the lucky one
I'll always be the lucky one
Since I have you close to me

Now I'm the lucky one
I know that I'm the lucky one
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Like a gambling man who always holds a winning hand
Losing's just a thought I can't conceive
I'm the lucky one
And I surrender willingly
I'm the lucky one
As long as you are close to me...



The sky runs by while the days are gone
The night falls prey to another sun
All like clockwork they won't stop
They won't stop

Don't stand still, all the leaves are grown
The world keeps spinning just to wear us down
Say what you must while we're still around
The days go to sleep but they won't stop
They won't stop

We never should allow another sun to set
On all the words that we have held so long
I know we'd rather sort it out once tomorrow comes
But tomorrow already happened

Time is a thief with a loaded gun
The sky runs by while the days are gone
The night falls prey to another sun
The days go to sleep but they won't stop, no

We never should allow another sun to set
On all the words that we have held so long
I know we'd rather sort it out once tomorrow comes
But tomorrow already happened
Tomorrow

We can wait for the sunrise
To say what should matter
We'll know by tomorrow
But tomorrow, tomorrow just happened

Today we need to make the most of love
Tomorrow we don't have a choice
All we ever get control of is now

I know we'd rather sort it out once tomorrow comes
But tomorrow already happened
Woah

I know we'd rather sort it out once tomorrow comes
But tomorrow already happened



Free your soul
Out of time
And out of control

You get caught up
All the time
On your way
See the sign

Over and over
You push your luck
Every time
Never enough

You get caught up
All the time
Going down
See the sign



You've got a whole lot of trouble
Running in your veins
Say it right here and right now
You give drugs a bad name
So why just hit him
When you can hang him high
Why just make them sweat
When you can watch them die
If you'd have faced the world
You could have had it all
Now your back's up against
That same damn dirty wall
Every place you live
Turns out the same
You passed your last buck
You give drugs a bad name
You give drives a bad name
You give drugs a bad name baby
Yeah yeah
Now a cool person knows
When the party ends
Besides some of us just might wanna be
invited back here again
So pick yourself up off that bathroom floor
Take whatever pill helps you find the door
For all the people you just let down
You can pay us back by never coming 'round
And until that day, that'll never be
Just don't tell anyone you came here with me
You give drugs a bad name
You give drugs a bad name
You give drugs a bad name
Baby yeah yeah yeah
Drugs got a bad enough name as it is baby



In and out and out and in
And up and down and all around
We're going through it
Nothing to it
All you've got to do is do it
Going through the motions - 1,2,3,4
I go you go you go me go
Everywhere that we go we'll be
Going through the motions - 1,2,3,4
1,2

Going through the motions
Going through the motions

I don't really care
Cause you're going nowhere
You've got nothing but fear in your eyes
You're leading me on
But you can be anyone
Cause I know you'll be gone when I rise

And we're going through the motions
Going through the motions
Going through the motions
Going through the motions

Staying with you
Gave us something to do
I always thought it was true for a while
Your loving your lies
You're so thinly disguised
You couldn't tell right from wrong if you tried

And we're going through the motions
Going through the motions
Going through the motions
Going through the motions

To thee I'll dedicate this photograph
I'll even sign it love to you, again
And when it's faded and forgotten in some book
You'll sometimes look
You'll sometimes look
You'll sometimes look

It's a game it's a game
No let's call it a shame
Cause there's no one to blame
It's a pain
You were a friend for a day
So don't cry if I say
That you got what you want, it's OK

Going through the motions
Going through the motions




To the peaceful valley
Down the winding river
To your city of souls
I've grown so tired
And my heart's too heavy
To walk any longer
To your cities of gold
All my life I've longed for forgiveness
But I can never seem to get enough
All my life I've been locked into the darkness
With a gun to my head
Trying to find a peaceful song
Trying to find a peaceful song
To sing when everything goes wrong
Till the peaceful valley calls me home

Up there in the clouds
In that glorious kingdom
Tell me there ain't nothing but an easy decline
Can I still smoke cigarettes and have my coffee
Up there in heaven and a bottle of wine
All my life, I've been lost out in the darkness
But I can never seem to get enough
All my life I've been locked into the darkness
With a gun to my head
Trying to find a peaceful song
Trying to find a peaceful song
To sing when everything goes wrong
Till the peaceful valley calls me home
Lord take me home to the peaceful valley
Down the winding river
To the city of gold



You sing a song for feeling alive
You sing a song just knowing it's right 
You write songs when everything's a mess 
You sing a song to get it off your chest 

You hate to brag but you do it anyway 
You close your eyes when you sing to yourself 
Being what you are does not make a change 
You sing a song for setting things straight 

Cuz, all in all it's wonderful 
But isn't there something missing 
All in all, wherever you go 
There is always someone listening 

You sing a song for being in love 
You sing a song that made it to the tops 
Never get wise on music, just let it go 
You sing the song if it makes you grow 

But all in all it's wonderful 
But isn't there something missing 
All in all, wherever you go 
There is always someone listening 

All in all it's wonderful 
But isn't there something missing 
All in all wherever you go 
There is always someone listening 

You sing a song for making your day
You sing a song to take the pain away

All in all it's wonderful
But isn't there something missing 
All in all wherever you go 
There is always someone listening

All in all it's wonderful
But isn't there something missing 
All in all wherever you go 
There is always someone listening

All in all it's wonderful
All in all it's wonderful



It's a mistake I sometimes make
My children lay asleep in bed
My wife lay wide-awake
I kissed her softly on the brow
I tried not to make a sound
But with stony eyes she looked at me
And gently squeezed my hand
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision
Call it intuition, something learned from mother
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms around me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord

They called at me through the fence
They were not making any sense
They claimed that I had lost the plot
Kept saying that I was not
The man I used to be 
They held their babes aloft
Threw marsh mellows at the Security 
And said that I'd grown soft
Call it intuition, call it a creeping suspicion,
But their words of derision meant they hardly knew me
For even I could see in the way they stared at me
The Spear of Destiny sticking right through me
Oh Lord Oh my lord
Oh Lord 
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh lord
Oh My Lord

Now I'm at the hairdressers
People watch me as they move past
A guy wearing plastic antlers
Presses his bum against the glass
Now I'm down on my hands and knees
And it's so fucking hot!
Someone cries, "What are you looking for?"
I scream, "The plot, the plot!"
I grab my telephone, I call my wife at home
She screams, "Leave us alone!" I say, "Hey, it's only me"
The hairdresser with his scissors, he holds up the mirror
I look back and shiver; I can't even believe what I can see

Be mindful of the prayers you send
Pray hard but pray with care
For the tears that you are crying now
Are just your answered prayers
The ladders of life that we scale merrily
Move mysteriously around
So that when you think you're climbing up, man
In fact you're climbing down
Into the hollows of glamour, where with spikes and hammer
With telescopic camera, they chose to turn the screw
Oh I hate them, Ma! Oh I hate them, Pa!
Oh I hate them all for what they went and done to you
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord



I keep on trying
To mend this but you won't
meet me half way
You say it's over
But I want you closer
What have I got to do
Just say the words

We're being crazy
We're acting so lazy
Let's put in the time
And we'll go back to
Us against the universe It'll be you and me
Us against the universe It'll be you and me

If you need
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
You are oh, oh, oh
You are oh, oh, oh
You are, you are
You're my addiction

Caught in a moment
Where I keep on hoping
Soon you'll come 'round
And see my point of view
Won't ask no questions
I'm craving your presence
There's no prescription
To get me over you
Been thinking lately
You'll say yes not maybe
Just speak the words
And we'll go back to
Us against the universe It'll be you and me

If you need
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
You are oh, oh, oh
You are oh, oh, oh
You are, you are
You're my addiction

We're fussing and fighting
I keep on trying
To mend this but you won't meet me half way



Experience grows with each and every lesson
Playing a game, an inquisition
Pay attention, find out what you're missing
I sense a wall emerge
And accept the learning curve

Through eyes of gray thoughts focused ahead
Shaped in various positions
Intent on the pages filled with words to be read
Looking for symptoms behind the conditions

The signs are poorly lit
Lines drawn upon the landscape
It's hard to tell what fits

With all that is said
The future is told
A planned destiny
That is bought and sold
To do as you please
Is just what you need
Give what is learned
And learn what to heed

The learning curve still rises before me
The more I hear the less it seems I know
How to balance above the rocks below

Boredom opens up another place in time
No passion in these plain dry woods
There's a message and it's not very hard to find
Providing you hear what is to be heard



Uninspired, so tired and wasted. 
There's lots of times I'd have telephoned, 
I couldn't find the words to say,

I'm coming home,
Lord I'm coming home
I'll make it short, 
I'll make it sweet, 
Make it up to you and me.
I'm not the same guy I used to be,
What can I do to make you believe,

I'm coming home, 
Oh I'm coming home. 
I'm coming home, 
Yeah I'm coming home.
Only seems like yesterday,
You and I were sayin' goodbye,
Now I'm just a few miles away
Gonna see you tonight.

I've been alone and I live the pain,
Reach for you in desperation. 
I was wrong, I'll take the blame,
I need you back now I just can't wait,

I'm coming home
Yeah I'm coming home.
Coming home, 
I'm just coming, coming,
Waiting it out. 
I'm just coming home.



I coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin'
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt, yeah

Well I heard it on the street
I heard you mighta found somebody new - yeah
Well who is he baby - who is he
And tell me what he means to you - oh yeah

I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
Yeah! It cuts like a knife 
Oh, but it feels so right

There's times I've been mistaken
There's times I thought I'd been misunderstood - ooh yeah
So wait a minute darlin'
Can't you see we did the best we could -ooh we could

This wouldn't be the first time 
Things have gone astray
Now you've thrown it all away

Now it cuts like a knife - yeah
But It feels so right
Oh! It cuts like a knife
Yeah! But it feels so right

Oh! It cuts like a knife!
But if feels so right baby!
Oh! It cuts like a knife!
Yeeah! Hey!

I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife - yeah
But It feels so right
Oh. Now it cuts like a knife
Yeah. But it feels so right. Yeeah!

Oh, it cuts like a knife
Ooh yeah yeah
But it feels so right baby
Ooh yeah
It cuts like a knife
Now give it to me now
Yeah yeah, come on boys, ow
Feels so right, yeah yeah yeah
Nana - hey!
Now it cuts like knife now

But it feels so right, yeah yeah
Feels so right baby
Na na yeah, it feels so right
And it cuts like a knife
Yeah yeah



Six foot high and one foot thick,
Well, do I love her,
Does a boy love pie?
Well, she is the apple of my eye.

Skinny Minnie, she ain't skinny,
She's tall, that's all.

Well, though her shadow,
Doesn't take much ground,
Well, what there is really gets around,
Well, what there ain't,
That's what she be,
And even that's way too much for me.

Well, slightly slimmer,
Than a fishing pole,
She's one half rock,
And the other half roll,
Well, dig that chick from either side,
And man, you'll yell,
Where did she hide?

Skinny Minnie, she ain't skinny,
She's tall, that's all.



Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine?
Laying on the living-room floor on those Indian tapestry cushions you made
Thinking of calling our first born Jasmine or Jade

Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it to me
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about what it might be
Don't get up to open the door, just stay with me here on the floor
It's gonna get cold in the 1970's

You wouldn't listen, you thought you knew better, you just to had to speak to that man
Please believe me, I'll visit whenever I can
Laying in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a day
You plead with the doctor who's running the show
"Please don't take Jasmine away and leave me alone"

Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it to me
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about what it might be
Don't get up to open the door, just stay with me here on the floor
It's gonna get cold in the 1970's

Do you remember me ? How we used to be helpless and happy and blind?
Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine?
Now in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a day
You plead with the doctor who's running the show
"Please don't take Jasmine away and leave me alone"



There's nothing to say, our time has run out
You took me to bed, that's what you were seeking
But you don't even care what I am about

I wanna, I wanna wake you

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I don't wanna see you, so leave me alone
Leave me alone, 'cause I feel like dying
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
The day will still come when I see you crying
'Cause you will get yours, just leave me alone

But what if I stay and wait till she comes home
She don't even know, she loves you in vain
The lies that you told will turn into sorrow
I gotta go crazy just to stay sane

I wanna, I wanna break you

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I don't wanna see you, so leave me alone
Leave me alone, 'cause I feel like dying
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
The day will still come when I see you crying
'Cause you will get yours, just leave me alone

I gotta, I gotta hate you

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I don't wanna see you, so leave me alone
Leave me alone, 'cause I feel like dying
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I couldn't care less if love just lies dying
And this is goodbye, just leave me alone



That I've been kicking in
I'll piece you back together
If you will let me in
So sorry for what I've done
But believe me I've made amends
Is there a corner in your heart
Where I can make a bed?
I still believe in you
I still believe in you

If you gave me one drop from your golden cup
I would drink it to contentment
‘Cause I don't need that much
Sometimes you must survive
On just the air you breathe
Sometimes there is no truth
But still you do believe
This is my profession
Of faith in you, my dear
I still believe in you I still believe in you
Darling you gave up



These days I've been lookin' in the mirror and wondering if that's me lookin' back or not
I'm still the apple of my mama's eye
I'm my daddy's worst fears realized
Here of late all this real estate don't seem all that real to me sometimes
I'm back out on that road again
Turn this beast into the wind
There are those that break and bend
I'm the other kind, I'm the other kind

Now my old buddy, what's his name, says, "Man what the hell are you thinkin' 'bout
Fool, you got two of everything, but you hang your head just like you was down and out"
And I'm damn sure not suffering from a lack of love
There's plenty more where that came from
Ah - but leave it up to me to say something wrong and hurt someone before I'm done

You see it used to be I was really free
I didn't need no gasoline to run
Before you could say Jack Kerouac you'd turn your back and I'd be gone
Yeah nowadays I got me two good wheels and I seek refuge in aluminum and steel
Aw, it takes me out there for just a little while
And the years fall away with every mile
"



I'm like a strange cat runnin' in the heat of the night
I've got a fire in my eyes, got a date with delight
Some kinda moaning in the heart of the storm
I'm gonna love you so hard, you'll want your loving done
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you

Uh, with my one hand loose, I aim to satisfy

Lighten up



We ain't got the tunes that's gonna to put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise, tryin' to make the radio
I'm a anti-social anarchist who sound like so-and-so

They say I'm just a stupid kid, another crazy radical
Rock and roll is dead; I probably should've stayed in school
Another generation X who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh, they'd love to see me fall but I'm already on my back

So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

Now I know I'm not a saint, I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws, I'd rather keep them in the light
They wanna criticize, scrutinize, cast another stone
Burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from the throne

They say the devil is my pal, I do a lotta drugs
The crowd will only like me if they're really fuckin' drunk
They think they know my thoughts, but they don't know the least
If they'd listened to the words, they'd find the message tucked beneath

But it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit even though they never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

You hear that?
You hear what's comin'?
Oh, you better run for the hills
'Cause we're comin' to your town
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down

Here's the moral to the story
We don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money
We don't do it for the fame

So all the critics who despise us
Go ahead and criticize us
It's your tyranny that drives us
Adds the fire to our flames

And it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
I'm only playin' music 'cause you know I fuckin' love it

It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit, they can kiss the back of my hand



Buried beneath this house, my spirit screams and dies again
Out back a monster wears a cloak of Persian leather
Behind the TV screen I've fallen to my knees

I said you got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by thread and I'm feelin' like a fool
I'm stuck here in-between the shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away
I need to get away

Blanket of silence makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
Burn all the evidence of fabricated disbelief
Pull back the curtains, took a look into your eyes
My tongue has now become a platform for your lies

I said you got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by thread and I'm feelin' like a fool
I'm stuck here in-between the shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away
I need to get away

Now, you know
Yeah, you got my back against the wall
Oh god, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sittin' duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you got my back against the wall

Deep in the jungle camouflaged by all the fallen leaves
A hand holds up the sky while shamefully I make my plea
The alters callin' but my legs won't seem to stand
Guess I'm a coward scared to face the man I am

I said you got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by thread and I'm feelin' like a fool
I'm stuck here in-between the shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away
I need to get away

Now, you know
Yeah, you got my back against the wall
Oh god, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sittin' duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you got my back against the wall

Now, you know
Yeah, you got my back against the wall
Oh god, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sittin' duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you got my back against the wall



dredging up the past to drive me round the bends,
what is it in me that I can't forget
I keep finding so much that I now regret.
But no, on I go down into the depths
turning things over that are better left
dredging up the past that has gone for good
trying to polish up what is rotting wood.

Something inside takes me down again
diving not for goblets but tin cans
dredging up the past for reasons so rife
passing bits of wrecks that once passed for life.

But I'll keep on diving till I drown the sea,
of things not worth, even mentioning
perhaps I'll come to the surface and come to my senses
but it's a very deep sea around my own devices.

Diving, diving.



Grey and white and crisp, clean
How can I live in your world
Of strawberry flowers
And colourful hours
Lovingly I dust all the dust on your shelf
Kiss the mirror clean
Where you glance at yourself
I know what to do
Maybe a letter I'll send
From underground and wait to be found out
Lovingly I press out the ink on the page
Carefully I'd scent it
In stock from the meadow
  
It is dark... in the meadow
It is dark... in the meadow
It is dark... in the meadow
  
I spill it all as I pour
Red wine will stain... remember
There's none for the little girl blue
Who lives down the stairs
And loves like the stars
But I must not forget
That I am what I am
And you must not forget
That you are who you are
  
It is dark... in the meadow
It is dark... in the meadow
It is dark... in the meadow
It is dark...



I wanted to gallop 
The streets were lit 
And we were not yet drunk 
The sledge hammer blows 
I delivered in moments 
Of truth and candour 
They made you wonder 
If this boy isn't real 
Then what do I feel 
This must be real 
But I can't stand it 
'Cause he's making me weaker 
Than I was before 
That is exactly what happens 
When you let me in through your backdoor 

Ooooooh 
Your backdoor 
Ooooooh 

I met you in springtime 
The state you were in 
Exploring and waiting 
For real life to begin 
You couldn't accept that 
I live by my own rules 
Our roads went apart 
And then your phone call 
You asked me what is it 
You wanted me to be 
I told you there was nothing 
That I wanted you to be 
I'm not talking morals 
But likes and dislikes 
That is exactly what happens 
When you let me in 
Through you backdoor 

Ooooooh 
Your backdoor 
Ooooooh 
Your backdoor 
Ooooooh 
Your backdoor 
Ooooooh



I've been trying to prove you wrong 
But now it's getting old 
I've made some blunders, I've made a few
I'm full of regrets 

There's no excuse for what I've done
There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what went wrong 
Can you forget about it and move on 

Open up and let me in, I'm begging you
I know I've done some big mistakes
But don't shove me out
I cannot turn back time and even if I could 

There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what went wrong
Can you forget about it and move on 
Can you forget about it and move on 

I know it cuts like a knife 
The pain that I've done to you 
There is no telling of what's to come 
But I wanna see it through 
If I could take it away, you know I would 

There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what went wrong
Can you forget about it and move on 
Can you forget about it and stay strong 

Stay strong

Can you forget about it
And move on



I don't know if the wind could take us
All the way downtown
Hop on to a magic carpet ride
It'll show if the wind can take us all the way
All the way around- all around
Don't look- don't even do it
You know there's nothing to it
When you've learned- I'm right

I'm never wrong
I'm never wrong
I'm never wrong- I'm always right

Come on it's a groovy kind of ride
VCR's- fancy cars and braces
Don't mean much up there
Get on to my magic carpet
Fly to the stars
Not too far it's splendid
Catch your breathe- then hold

Don't look- don't even do it
You know there's nothing to it
When you've learned- I'm right

I'm never wrong
I'm never wrong
I'm never wrong- I'm always right

No telling where at all we'll end up
No telling when we'll start to catch our breathe again
Don't look back- this is super great
I'm so glad- we won't have to wait
Don't look back- don't get me wrong

Don't look- don't even do it
You know there's nothing to it
When you've learned- I'm right

I'm never wrong
I'm never wrong
I'm never wrong- I'm always right

I'm ne-ver wrong
I can't be wrong- if I'm right



But you are always on my mind
I'll never, never feel this way again
It's hard for me to say
To tell you why I feel this way
I'll never, never feel this way again

I wouldn't try to fool you
It's you I give my love to

From the bottom of my lonely heart
Every moment that we spend apart
Baby, I promise you my love
From the bottom of my lonely heart

Just for you - No matter where you are
Baby, I promise you my love

Love hurts - So they say 
This time - Love is here to stay
I'll never, never feel this way again
It's all clear to me
That loving you is all I need
I'll never, never feel this way again

From the bottom of my lonely heart
Every moment that we spend apart
Baby, I promise you my love
From the bottom of my lonely heart



You're telling me, it's so hard
That i'm not what you thought
Thought that I would be
But little did you know, that i would turn around and leave
And now looking back, i realized that i've lost nothing
I see your face, watching me as i walk away
Leaving you behind
You can't tell me that I'm wrong for doing this
Just add me to your list, pretend you won this game
I'm walking out as I walked in or maybe better
But at least just the same



Like I'm empty inside 
I know I'm doin' good now but tonight I'm headed downtown 
Down by the riverside 

I sit underneath the freeway with an old friend from the old days 
And a bottle of wine 
Well he used to call me "Big Time", and he knew someday that I'd shine 
Said he'd seen all the signs 
He said . . 

"Keep yourself to yourself 
Keep your bedroll dry 
And boy you never can tell 
What the shadows hide 
Keep one eye on the ground 
Pick up whatever you find 
'Cause you've got no place to fall 
When your back's to the wall" 

He's gettin' old and it's showin' when I asked him how it's goin' 
He said "I've seen better I guess 
I've been rained on, I've been frozen, but this here's the life I've chosen 
If it just wasn't for the loneliness" 

Now this river suits me to a T. but if you're trying to raise a family 
It ain't no place to be 
There's a kid down by the dump there, ought to be in grade school somewhere 
Now he hangs out with me 
And I told him . . ." 

Well we finished off the bottle and I told him,"Joe I think I ought to 
Be headed uptown" 
Well it was late, and I'd been drinkin', drivin' home I got to thinkin' 
'Bout what's been going down 

Cause they're nervous down on Wall Street, but they're trying to keep it upbeat 
Or maybe they just don't care 
But down at the river eyes are burnin' cause they feel the tables turnin' 
So if you wind up down there . . .



Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, one-two-five
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man

Hey, white boy, what you doing uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasing our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just looking for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
PR shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man

Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody-body's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Aw, then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man

Baby don't you holler, darling don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time
I'm waiting for my man
Walk me home



Death and killing in control while a leader is smiling
No thoughts for the people, hearts tied to the floor
You know we never wanted this

We're taught there's nothing more
And I can't tell you it's not working
And for the prizes they promise that offer no ending to the power abusing
Our trust in this system becomes hatred

So, come out and listen?
No, we can't live through this frustration
In this world you must say no
And we're taught nothing more

In the eyes, in the heart
In the mind freedom starts
With our youth still in our hands
An earthquake in our hearts

In the eyes, in the heart
In the mind freedom starts, it's in our hearts
With our youth still in our hands
An earthquake in our hearts

In our hearts
It's in our hearts



"I had dreams when I was your age"
I don't get it, why do people change?
I swear I will never be that way


Staring at the sun, I see a brighter day
Should I, should I look away?
Staring at the sun, I feel its warm embrace
Should I, should I walk away?

In the beginning was a golden ray
God's power, but to my dismay
"We're only human," that's what people say
Still I search far away



There but for the grace of God go I
I pretend I'm not afraid to die
If there's a heaven, then I will apply
Devils heat, you better take a ride
I'm not crazy, but I believe in butterflies
Dreams that die, should be a big surprise
And life is my favourite nursery rhyme
I'm not afraid of the big bad wolf





Oh, so strong
Tell me stories of distant shores
All night long
I shiver all over
When I see your lovly tan
And I can tell by your clear blue eyes
You're a sailor man

Oh, sailor man
From polar land
Oh, sailor man
Come take my hand
Oh, sailor man
Take me along
Show me the Port-Au-Prince and Hong Kong

Oh, sailor man
I sure hope you don't drown
I'd rather have you showing me Cape Town
You know you're to New York, New York
Where we can go to bars
A strong, blonde, handsome sailor
Norwegians call you Lars

Oh, sailor man
From polar land
Oh, sailor man
Come take my hand
Oh, sailor man
I'd gladly die
To see the ports of Rostock and Shanghai

Sailor Man
Oh, sailor man
Please take my hand
Oh tender sailor man



Fantastically high
Look at all the colors
We've managed to invite
Breathe in before the magic begins
We've arrived

Settle back, enjoy the flight
Fantastically high
Look at all the colors
We've managed to invite
Breathe in before the magic begins
We've arrived



I feel it slipping away
I gave it all
but no one cared
I feel it slipping away 

I feel it slipping away
my god it's slipping away
I gave it all
but no one cared
I feel it slipping away

I feel it slipping 
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping 
I feel it slipping away

I feel it slipping away 
I feel it slipping away
no more pain
no more fear
I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping 
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping 
I feel it slipping away

I just can't learn to forget
now I'm choking on the memories
choking on regret
I tried but I can't find a way
to untangle all the pieces
after they've been thrown away
I feel it slipping 
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away

I will not suffer this loss
of you again and again and again
I refuse to continue to live
in this perpetual nightmare
I decide it ends right here
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping 
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away

I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
everything is slipping away



Last call now I'm out of time
And I don't got no valentine
Singled out, now I stand alone
The underdog at a modern world
Suburbia's hot tonight
But nothing seems to feel alright

I don't want your sympathy
I just need a little therapy
At least that's what they say to me

Hey, ho, let's go!
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it

One, two, fuck you!
Don't tell me what to do!
I don't wanna be like you

Can't you see, it's killing me?
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down, I'll keep on moving
It's the art of losing

Whoa, whoa

Set the mould and do what you're told
Get a job and start growing old
9-5 can make your dreams come true
But I don't wanna be like you
I'm not cool and I'll never be
I break the rules and I guarantee

I don't want your sympathy
I just need a little therapy
At least that's what they say to me

Hey, ho, let's go
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it

One, two, fuck you
Don't tell me what to do
I don't wanna be like you

Can't you see it's killing me
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down, I'll keep on moving
It's the art of losing

You call me a loser
You say I'm just a user
But I'll just keep on moving
'Cause that's the art of losing

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Two, three, four!

Hey, ho, let's go!
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it

One, two, fuck you!
Don't tell me what to do!
I don't wanna be like you

Can't you see, it's killing me?
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down, I'll keep on moving
It's the art of losing

Whoa
It's the art of losing

Whoa
It's the art of losing

We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids in America
We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids in America



Down crowded streets he walks alone 
He's a stranger out of place 
A number not a face 
And all day long, all day long

He's feelin' like an alien 
Feelin' like he don't belong 
Have mercy, cried the alien 
Help him find his way back home 

The feelin' that he feels he can't explain 
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, they're all the same 
He's lost and all alone 
A heart without a home 
Standin' like a statue in the rain 

He's feelin' like an alien 
Feelin' like he don't belong 
Have mercy, cried the alien 
Help him find his way back home 

Now, now and then we all are aliens 
Feelin' like we don't belong 
Have mercy, cried the alien 
Help him find his way back home 

Feelin' like an alien 
He's feelin' like he don't belong 
Have mercy, cried the alien 
Help him find his way 
Help him find his way



The place that we met
Protected and warm
In the perfect storm

I think you pretend
That you are my friend
It's easy to see
That you're envious of me

Hold, hold, hold, hold
Hold, hold

You should open your eyes
Make it easy to accept things
You should open your eyes
Make it easy to accept things
Accept things

You should not forget
The people you met
On the way up
Or on the way down

Hold, hold, hold, hold
Hold, hold

You should open your eyes
Make it easy to accept things
You should open your eyes
Make it easy to accept things
Accept things

Hold, hold, hold, hold
Hold

You should open your eyes
Make it easy to accept things
You should open your eyes
Make it easy to accept things
You should open your eyes
Make it easy to accept things
You should open your eyes
Make it easy to accept things







Forget what I just said
I'll crawl over broken glass
If we could start again
Before our plans were made
When the world was young
The house was falling down
Because of my loose tongue

I shouldn't say so much
I shouldn't talk so loud
It's sooner on your lips
And it's all over town
In all our given days
How many gone to waste
A good man has been hung
Because of my loose tongue

Your skin is changing it's hue
Your god is coming down fast
Looks like someone I knew
Uncovered happiness at last

And all the wagging tongues
Too much information
In the future now
Under massive doubt
The papers on the street
Get trampled under feet
And they settle for a princely sum

Good will is coming down
And when it rains
Your well is full

You shouldn't ask me, shouldn't ask me
You want the real story, shouldn't ask me
You better find someone else with the house key 
You know impression on his personal life
You know the man's walking on the edge of a knife
Your tail is getting long and your nose keeps growing
Perhaps some time you forget what you know and
Now I feel I'm getting caught with a psycho sycophant
And ... a kicked out tin can
Got the poor man nailed to the floor
And that's not enough when you wanna beat more

He's only halfway through his life
He's only used up all his time



Said 'let's give it a try'
I swallowed my fears
A couple of years
Just living a lie
I'd just come from the country
Wide-eyed and naive
I signed on the line
I signed a long time
Now you won't let me leave... but you

Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
When you've nothing to lose... no you
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Put yourself in my shoes

I don't want any trouble
I ain't after a fight
But well-respected man
Please understand, man
You're standing in my light
No use sticking together
I've gotta get out and get off
I offered you a slice
You told me no dice
Cos you wanted the lot... but you

Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
When you've nothing to lose... no you
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Put yourself in my shoes



Burning up in my head
But I won't listen
I won't do this again

You're gonna bury yourself tonight
You're staying up straight till the morning light
And nothing's forever
But you're getting better

This city's gonna half fall
Not enough to keep the walls from coming down
You have to believe in yourself
You're better off without an escape
Leave it all
And as a concept in your mind
Accept that this is the way it goes

Would you wish for
Would you wish for again?
A simple reason, a simple reason instead?
You're gonna bury yourself tonight
You're staying up straight till the morning light
And nothing's forever
But you're getting better

This city's gonna half fall
Not enough to keep the walls from coming down
You have to believe in yourself
You're better off without an escape
Leave it all
And as a concept in your mind
Accept that this is the way it goes

The way it goes
The way it goes
And believe it's alright

This city's gonna half fall
Not enough to keep the walls from coming down
You have to believe in yourself

This city's gonna half fall
Not enough to keep the walls from coming down
Accept that this is the way it goes
You're better off without an escape
Leave it all
And as a concept in your mind
You have to believe in yourself



And see the women weeping there
Then go up into the mountains
The men, they are weeping too

“Father, why are all the women weeping”
They are all weeping for their men
“Then why are all the men there weeping”
They are weeping back at them

This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the men and women sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long

“Father, why are all the children weeping”
O they are merely crying, Son
“O are they merely crying, Father”
Yes, true weeping is yet to come

This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the little children sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long

“O Father, tell me are you weeping
Your face, it seems wet to touch
O then I'm so sorry, Father
I never thought I hurt you so much”

This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While we rock ourselves to sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long
No, I won't be weeping long
No, I won't be weeping long
No, I won't be weeping long



sea's bed
sea's bed
sea's bed
sea's bed
sea's bed
sea's bed
what else can i place here?
what more can be returned?
it seems as though you have tried
no one will ever feel your bleeding
and now the tide's come to leave here
to go find myself again
i enter her very softly
until it's away from this land
all the pain inside
that we try to hide
if you can't find me
look beneath the sea's bed
sea's bed
sea's bed
sea's bed
oh-ho-ho
maybe it comes up there
underneath the surface
so go listen carefully to the proclaiming wind who carries with it
and that is what i remember
the sweet smile of remedy
one final breath and i'll dive down
the worlds become's obsolete
and this is what i remember
the pain of being alive
just like a bewildered child
who's only trying to hide
all the tears we've cried
in an endless fight
if you can't find me
look beneath the sea
all the pain inside
that we try to hide
if you can't find me
look beneath the sea's bed
lady oh-ho-oh
everything that you thought will be fine
everything that you begin to feel inside
everything that you thought you'd know
everything that you've come to see will show
everything that you thought will be fine
everything that you begin to feel inside
everything that you thought you'd be go
everytime that you thought to go with the flow
everything you got to be and know
everything you start to feel and show
everything you start to see inside
everything you got you know to you hide
everything you do to be alone
everything you know you feels so
everything you know just feels fine
everything you know and want to do
no one seems to understand!
how my heart's been pulled in half!
so now here's one final breath!
as i sink into her blue chasm
whoa
everything you got to be and know
everything you start to feel and show
everything you start to see inside
everything you got you know to you hide
everything you do to be alone
everything you know you feels so
everything you know just feels fine
everything you know and want to do
and this is what i remember!
the pain of being alive!
just like a bewildered child!
who's only trying to hide!
all the pain inside
that we try to hide
if you can't find me
look beneath the sea bed



One more man gone
One more man is gone 

The good son walks into the field
He is a tiller, he has a tiller's hands
But down in his heart now
He lays down his queer plans
Against his brother and against his family
Yet he worships his brother
And he worships his mother
But it's his father, he says, is an unfair man
The good son
The good son
The good son 

The good son has sat and often wept
Beneath a malign star by which he's kept
And the night-time in which he's wrapped
Speaks of good and speaks of evil
And he calls to his mother
And he calls to his father
But they are deaf in the shadows
Of his brother's truancy
The good son
The good son
The good son
The good son 

And he curses his mother
And he curses his father
And he curses his virtue like an unclean thing
The good son
The good son
The good son 

One more man gone
One more man gone
One more man
One more man gone
One more man gone
One more man
One more man gone
One more man gone
One more man







Few have been kind, fewer truthful
And though within my ability, sir
I remain dutifully youthful

I go gray, then bald, with chagrin
When you play the violin
How I pray for death to begin
When you play the violin

True, there's been trouble and trickery, sir
Trembling and tribulations
Twitches from switches of hickory, sir
You, sir, and your usurpation

But my patience wears very thin
When you play the violin
How I stay, I can't imagine
When you play the violin

I've endured struggling and thuggery, sir
Physical ed. and psychosis
Sculleries, skulls, and skullduggeries, sir
Haplessness, hype and hypnosis

But, oy vey! The horrible din
When you play the violin
You betray an ear made of tin
When you play, when you slay the violin



As I stepped through the door 
And all my friends were gathering
That day that I recall 
I shivered and shook, Lord I stood
Just waiting to chase the fall 
I wondered how my time would be
When spring comes round, once more 

I face the wind, I have no choice
But you must guard the hearth 
And cast adrift from those I love
Alone I drag my heart 
Against the cry of why
I turn my back to go 
But out beyond the tears somewhere
Someone, I need to know 

It's only love, in the colours of the shade
It's only love, in the colours of the shade 
All in shades, ah, it's only love

Old photographs were fading dim 
My seed will tell it all
Oh by the Fathers Fathers have Such pain, 
They read the signs without surprise 
Of how they knew it well
And in the mirror still I see 
The man, who came from hell

It's only love, and the colours of the shade 
It's only love, in the colours of the shade
It's only love, in the colours of the shade They say, they say, they say
It's only love, it's only love



He's gonna sweep everything in his path
And when the heavens cry it's gonna drown the sky
And you'll get caught in the aftermath
When the mountains move it's no good trying
To prove that you've been doing everything you can
And don't you start to cry when you're about to die
You gotta stand up and take it like a man
Because you've been taking instead of giving
And all the while you've been living lies
Economics, all your atomics
Ain't gonna save you from that bird in the sky
And when the good times roll wrapped up in your mink coat

You will be stepping from your Cadillac
You will be stepping from your Cadillac
And in a micro flash you're gonna feel the lash
Of big eagle's wing across your back
And when the seas subside you'll see him glide right out of view
In clouds of snow the rains will come
And wash away the scum so that all the little flowers can grow
There'll be no more taking, only giving
And the sun pouring down
No economics and no atomics
Just the spread of Mother Nature's gown
Do you hear me, Mother Nature? ...



I'm a mountain that has been moved
I'm a river that is all dried up
I'm an ocean nothing floats on
I'm a sky that nothing wants to fly in

I'm a sun that doesn't burn hot
I'm a moon that never shows its face
I'm a mouth that doesn't smile
I'm a word that no one ever wants to say



I'm a mountain that has been moved
I'm a fugitive that has no legs to run
I'm a preacher with no pulpit
Spewing a sermon that goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

Well if we take all these things and then bury them fast
And we pray that they turn to seeds, to roots and then grass
It'd be all right, it's all right 
It'd be easier that way

Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
Like you knew it was time to start things over again
It'd be all right, it's all right
It'd be easier that way

But don't lose all that seed
Well if we take all these things and then bury them fast
She won't go underground
And we pray that they turn to seeds, to roots and then grass
You don't want to mess with this honey
It'd be all right, it's all right
Feel the flow
It'd be easier that way

Don't say you won't get scared and leave
Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
And don't you mention all the good there would be
Like you knew it was time to start things over again
Don't say "is he gone?"
It'd be all right, it's all right
Feel the flow
It'd be easier that way



What I'm not doin' right 
The fire's burnin' bright 
And you look so, oh so good tonight

I've been tryin' to make yon happy
For such a long time
Workin' hard to keep you
So much it's a crime
Give me what I want
'Cause I'm losin' my mind for your

Wild love
All I want is your wild love 
Give me a taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you

Somewhere in your eyes
There's a lovelight that you just can't disguise 
Darlin', darlin', darlin', every night
I still wonder what I'm not doing right

I've been tryin' to make yon happy
For such a long time
Workin' hard to keep you
So much it's a crime
Give me what I want
'Cause I'm losin' my mind for your
Wild love
All I want is your wild love 
Give me a taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you
Wild love
All I want is your wild love 
Give me a taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you

Oh yeah, oh baby, oh

Wild love
All I want is your wild love 
Give me a taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you

Makin' love to you
Makin' love to you
Oh yeah, ooh

Wild love
All I want is your wild love 
Give me a taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you

Wild love, wild love
Give me a taste or your wild love
While I'm makin' love to you
Oh yeah, give me, give me more or your

Wild love
All I want is your wild love 
Give me a taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you



I'll carry on regardless 
Got enough money for one more beer 
I'll carry on regardless 

Good as gold, but stupid as mud 
He'll carry on regardless 
They'll bleed his heart 'til there's no more blood 
But carry on regardless 

Carry on with laugh 
Carry on with cry 
Carry on with brown under moonlit sky 

I want my love, my joy, my laugh, my smile, my needs 
Not in the star signs 
Or the palm that she reads 
I want my sun-drenched, wind-swept Ingrid Bergman kiss 
Not in the next life 
I want it in this 
I want it in this 

Got one note to last all week 
I'll carry on regardless 
The hill to happiness is far too steep 
I'll carry on regardless 

Dried his mouth in the Memphis sun 
He carried on regardless 
Tried to smile and he bit his tongue 
But carry on regardless 

Carry on with work 
Carry on with love 
Carry on with cheering 
Anything above 

I want my love, my joy, my laugh, my smile, my needs 
Not in the star signs 
Or the palm that she reads 
I want my sun-drenched, wind-swept Ingrid Bergman kiss 
Not in the next life 
I'll have it in this 
I'll have it in this

I don't want silver, I just want gold 
Carry on regardless 
Bronze is for the sick and the old 
But carry on regardless 

I want my love, my joy, my laugh, my smile, my needs 
Not in the star signs 
Or the palm that she reads 
I want my sun-drenched, wind-swept Ingrid Bergman kiss 
Not in the next life 
I'll have it in this 
I'll have it in this



On the fifth horse in the sixth race
I think its name was Chips Ahoy

Came in six lengths ahead
We spent the whole next week getting high
At first I thought that she hit
On some tip that she got from some other boy
We were overjoyed



I got a girl and she don't have to work
She can tell which horse is gonna finish in first
Some nights the painkillers make the pain even worse

Came in six lengths ahead
We spent the whole next week getting high
I love this girl but I can't tell if she's having a good time


How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you?

How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance?

How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you?

How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance?

She's hard on the heart and she's soft to the touch
She gets migraine headaches when she does it too much
She always does it too much


How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you?

How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance?

How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you?

How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance?

And you won't even dance



You surround me you steal my breath

Trapped inside here when you're around
I should go home move away from me

This time I mean it it's time you left me alone
I won't hurt myself for you or anyone

You're too near me 'cause I'm on fire
I should go home move away from me

This time I mean it it's time you left me alone
I won't hurt myself for you or anyone x3



Anyhow what is my life to you
Well there's no point it's true in pursuing you
And it's not that I can or I'd want to
But to be honest I'll say that there have been times
When I've desired a kiss or a smile
Once or twice you've shown the face I like
And it's affected me more than I'd want it to

But what's the use in telling you
If you don't feel the way I do
It's so very wrong to hold a love so strong
And never have the chance to share it

Bye bye now my sweet love
Bye bye now my sweet love
Bye bye those tears I cry
I need you only to say goodbye

And now and again when I don't feel so shy 
I pretend to remember your name 
When the eyes don't see the heart doesn't feel 
And the distance between us remains

But what's the use in telling you
If you don't feel the way I do
It's so very wrong to hold a love so strong
And never get the chance to share it



She knocks, he lets her in
The flame that flickered long before
When they were only kids
Just one thing, The thought in side her head
She turns to him and looks at her and says

Every moment in your life
Comes down to what you hold inside
Looking back on days gone by
Id always think of you
Take a picture from the past
And try to make the moment last
I wish I would have told you
I just wanna hold you tonight tonightx2

The living room they start to talk
The memories flooding in
Of drinking in the parking lot
And dances in the gym
Just one thing, The thought in side her head
She turns to him and looks at her and says

Every moment in your life
Comes down to what you hold inside
Looking back on days gone by
Id always think of you
Take a picture from the past
And try to make the moment last
I wish I would have told you
I just wanna hold you tonight tonightx2

Many nights he lied awake thinking the moments passed him by
But they hold on to the memories
Its so hard

Every moment in our lives
Comes down to what we hold inside
Looking back on days gone by
Id always think of you

Every moment in your life
Comes down to what you hold inside
Looking back on days gone by
Id always think of you
Take a picture from the past
And try to make the moment last
I wish I would have told you
I just wanna hold you tonight

I just wanna hold you tonight x4



Such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumpin'
And the hub caps all gleam

When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
And my hand on your grease gun
Oh it's like a disease son

I'm in love with my car
Gotta feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks sayin' this is the end now
Cars don't talk back
They're just four wheeled friends now

When I'm holdin your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive

I'm in love with my car
Gotta feel for my automobile
I'm in love with my car
String back gloves in my automolove



With a heart that nobody can see
Time is wasting there
There's no escaping it
How long will your sweet pleasure be
 
Fancy lady, you are just a stranger
To all the lovers you don't get to know
You try hiding all the broken traces
For the one love you had to let go
 
I got love, sample my wares
I got love, try if you dare
I got love, sample my wares
You got plenty love inside
 
Fancy lady, where are all the children
Who were born to you, so sweet and true
Will you give them all your sad parading
Have them doing the same things you do
 
The great creator, he's a liberator
He always gives a helping hand
Fancy lady, time's no waiter
Find yourself while
You still have a chance
 
Fancy lady is masquerading
With a heart that nobody can see
Time is wasting there
There's no escaping it
How long will your sweet pleasure be
 
Fancy lady, you're a stranger
To all the lovers you don't get to know
You try hiding all the broken traces
For the one love you had to let go
 
I got love, sample my wares
I got love, try if you dare
I got love, sample my wares
'Cause you got plenty
Of good love for sale
 
Fancy lady, where are all the children
Who were born to you, so sweet and true
Will you give them all your sad parading
Have them doing the same things you do
 
The great creator, he's a liberator
He's always giving a helping hand
Fancy lady, time is no waiter
It will run out on you
Before you can say
 
I got love, sample my wares
I got love, try if you dare
I got love, sample my wares
I got plenty of love to share
 
Ooh, baby love to share
Gimme some love, baby love to share
I want it, baby love to share
Won't you give it to me, baby love



In Philadelphia PA, 
Deep in the heart of Texas, 
On down the Frisco bay. 
All over Saint Louis 
And down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
Sweet little sixteen. 

Sweet little sixteen, 
She's just got to have 
About half a million 
Framed autopraphs. 
Her wall is filled with pictures, 
She gets them one by one. 
Becomes so excited, 
Oh watch her at the run boy. 

Oh mommy mommy, 
Please may I go. 
You know it's such a sight to see 
Somebody steal the show. 
Oh daddy daddy, 
I beg of you. 
Please say it to mommy 
It's alright with you. 

Sweet little sixteen 
She's got the grown up blues. 
Tight dresses and lipstick, 
She's sporting in high heeled boots. 
Oh but tomorrow morning 
She'll have to change her trend 
Become sweet sixteen 
And back in class again. 

They're really rocking in Boston, 
In Philadelphia PA, 
Deep in the heart of Texas, 
On down the Frisco bay. 
All over Saint Louis 
And down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
Sweet little sixteen.



Ringin' off the wall,
It's your Las Vegas lawyer - Another long distance call,
He says you get the house and the car,
And I get the clothes I got on.

Yeah - Now she's gone,
Long, long, long, long gone,
Now I'm a happy boy,
She's long, long, long, long gone.

Operator get me Manhattan - Get my baby on the line,
Sooner or later she's gotta realize,
That all my feelin's were for real,
But maybe she was leadin' me on.

Yeah - Now she's gone,
Long, long, long, long gone,
Now I'm a happy boy,
She's long, long, long, long gone.

She took the Frigidaire,
She got my favourite chair,
You could say she got the best of me,
It's like a legal crime,
But in a matter of time,
She'll be back for the rest of me.

Oh yeah.

Yeah - Now she's gone,
Long, long, long, long gone,
Now I'm a happy guy - Yeah
She's long, long, long, long gone,
Give me a little peace of mind - Yeah.



And it took me back to a time when we
We were more than friends
I realized I was staring at the floor
And all my friends keep telling me
I do it more and more

I try so hard push you from my mind
And get a grip on life and then it's
Slowly slipping away
But in my room I sit by the window in a chair
And remember you sitting there
With your picture in my hand

It brings me back when I hear your name
Remembering childhood games and playing in the rain
I sometimes wonder if you feel the same
Because I think of us when I hear your name

I lose myself in memories
Of pleasant times because in all my dreams
You're always by my side
Things aren't what they used to be
And I wonder if it's destiny for me
To wake up alone



Then it turned out that we were one hit short 

Ah, we went jamming 'till the break of dawn, oh 
Ah, when we were done the producer called to listen 

You've made the one, the number one 
The best I've ever heard 
You made the one, the golden one 
She called it the best song in the world 

And so we did and baby here we are 
Sure feels great to hear you sing along 
Thinking back I recognize your face 
From the very night we wrote this song 

Ah, dancing in a rehearsal room, oh 
Ah, your body told me that you loved the tune 
You said; "Listen!" 

You've made the one, the number one 
The best I've ever heard 
You made the one, the golden one 
She called it the best song in the world 

Here we go 

spoken 
Are you ready to be Wig Wammed? 

You've made the one, the number one 
The best I've ever heard 
You made the one, the golden one 
She called it the best song in the world 

You've made the one, the number one 
The best I've ever heard 
You made the one, the golden one 
She called it the best song in the world



I've got something to say that might save your soul
this sign is a warning so pay attention
open up the earth you could lose control

this place is full of shit that kills
maybe us and maybe you, it's true

you can dig for diamonds in the dust
and you can dig forever if you must
but if you dig this mountain high and clear
there's much to fear
just don't dig here

we considered ourselves a powerful culture
the bully pulpit waved the flag on high
we feasted on the carrion like vultures
across the land the bones were piling high
against the sky

then we filled the mountain to the brim
sealed it in, just don't pull the pin

you can dig for diamonds in the dust
and you can dig forever if you must
but if you dig this mountain high and clear
there's much to fear
just don't dig here

you can dig for diamonds in the dust
and you can dig forever if you must
but if you dig this mountain high and clear
in the atmosphere
just don't dig here



So messed up I want you here 
And in my room I want you here 
And now we're gonna be face to face 
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place 
Yeah you know what that is 

Now I wanna be your dog 
Now I wanna be your dog 
Now I wanna be your dog 
C'mon I wanna be your dog you know it 

Ooh give it to me 
Now I'm ready to close my eyes 
Yes now I'm ready to close my mind 
Now I'm ready to feel your hands 
Lose my heart on the burning sand 

Now I wanna be your dog 
Now I wanna be your dog 
Now I wanna be your dog 
C'mon I wanna be your dog you know it 

Do it 
Yeah that's right 

So messed up I want you here 
And in my room I want you here 
And now we're gonna be face to face 
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place 
Yeah you know what that is 

Now I wanna be your dog 
Now I wanna be your dog 
Now I wanna be your dog 
C'mon I wanna be your dog you know it 

Well come on 
I'll be your dog



One thousand five tiny steps from here
But if I brought you near
would you believe when I say
It seems like yesterday
that I could reach out and touch your face
But as I fall from grace
into whose arms can I lay

It's always much too late
We get the signs
We can't communicate
Or turn back time

So what will be now, do you feel somehow
not so together and not quite as strong
Now I believe
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely
After you've gone

I need a healing wind
to cool the flame burning in my sight
It must accelarate
For two wrongs they don't make a right

And all these solitaires, lone victories
Wars faught in isolation, with none to please

So what will be now, do you feel somehow
not so together and not quite as strong
Now I believe
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely
After you've gone

The future's still uncertain, the past is done 

So what will be now, do you feel somehow
not so together and not quite as strong
Now I believe
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely
After you've gone

Now I believe
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely
After you've gone

Now I believe
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely
After you've gone



But I feel it in every breath
So many have promised to heal me
Till my money and hope was spent
And I am hiding in this crowd
He may be just beyond my grasp

But if I just reach out, if I just reach out
Just for a moment, could everything change
I reach out, if I just reach out
For the hem of His garment, could everything change

Worry is the water rising
And it's flooding up to my neck
I've nothing to lose but can I believe
These broken years are in my past
Then eyes like fire and warm like the breeze
Turn and meet mine

Oh, if I just reach out, if I just reach out
Just for a moment, could everything change
I reach out, if I just reach out
For the hem of His garment, could everything change

I feel like something has changed
I feel like something has changed
I feel like something has changed
I feel like something has changed

I feel like something has changed
I feel like something has changed
I know I, I felt something change, I

I just reached out, I just reached out
Just for a moment and everything changed
I reached out, I just reached out
For the hem of His garment and everything changed

I reached out, I just reached out
Just for a moment and everything changed
I reached out, I just reached out
For the hem of His garment and everything changed

Oh, everything changed



How quickly these conversations seem to end
You meet a friend, every now and then
How quickly these relations turn into trends

Put all your walls up and open your windows
And close all your doors
You catch yourself standing in front of the mirror
And now you need more

So what do you wish for, to catch you as you're falling
So easy to ignore but now you hear me calling again

I wouldn't wanna be you this lonely game that you play
Between your walls you confuse every heart that you break
So afraid that you'll lose always avoid to replace
I wouldn't wanna play you

You try and pretend, the truth is hard to bend
How easy these translations can be read
What if you were led to play a different game instead
How hard these frustrations are, they are to mend

Put all your walls up and open your windows
And close all your doors
You catch yourself standing in front of the mirror
And now you need more

So what do you wish for, to catch you as you're falling
So easy to ignore but now you hear me calling again

I wouldn't wanna be you this lonely game that you play
Between your walls you confuse every heart that you break
So afraid that you'll lose always avoid to replace
I wouldn't wanna play you

Does it matter to you?
Does it matter to you?
Does it matter to you?
Does it matter to you?

What do you wish for, to catch you as you're falling
So easy to ignore but now you hear me calling again

I wouldn't wanna be you this lonely game that you play
Between your walls you confuse every heart that you break
So afraid that you'll lose always avoid to replace
I wouldn't wanna play you

Just wait
Just wait
Just wait



When your heart gave way?
No air inside, no eyes to see your way
Life on earth is gone
Today you're holding on to the hand of God
Finally you're truly alive now
You've made it home
Did you fall upon your knees?
Tell me could you speak of anything


When he took your hand
When he wiped your tears away?
Tell me, did he speak?
One day we will see you, we will hear you voice of life
One day, we will all come home
And we will finally be alive
Finally you've made it home



One smoke and your head spins around and around
Chrome mags, a million drags, it never lags
An old transport queen mama, you never seen

Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a-burnin' fuel
Push it over, baby
We're makin' love unto you

Power booster, I'm talkin' to God and more
Crank it up and above my head
Smell my shit eating grin on the skin of my world
Six hundred sixty six miles per hour

Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a-burnin' fuel
Push it over, baby
We're makin' love

Hear a purrin' motor 
And she's a burnin' fuel, oh they were burnin'
Push it over, baby 
We're makin' love unto you
Makin' love unto you, making

Get back, get back a-rollin'
Get back, get back a-rollin'
Get back, get back a-rollin'

Get back, get back motherfucker 
Get back, get back a-rollin' 
Get back, get back motherfucker
Get back, get back motherfucker

Motherfucker
Motherfucker



The child of one stupid steamy night
Born to roam beneath the sun
What do you think of me, I'm better left alone
I met a Holyman that said that he knew the way
And he'd like to show me so my life won't go astray
Take my hand child now little boy don't you be afraid
I'll take your soul and walk on water
Holyman, ya don't understand
The cuts on me they run much deeper
Holyman, you righteous man
I've been shown the way a thousand times
Not one a keeper
Older man he said I'll tell you boy
You've planted rotten seeds
And in a land of happiness
They'll grow us evil trees
Guided minds, and eyes that will never see
Holyman I'll tell you
Just what it is that I believe
Holyman I tell you man you gotta
Believe in what you see
Cause its you that corrupt us man and
Deep throat philosophy
I don't need your spells or the little
Games you try to pull on me
Come to think of it I don't need your religion
Gotta get away
I wish you would understand
Everybody prays
Let me find my own way



Sucker swallow every time
Airplane come erase your mind
Seems there's been an accident
Telephone costs you fifty cents

To find out the retail
Gory detail
Nothing here for me
I get all of my kicks for free

Mangy dog without a collar
Buy me love for forty dollars
I got love for sale
Come on, get some before it gets stale again

I win the double for a lie
I get my money on the fly
We're throwing down
So come on by, I'll be around

I've got three, six, nine
Another dollar makes a dime
Yeah, all in double Dutch again
Notify your next of kin, I say

Mangy dog without a collar
Buy me love for forty dollars
I got love for sale
Come on, get some before it gets stale now

Love don't mean a thing
But two a.m. and a telephone ring
Love is all you need
And all you need is love
Love is all you need
And all you need is love

We go underground
'Cause there's emptiness above

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm just being
I'm just being
I'm just being
I'm just being

Honest, honest, honest
Honest, honest, honest

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



That hasn't been said before
And I have been polite for too long
Why should I be anymore

Better now than never
Better loud than clever
Better just to play the fool

It's times like this
When you just close your eyes and kiss
'Cause everything after this
Is just bullshit and being cruel

So hold me up, I'm going out
And don't wait up, I won't be coming home
If you lay me down in concrete fields
Will I dream of grass and opera
This is the sound and how it feels
To be dead

And in the end there will be fire and brimstone
And no one will be there to answer the telephone
You are the only one I'll miss
You are the only answer at a time like this

She is he trick of my trade
She is the thing that can't be made
She is gold and nothing less
And she is fearless

And hold me up, if we're going out
And don't wait up, we won't be coming home
If you lay me down in concrete fields
Will I dream of grass and opera
This is the sound and how it feels to be dead

Oh, oh

You hold it in your hand, you
You keep it in your heart, you
You hide it in your head, and you
You use it when you have to

She is the trick of my trade
These are the things that can't be made
Stay yourself and nothing less
Stay fearless
Fearless
Fear--
Fearless



When it feels like, when it feels like
Culture gets too much for me, I go , I go outside
Singing songs to alabys, singing songs to alabys,
Singing songs to alabys,
A song is a beautiful lie, a song is a beautiful lie
A song is a beautiful lie, a song is a beautiful lie

When it feels like, when it feels like
Culture gets too much for me, I go , I go outside
Singing songs to alabys, singing songs to alabys,
Singing songs to alabys, 
A song is a beautiful lie, a song is a beautiful lie
A song is a beautiful lie, a song is a beautiful lie

When it feels like, when it feels like
Culture gets too much for me, I go , I go outside
Singing songs to alabys, singing songs to alabys,
Singing songs to alabys, 
A song is a beautiful lie, a song is a beautiful lie
A song is a beautiful...
LIE

A song is a beautiful lie, a song is a beautiful lie
And they know that one day when you die
That maybe you will buy, maybe you will buy
But now I sit alone and say a song is a beautiful lie



Smell the roses but steal the vines
Don't wait for the hands of time
To second guess and change your mind

And shine
Here's your moment to shine
Shine

Lay down, my friend, close your eyes, breathe in
And I'll take you there and back again
No more questions why, I'm not so surprised
Why you have been there and back again

Replace, replace that line
That spoke to you and showed no signs to be alive
So are you livin' or dead?
You've made a choice to hear your voice
Or hold on to what they said

Now, shine
Here's your moment to shine
Shine

Lay down, my friend, close your eyes, breathe in
And I'll take you there and back again
No more questions why, I'm not so surprised
Why you have been there and back again

Back again, back again
Back again, back again

Lay down, my friend, close your eyes, breathe in
And I'll take you there and back again
No more questions why, I'm not so surprised
Why you have been there and back again

Lay down, my friend, close your eyes, breathe in
And I will take you there and back again
No more questions why, I'm not so surprised
Why you have been there and back again



Drive me crazy 'Cause my feet won't quit as I go slidin' in the sweet zone
Round round like you want me to do
Down down like you're beggin' me to
The floor's small and the wall's too steep

Oh, baby, got those personal moves so deep inside my move groove

Found found found
Found found found
Someone who's worth it
In this murkiness
Someone who's never
Seeming to be scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
Oh, but if I'd never found
Oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
The more you give your love
And I do believe that
The more you give your trust
The more you give your trust
And the more you give your love
The more you're bound to lose
The more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
Oh, but if I'd never found
Somebody who wants to be
Who wants to be with me ...
...All the time



I've got my weary bones
I've got my lessons learnt
I've got my a hand to hold

But I could have had her right inside my pocket
She could have been just mine you have at home
But the love we shared went faster than a rocket
And the diamond she gave me turned back into gold

GO!

I've got my cheques to cash
I've got my 
I've got my battle lost
I've got my a ribbon wo en

But I could have had her right inside my pocket
She could have been just mine you have at home
But the love we shared went faster than a rocket
And the diamond she gave me turned back into gold
And the diamond she gave me turned back into gold
And the diamond she gave me turned back into gold



At the bar when he sees her coming over
What you gonna do, if she walks up to you
Tongue tied better get yourself together
Pound another drink, to give him time to think
What's your sign hey I think you know a friend of mine
All the stupid lines, that he had ever heard
Wouldn't come to mind he couldn't say a word

Tonight Tonight, he's gonna get it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
In a perfect world, all the geeks get the girls

Got her holding steady, forgot her name already
Sweatin' hard not a smooth operator
She's got it going on, dancing to her favorite song
He's got the line is it your place or mine
She turns and walks away, where did he go wrong?
But waiting by the car, she says what took you so long

Tonight Tonight, he's gonna get it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
In a perfect world, all the geeks get the girls

The very next day, he guessed she ran away
The one and only in his bed so lonely
But she comes walking in, with coffee and a grin
Crazy as it seems, it wasn't just a dream
And all around the world, people shouted out
The geeks got the girl

Last night he finally got it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
Shout it all around the world cause the geeks get the girls

Last night he finally got it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
Shout it all around the world cause the geeks get the girls

Shout it all around the world cause the geeks get the girls



You put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.

I could look out the window or stare at the wall,
But really it didn't matter, no, I just didn't care at all.
Could be sitting by the water, counting every stone,
'Cause nothing means nothing when you're empty and on your own.

But you put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.
Makes me so much stronger,
I'm amazed at the change in me.

Well, I knew what I was doing, I was running away,
Busy going nowhere, just wasting the time of day.
Walking down the road, kicking up the stones,
Nothing means nothing when you're empty and on your own.

But you put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.
Makes me so much stronger,
I'm amazed at the change in me.

I can hear the sweetest voice
sounding out across the distance
breaking through the noise

then there comes a vision
and then a touch so tender
no more indecision
I surrender

I try and keep my heart protected
I try and keep my cool
but just as I suspected
I don't make the rules

I'm giving myself over
no more great pretender
I wanna be your lover
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender

I'm giving myself over
no more great pretender
I wanna be your lover
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender



I come to you, I look to you and say
When will I become everything that you've intended me to be

I'm beating at my chest everyday
I run to you, I come to you and say
When will I become everything that you've intended me to be

I am so tired, I am so beaten
From walking down this road of shattered dreams
I am so lonely, I am so broken
Won't you come, won't you rescue me

I am so tired, I am so tired, I am so tired, I am so tired

I'll be the light inside of you and won't let go of you
Come rescue me, won't you come, won't you come
I'm calling out your name



In a small brown bag marked "need me, have me"
What are you gonna do when the world turns in on you?
Hey, check it out, think of me once in a while
Hey, May, we've placed your friends out near the garden
Near that small brown bag marked "need them, want them"
What are you gonna do when the world turns in on you?
Hey, check it out, think of me once in a while
Did it make you happy?
DId it come in handy?
"But of course," she'd say
"It's gonna hurt me more this way"
Hey, May, we'll tie a string out round the garden
Little small torn bag marked "need them, want them"
What are you gonna do when the world turns in on you?
Hey, check it out, think of me once in a while
Did it make  you happy?
Did it come in handy?
"But of course," she'd say
"It's gonna hurt me more this way"



Starts a burnin' fire inside of me
She knows how to take the heat
How to take the heat away from me

When I need it
When I need it
When I need it
She's there to cool me down

When I need it
When I need it
When I need it
She's there to cool me down

She knows when I've had too much
Still the devil's hand is tempting me
She knows how to speak to me and tell me
You know some things are not worth the trouble

When I need it
When I need it
She's there to cool me down

When I need it
When I need it
When I need it
She's there to cool me down

And it feels like
She knows when I'm feelin' like
My world is at a desperate end
She knows how to comfort me
She is there for me
She points me toward another day

When I need it
When I need it
She's there to cool me down

When I need it
When I need it
When I need it
She's there to cool me down

She cool me down
She cool me down
She cool me down



The woman she like Calypso
The steel drums drive her crazy
And she can't seem to say no
She just can't seem to resist them, no

She's been drinking Jamaican rum
Dancing to the steel drums from the Caribbean
Drinking Jamaican rum
It's that West Indian rhythm

It was wild, it was wild
The night she came home drunk
She kicked in the door
And said lover you know what I want
Lover, give me what I want

She's been drinking Jamaican rum
And she's living with a black man
He's from the Caribbean
Drinking Jamaican rum
She's been drinking Jamaican rum
Dancing to the steel drums from the Caribbean
Drinking Jamaican rum
Rum and cola
It's very popular and it's twice as nice with ice



We're almost undone now
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

Awaiting the call of what would you say
And can you come over
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

It was you
Who could get me high
With whatever you say
You tell me something real

What we've done
It doesn't matter now
Whatever it takes
For you to stay with me

Trading thoughts across from the room
I saw you surrounded
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

Feeling us fall without an escape
I almost let you down
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

It was you
Who could get me high
With whatever you say
You tell me something real

What we've done
It doesn't matter now
Whatever it takes
For you to stay with me

It was you
Who could get me high
With whatever you say
You tell me something real

What we've done
It doesn't matter now
When I was caught in the rain, you make me feel
You make me feel, make me feel

I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

I was caught in the rain
Caught in the rain



The pale-faced lady she said to me
I've watched you with my one green eye.
And I'll hurt you 'till you need me.
You scuff your heels and you spit on your shoes.
You do nothing with reason
One day you catch a train
Never leaves the station.

Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for me
Now you can make believe on your tin whistle
Ah, you can be my broom boy
Scrub me 'till I shine in the dark
I'll be your light 'till doomsday
Oh, it's a black cat cross your path.
And why don't you follow
My claw's in you and my light's in you
This is your first day of sorrow

Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for me



In the room where we did it all
Careless reminders of another girl staying here 
Are hard to ignore 

She don't feel jealous no, she just feels strange
Time is doing well by us 

Beautiful when love fades slowly
And we talk with the ease of old
Later on, cooling down slow
Nothing between us solved 

Our love is fading, but how could you tell?
It's killing the pain, sparing the love
It's doing well by us 

Time
Time
Time is doing well by us 

It's been some months since she came around
Lying where she used to lie
She's so beautiful I could eat her
Been some months, making me love too slow
Making me love so, so long

did the world slow down?
don't believe I've ever seen you around
When did you get here?
How long have you been here?

I'm bending over backwards, 
for a better view
and there is nothing 
that I wouldn't let you do
If you were near
If only you were near

Are you from out of town or outer space?
So glad to see you landed in this place
You're so gorgeous
It's killing me
And we know 
that you know 
that I know

won't you give me something
I'd give anything
And we know 
that you know 
that I know

I'm hanging on to every word you haven't said
And I'm already holding you inside my head
oh can't you see?
Just what you do to me?

A gift for breaking 
every heart in here
But you already know that, 
don't you dear?

You're so gorgeous
It's killing me
And we know 
that you know 
that I know

won't you give me something
I'd give anything
And we know 
that you know 
that I know

The hand that you are holding, 
should be mine
The lips you are kissing, 
should be mine, mine

You're so gorgeous
It's killing me
And we know 
that you know 
that I know
won't you give me something
I'd give anything
And we know 
that you know 
that I know



The girls were kinda flirting with the setting sun
We all kinda fumbled through the Jitterbug
We were all powered up on some new upper drug

Everyone was funny and everyone was pretty
And everyone was coming towards the center of the city
The dance floor was crowded, the bathrooms were worse
We kissed in your car and we drank from your purse

I had my mouth on her nose
When the chaperone said that we were dancing too close

We had some massive nights
Every song was right
All that wine was tight
And your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool

And there weren't any fights
There's usually one or two 
Some guys they get a little bit uptight
Some girls they got something to prove 

We had some massive highs
We had some crushing lows
We had some lusty little crushes
We had those all ages hardcore matinee shows

I was down on my knees
When the chaperone said that it was time for me to leave

We had some massive nights
And every song was right
All that wine was tight
Your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool

And there weren't any fights
There's usually one or two 
Some guys they get a little bit uptight
Some girls they got something to prove 

We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights

We had some massive nights
And every song was right
All that wine was tight
Your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool

She had the gun in her mouth
And she was shooting up at her dreams
When the chaperone said that we'd been crowned
The king and the queen



I oughta be sleepin' - 'steada stayin' up late,
When I oughta be doing all the things I should do,
I think about you.

I oughta be writin' - But I can't find the song,
Just sittin' here driftin' - driftin' along,
There's only one thing that I wanna do,
And that's think about you.

I think about you - I can't get no rest,
I think about you - There ain't no one else,
It's all I can do - I can't help myself,
Yeah - I think about you.

I could go cruisin' - But I've had enough,
I could go drinkin' - But I can't stand the stuff,
It just don't do me like it used to do,
I'd rather think about you.

I think about you - I can't get no rest,
I think about you - There ain't no one else,
It's all I can do - I can't help myself,
Yeah - I think about you.

Well I think about you - I can't get no rest,
I think about you - There ain't no one else,
It's all I can do - I can't help myself,
Yeah - I think about you.

Yeah! I think about you - I can't get no rest,
I think about you - There ain't no one else,
Yeah - It's all I can do - I can't help myself,
Yeah - I think about you.



A long long time, 
I made it mine 
You've accompanied me and 
You proved your point 
You're all alone like that 
Your kingdom's wide 
All is right 
It is your mind 
Can't you see that you're the one  
Who's left behind 
You can't catch up with us 
Youth 
You must 
Confuse me with 
Someone else 
Mistrust 
It's all around you 

If you take a look outside 
You'll find it out 
The world is blind 
Everybody's acting 
Like a citizen, 
A childish thing to do 
When you lose 
Don't take the blame 
There's got to be a reason 
Not you my friend 
It's all around us 
Youth 
You must 
Confuse me with 
Someone else 
Mistrust 
It's all around you 

Can't you just talk in 
My face and say it loud 
What it's about 
It's no use to hold it back 
There's always 
Someone listening to you 
And your complaints 
Faint smile 
Big now reason 
Not you my friend 
It's all around us 
Youth 
You must 
Confuse me with 
Someone else 
Mistrust 
It's all around you



Still you wonder what happened
You'd give the world for one more try
But you're too shy to ask him
You don't wanna ask him now

How could I ask for anything more
The beauty in my madness
Spinning in circles 'til I'm on the floor

How much weight can I bear
Smile as though I'm satisfied with this disguise
I gave in it
So roll me away

Start again
'Cause this isn't what I had planned to be
This addiction contradicts the picture in my head
But in the end it's everything I have

Say goodbye to passion
Why would I ask for anything more
This beautiful distraction
Kill my reaction and help me to know

How much weight would I bear
I cannot be satisfied with this disguise
I'm losing grip
So roll me away

Start again
'Cause this isn't what I had planned to be
This addiction contradicts the picture in my head
But in the end it's everything I have

How did I want this
Yes it was
Contemplate to be it
This addiction contradicts the picture in my head

But in the end it's everything I have
Everything I have



I know I used to run around
Now I'm swear I've settled down
May-maybe what they say is true
All those things I've done to you

People say that I don't change
The song still remains the same
Oh, but I got what your needing so
Oh, come on hold me tight and don't let go

Oh no, don't start saying goodbye to me
Don't start saying, oh no don't start saying goodbye to me

I only heard a thing or two .... 
I only hurt when I'm around
Oh that's just I'm feeling down
At night I ... I do I ... up to you .....
Oh come on, hold me tight and don't let go

Oh no, don't start saying goodbye breaking my heart
Oh no don't start saying, goodbye breaking my heart

Oh, ho-ho-hold me 

When I tell you that I know that I know
When I tell you that I care
When I tell you that I love you
When I tell you 'bout it anywhere

When I tell you 'bout what it could be like oh
when I tell you that, when I tell you that
When I tell you that, when I tell you that
When I tell you that, when I tell you that
When I tell you 'bout what could be like
Oh, when I tell you that, you know you really wanna know

At night ... What you got is what you need Ah ..
But I got what your needing so
Come on, hold me tight and don't let go

Oh no, don't start saying goodbye breaking my heart
Oh no, don't start saying goodbye breaking my heart
Oh no, don't start saying good-bye don't start saying
Oh no, don't start saying



Your weakness I taste. 
I breathe you, I hate you. 
You course through my veins. 

And now. 
And now. 

You want me. You love me. 
And I hate myself. 
I need you, but I hate you. 
'Cause I want nothing else. 

And I bleed you since I've healed you. 
Your pain escapes through me. 
'Cause I breathe you, but I hate you. 
'Cause they say we could never be. 
They can't see. 

I know I shouldn't love you. 
There's just too much to fake. 
But you see me, and I feel you. 
And I am not afraid. 
I'm not afraid. 

And I bleed you since I've healed you. 

Your pain escapes through me. 
'Cause I breathe you, but I hate you. 
'Cause they say we could never be. 

It seems the pain's been traded, 
Since I pulled you through. 
And now my mind's been so jaded. 
And I would kill myself for you. 
I'd die for you. 

And I bleed you since I've healed you. 
Your pain escapes through me. 
'Cause I breathe you, but I hate you. 
'Cause they say we could never. 

And I bleed you since I've healed you. 
But I hate you, but I breathe you. 

And I see you. 
And I feel you. 
And I hate you. 
But I'd die for you. 
I'd die for you.



All along you played it rough.
You did me wrong. Oh, I've had enough. 
Yeah, yeah.

'Cuz every clue I didn't see 
From all the things that you've done to me.
Yeah, yeah.

Why has it taken so long
To see what's been happening to me?
This time around, hey, I'm gone.
Hey, I'm gone.

Oh, your lying eyes were telling me
The way you feel is all a disguise.
Yeah yeah

I can't believe I've been a fool 
For loving you way too damn long. 

Why has it taken so long
To see what's been happening to me?
This time around, hey, I'm gone.
Hey, I'm gone.

You better get ready for a stormy day,
'cuz everything you love's about to wash away.
I'm not gonna stand around and let you be
So cruel to me. No.

Na na... na na... na na... na na... na na na 
Oh, so cruel to me.

Oh, why has it taken so long
To see what's been happening to me?
This time around, hey, I'm gone.
Hey, I'm gone.

You better get ready for a stormy day
'cuz everything you love's about to wash away.
I'm not gonna stand around and let you be
So cruel to me. No.

I'm not gonna stand around and let you be 
So cruel to me. No.

Na na... na na... na na... na na... na na na 

Not gonna stand around and let you be
So cruel to me. No.



Will never make it out of here
Alive

Please just let us go insane
We're traveling with spiders legs
With our heads above the waves
The water broke our fall

You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive

You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive

I can't carry on for long
I start to feel the pain again
Now the days all look the same
I'm losing sight and hold of home

You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive

Cause there will come
A day when you'll silence
The crowds

And you and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive

It feels as black as the thoughts I had
When the road was as dark as my fears
just take comfort in knowing that
All of this ends when I am done

Please just let us go insane
There's nothing to declare but us

You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive

Cause there will come
A day when you silence
The crowds

Because you and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive



Dying stars of the silver screen
Oh she danced that famous gypsy dance
With a hole in her tambourine

I was young enough and dumb enough
I swallowed down my Mickey Finn
She'd hijacked a few hearts, all right
I went into a tail spin

Oh, don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't stir it up again

I put my arm around her waist
Says she "Young man, you're getting warm"
The room was going somewhere without me
And she laughed as she read my palm

Oh, don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't stir it up again

Oh stillborn love, passionate dreams, pitiful greed
And the silver tongues of the tinker girls
Who throw the book of life at you
But they don't know how to read

She was a third generation Transylvanian
I was the seventh son of a seventh son
I begged the band "Don't play that tune.
Please don't beguine the begun"

When I awoke, she'd cut and run
She stole my blueprints and my change
Just a horseshoe and a note on the bed
And all it read was "Strange"

Don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't stir it up again



On this journey we are sometimes broken.
We try to embrace the truth.
Healing comes from within our hearts.

They say the heart is where the healing begins,
All our wrongs are made right again.
There is healing for us all.
There is healing body and soul.

She cries.
He left her there with her heart broken, he denies what they say.
She falls and prays that God would give her peace and He wipes her tears away.
There is healing.
You'll find healing from within.

I'm trading in this troubled heart.
Healing from within your heart.
I'm trading in this troubled heart.



She's the mistress of my heart now
She's a '65 with an overdrive
I fixed her in every part now
2 in the front and 2 in the back
110 on the old Hog's Back
She's my MGB-GT she's a runner now

I welded the sills and the old floor pan
Cut the rust with the torch and the hacksaw
Took the Rostyles off, put the spoke wheels on
Got a brand new Salisbury axle
WHen I drive through town the girls all smile
They say, there's a man with retro-style
MGB-GT she's a runner now

Lockheed discs and twin SUs
Original chrome on the grill now
Looks llike a dream in racing green
Competition's standing still now
I sprayed her body, I strengthened her frame
I stripped her right down and built her up again
MGB-GT

An Alpine's fine if you've got the time
And a Healey'll set you back some
TR4 cost a little bit more
But it don't have the same attraction
Hard top handy case of the weather
I don't care if it rains forever
MGB-GT



It's the same old circle
You see, it's got to be
It says right here on page 43
That you should grab a hold of it
Else you'll find
It's passed you by

Rainbows all around
Can you find the silver and gold?
It'll make you old
The river can be hot or cold
And you should dive right into it
Else you'll find
It's passed you by

Pass it 'round one more time
I think I'll have a swallow of wine
Life is fine
Even with the ups and downs
And you should have a sip of it
Else you'll find
It's passed you by



I said alright, you make me love you, it's alright, you make me love you

When the winter wind is a-blowin', well you never know where it's goin'
For the land is cold and the night is closing in
You can feel your heart is getting older,
you can feel the world is getting colder
And it feels so good with you standing next to me

Oh baby alright, I think I love you,
It's alright, you make me love you
Oh I said alright, I think I love you,'
It's alright, you make me love you

Now the days are all getting shorter, they seem to slip away like water
For the land is cold and the night is closing in
But you're always there when I need you,'
when it feels the world is against you
Oh it feels so close with you standing next to me

Oh baby alright, I think I love you,'
it's alright, I think I need you
Oh babe it's alright I think I want you, I think I need you
Oh babe it's alright, oh babe it's alright, now that you're here

Oh it's an icy wind that's a-blowin' and you never know where it's goin'
But it feels so good when you're curled up close to me

Oh baby alright I think I love you, it's alright you make me love you
I said it's alright, I think I need you, it's alright you make me love you...'



Don't need no transportation
When you take me for a ride
You know I get exited when you put your spell on me
You can lock me up forever and throw away the key

Cuz you're Mine All Mine
Lighting up my fire
I don't care about anything as long as you're around
Cuz you're Mine All Mine
The one that I desire
You don't like to waste no time
When we're getting down

Feels like getting higher
I can't tell a lie
Like a drug up in my vein you know you make me wanna fly
I don't believe in preachers
And politicians too
All I ever care about is when I am with you

Cuz you're Mine All Mine
Lighting up my fire
I don't care about anything as long as you're around
Cuz you're Mine All Mine
The one that I desire
You don't like to waste no time
When we're getting down

You know you set me free
So what do you want to see while you're watching me
Baby don't you know
I can't let you go
Again and again
I'm in your command


Cuz you're Mine All Mine
Lighting up my fire


I don't care about anything
As long as you're around


Cuz you're Mine All Mine the one that I desire
You don't like to waste no time


When we're getting down
Down
Down
Down



I've written down the concept
It's casual to deny
Along sentimental lines
A little bronze age eclectic
And born for the first time
Returning to the tried and tested methods
Keep it modern and alive

I took it as a warning sign
When the heavens clouded over
I've got to keep it in sight
It's the reason for me being in the morning light
To have a clear, clear vision
Despite all the things I'm told

Broken down and homesick
To hide the disappointment
Because a fortunate life, holds no surprise
WHen you're looking for distinction
And what it brings
Then it's an easy climb to find
A worthwhile reason when you're looking for

A warning sign
An inhibited persona
Into the lines of empty sky
They're richer than my feelings for the morning light
To have a clear clear vision
Despite all the things I'm told



It's alright
Oh, you're so tired of playing the rules
It's alright

Well, I see you coming around here
About midnight
Telling me that
Everything's alright

Well, I'm born
And you're born
And I die
And you die

And I live
And you live
To get high, oh, my

It's alright
It's alright

He's a man in an awful way
He'll help you everyday
I see the man in an awful way
I'll take you back where you wanna stay, hey

It's alright
It's alright

Well, you don't want to go to school
It's alright
Oh, you're so tired of playing the rules
It's alright

Well I've been stuck
Here on my floor
I cannot move no more

Well, I'm born
And you're born
And I die
And you die

And I live
And you live
To get high

It's alright
It's alright

He's a man in an awful way
He'll help you everyday
I see the man in an awful way
I'll take you back where you want to stay

It's alright
It's alright



Sing a song that I can't capture
I'll make it up to you somehow

High my hat was hung there for a while
On a pole set up Norwegian style
Ready to show them what I can
Little bird came flying by
And as northern flames light up the sky
That bird was singing out of range
And I got lost into a haze
He couldn't pick me up so I took him down
To be the centre of my crown
And I thought he'd make the change
He was singing out of range

Wild bird flying
Sing a song I can't capture
I'll make it up to you
Wild bird flying
Sing a song I can't capture
I'll make it up to you
If you can understand and now
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow

You know it will never be the same
Truly wild will never tame
And I think it is a shame

Cuz all of the sudden he stopped singing his song
I lost my mind and all went wrong
I've got a heavy hand

Wild bird flying
Sing a song I can't capture
I'll make it up to you
Wild bird flying
Sing a song I can't capture
I'll make it up to you
If you can understand and now
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
Wild bird flying
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
Wild bird flying
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
Wild bird flying
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow
Wild bird flying
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow



There's nothing that can't be done
But how long should it take somebody
Before they can be someone?

'Cause I know there's got to be another level
Somewhere closer to the other side
And I'm feeling like it's now or never
Well, can I break the spell
Of the typical?
The typical
Oh, mmm

Now, I've lived through my share of misfortune
And I've worked in the blazing sun
But how long should it take somebody
Before they can be someone?

'Cause I know there's got to be another level
Somewhere closer to the other side
And I'm feeling like it's now or never
Well, can I break the spell
Of the typical?
The typical
The typical, uh huh
I'm the typical
I'm the typical
Can I break the spell of the typical?

So ah
Because it's dragging me down
Oh, I'd like to know about when
When does it all turn around?

Hey!
I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical

Yeah, I know there's got to be another level
Somewhere closer to the other side
And I'm feeling like it's now or never
Well, can I break the spell
Of the typical?
The typical
The typical, uh huh

Of the typical Break the spell
Of the typical Break the spell
Of the typical
Can I break the spell
Of the typical?
Of the typical, say!
I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical, 'cal
I'm just the typical



What were we thinking?
I got a brain cloud from the black light in your room
Built up B.C. just crazy
But it just made us jumpy
When we should have been smooth

How do they save you from yourself?
How do they save you from yourself?
How will she save me from myself?

I know just what you mean
Who will spearhead the invasion?
I know just how you feel
Who will spearhead


Dropped off the face of the Earth
Bobby is my hero for that
Down a hole with the Grinch's antler dog
And Yukon Cornelius
When I'm sober I need this

I know just what you mean
Who will spearhead the invasion?
I know just how you feel
Who will spearhead



I know just what you mean to me
Who will spearhead the invasion
I know just how you feel
And I feel, and I feel



I can’t see through,
And I’m standing right beside you,
I’m hoping that you don’t move,

Blocking our views so they don’t get older,
But you keep on moving over,
You become part of the view,
And part of the world that I see through,

And you have been gone too long,
Gone too long,
Gone too long,

And you have been gone too long,
Gone too long,
Gone too long,

You need everything in moderation,
Even moderation,
Under a sunless western sky,
You put toothpaste under your eyes,
To make yourself cry at your graduation,
And the further and further away we move,
From ourselves my name still depends on you,

And you have been gone too long,
Gone too long,
Gone too long,

And you have been gone too long,
Gone too long,
Gone too long,

Oh, ohh ohhh,
Ohh ohhhh,
Ohh ohhhh,

And you have been gone too long,
Gone too long,
Gone too long,

And you have been gone too long,
Gone too long,
Gone too long,



Can't buy the book
No one's listening
But I guess you could
Try whistling this

You say you're tired
Liquid as water
But you'll succumb now
As I stroke your back
I'm the best that you know

And every time you think of me
I hope you're thinking true romance
And every time you want to leave
You'll give us both another chance

Warmest welcome
Violent stranger
He said come here
As he pushed me down
Impossible to do
In high heels
Walking into walls
Ever wondered
If you're here at all?
Try whistling this

And my words are ringing in your ears
Drawing your attention now to all the things that you ignore
If I can't be with you, I would rather have a different face
If I can't be near you, I would rather be adrift in space
And if the gods desert us now, I'll turn this chapel into flames
And if someone tries to hurt you, I will put myself in your place



She could say what I say just as well as me
And you'll see
When she walks about her silver sun
I could never spot another one but her

Of all the people that I know... all the people that I know
All the people they don't know where they're goin' to
Exactly what they're gonna do
But she'll spare some time for you

After everything I've thought about
I can see now that she has no doubt at all
About me
After everything she's said and done
I can see she knows I've just begun to leave

All the people that I know... all the people that I know
All the people that I know... all the people that I know

Angel is a girl that knows me well
She could say what I say just as well as me
I know you'll see
After everything she's said and done
There could never be another one for me... cause she's

All the people that I know... all the people that I know
All the people that I know



Was amazed when she stole my thunder, filled my world with the ways of wonder

Come away come away with me, Far away where the eyes can't see
Come away to another time, Pardon me if you lose your mind

Who are you now? Who makes the rules?
Follow your heart and get back....
Won't you get back....'
Oh get back

Was alone then along came Mary, hair of gold and lips like cherries
Was amazed when she stole my thunder, Filled my world with the ways of wonder

Come away come away with me, Far away where the eyes can't see
Come away to another time, Pardon me if you lose your mind
Pardon me if you lose your mind
Pardon me if you lose, oh if you lose your mind



Lives a naughty little girl
Who clicks her tongue
I love the way she talk
She pay no attention
Knows I’m one of them sad boys
Who's hypnotised by girls who walk the walk

I'm no good and I like it
And the end is coming soon
Above the lion
Is hungry for the dark side of the 

Decatur
The complicator
I want a little more
The saviour
Of misbehaviour
It's all right
Circle tight
Say goodnight
Hit the town, yeah
Hit the town

Up high the sky
Is dark and wide tonight
It looks like it’s going to fall
Are you all alone
Or shall I squire you home?
Or would you rather see me crawl?

I know what I had
And I know what I got
Maybe my soul
Is like a vacant lot, shot

Baby
It's complicated
Though I’ll never know
A favour to run away
You want to party?
You want to party?
You want to?

Do you? Do you?
Do you want to roll with me?
Do you? Do you?
Do you want to roll with me?

'Cause I’m juvenile, impractical
And I’ll make you cry, hysterical

You want to ride?
Ain't nothing free
See something you like
You got to pay me

You got to pay me
Sugar, got to pay me
You got to pay me or play me
Girl, you got to pay me now
Pay me now
Pay me now
Pay me later
You’re going to pay me, girl
Pay me now
Pay me now
You’ll pay me later
You’ll pay me later
You’re going to pay me, girl
You’re going to
You’re going to
You’re going to pay me, girl



You might as well go home 
She says my beard gets into your hair 
So give me back my comb 
But you 
You make things that get along 
Turn out so wrong 
Doo ron, doo ron 
You'd better rock on 
The band might play our song 

See my baby jive 
See my baby jive 
She hangs onto me and she really goes 
Whoa whoa whoa
See my baby jive 
Such a lazy jive 
Well every one you meet coming down the street 
Just to see my baby jive 

That tenor horn is turning me on 
He's dropped down to his knees 
Oh boy that sax is calling me back 
This dog ain't got no fleas 
But you 
You dance all the guys up town 
Into the ground 
Doo ron, doo ron 
You gotta rock on 
Your Daddy ain't coming home 

See my baby jive 
See my baby jive 
She hangs on to me and she really goes
Whoa whoa whoa
See my baby jive 
Such a lazy jive 
Well every one you meet coming down the street 
Just to see my baby jive

Too bad,So long,it's driving me mad
The top down on my car
I don't suppose that everyone knows
exactly who you are
but you
You make things that get along
turn out so wrong
Doo ron, doo ron 
You gotta rock on
The band might play our song

See my baby jive 
See my baby jive 
She hangs onto me and she really goes 
Whoa whoa whoa
See my baby jive 
Such a lazy jive 
Every one you meet coming down the street 
Just to see my baby jive
Whoa See my baby jive
She hangs onto me and she really goes 
Whoa whoa whoa
See my baby jive 
Such a lazy jive 
Every one you meet coming down the street
Just to see my baby jive
See my baby jive



Sounded like a disco,
Must've turned the dial for a couple of miles,
But I couldn't find no rock 'n roll.

This computerized crap ain't gettin' me off,
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock.

London to L.A.,
Talkin' 'bout the new wave,
For a couple of bucks you get a weird haircut,
And waste your life away.

Around the world or around the block,
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock.

Get me my D.J.,
I got somethin' he's gotta play,
Wanna hear it I can't wait,
So turn it up, turn it up...

Kick down the barricades,
Listen what the kids say,
From time to time people change their minds,
But the music is here to stay.

I've seen it all from the bottom to the top,
Everywhere I go kids wanna rock.

Around the world or around the block,
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock.

Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock.



You better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
It's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false-colored eyes
She builds you up just to pput you down
Down

'Cause everybody knows She's a femme fatale
The things she does to please She's a femme fatale
She's just a little tease She's a femme fatale
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool
It's true

'Cause everybody knows She's a femme fatale
The things she does to please She's a femme fatale
She's just a little tease She's a femme fatale
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

'Cause everybody knows She's a femme fatale
The things she does to please She's a femme fatale
She's just a little tease She's a femme fatale
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

'Cause everybody knows She's a femme fatale
The things she does to please She's a femme fatale
She's just a little tease She's a femme fatale
Everybody knows



Between the fire and the flame
We're all lookin' for somethin'
To ease the pain

Now who can you turn to
When it's all black and white
And the winners are losers
You see it every night, hey

I need somebody, somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody
I need somebody, hey what about you
Everybody needs somebody

When you're out on the front line
And you're watchin' them fall
It doesn't take long to realize
It ain't worth fightin' for

I thought I saw the Madonna
When you walked in the room
Well your eyes were like diamonds
And they cut right through, oh they cut right through

I need somebody, somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody, oh yeah
I need somebody, hey what about you
Everybody needs somebody, hey

Yeah, another night another lesson learned
It's the distance that keeps us sane
When the silence leads to sorrow
We do it all again, all again, hey

I need somebody, somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody, oh yeah
I need somebody, oh what about you
Everybody needs somebody

I need somebody, somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody, needs somebody
I need somebody, yeah what about you, baby
Everybody needs somebody

I need somebody
Everybody needs somebody
I need somebody
Everybody needs somebody



It's a 100 degrees, I'm on my knees
If the one you blow is the one you show
Well then you know I'm right

This bitter place was built for you
Sit by the fire, tell me true
Don't blind my eyes, turn them blue
And then I'll dry my face on you

Step on, I beg you please
It's a 100 degrees, so I freeze
Drowning in that ice that fly
It's a great white place
And the heat's diseased

This bitter place was built for you
Sit by the fire, tell me true
Don't blind my eyes, turn them blue
And then I'll dry my face on you

One hundred degrees
One hundred degrees
One hundred
Hundred



you can read about it all in imaginary stories but you never get the glory 'cos in life it ain't the same
you give a bit, and you give a bit, and it's all you'll ever d-d-d-do
but you still keep believing in your loveshit
'cos you're hoping one day it'll happen to you, like 
my baby with the sunset eyes, making moves that can burn my soul
well it's the last song we'll ever hear before we go 


what can I do about this loveshit anyway?
there's nothing you can do to ease my mind
what can I do about this loveshit anyway?
d'you have to waste your life before you find
it's all loveshit 

sign your name on the dotted line, it's time for you to su-su-su-suffer
you're gonna wish you'd changed your mind in a-three weeks time
'cos then you'll find that one lover's like another
say goodbye to it, maybe cry a bit, it's a waste of fucking t-t-t-tears
but you still keep believing in your loveshit
'cos if you ain't holding hands people say that you're queer 

teacher, teacher won't you open your eyes, teach me something that I need to know
'cos it's the last song we'll ever hear before we go 


oo oo oo-oo 

It's a popular myth that we've grown up with since the age of man's desire
if it's true romance to be in your pants I don't buy, I don't buy, you know I don't buy 

{lots of chatter including:}
mmm...
... mentioned it, now what was your name?
… everybody does...
I bet the chorus comes now... 




Something we don't understand
More than a triangle
Billy, me, Bobby and Ann
We don't understand

Billy he loves me
But, I just don't love him
Cause I only love Bobby
But Bobby loves Ann
Ann she loves Billy
But his eyes are on me
But I only see Bobby
But Bobby loves Ann

We've got ourselves a love tangle
Something we don't understand
More than a triangle
Billy, me, Bobby and Ann
Looks like a love tangle
Something we don't understand
More than a triangle
Billy, me, Bobby and Ann
We don't understand

Like a love story
With the final page missing
It's a four-way heartbreaker
Cause Bobby loves Ann

We've got ourselves a love tangle
Something we don't understand
More than a triangle
Billy, me, Bobby and Ann
Looks like a love tangle
Something we don't understand
More than a triangle
Billy, me, Bobby and Ann
We don't understand



To get through the things clear
I wonder you're my brother?
Thoughts easy disappear
This weight this heavy stone
The voices on the phone
I know that you'll make it
You have nothing to fear

You can tell your soul
I will not let go
And you can bring it all back home
And shine your light through the hearts of stone

So please let me try
Get me through to your love
And please let me sigh
You know I tried
But I never found my feelings for you
So please let me try

Do you wanna live
I'll promise you to give
Every little twinkle
Until I lose everything
If you just let me try
You'll wonder why you cried
This poem like an airplane
Will fly and touch the sky

And you can tell your soul
I will not let go
If than you can bring it all back home
And shine your light through the hearts of stone

So please let me try
Get me through to your love
And please let me sigh
You know I tried
But I never found my feelings for you
So please let me try

Just please let me try
Just please let me try
Please let me try
Let me try
Try oh

So please let me try
Get me through to your love
And please let me sigh
You know I tried
But I never found my feelings for you
So please let me try



The word was God
And put on flesh to dwell with us

In Him was the life
And the life was the light of men
And it shines in the darkness

And even as the rain and snow come down
Do not return empty
Making it bear fruit and sprout
So Your word will be

For the word is living and active
Like a sword piercing the division
Of soul, marrow and spirit

And even as the rain and snow come down
And do not return empty
Making it bear fruit and sprout
So Your word will be
So Your word will be

A light unto my path
Strength to carry on
The treasure I have found within
Is hidden in my heart

Even as the rain and snow come down
And do not return empty
Making it bear fruit and sprout
So Your word will be
So Your word will be
So Your word



With the lorries rolling by,
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky,
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies,
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes.

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning,
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around.

Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand,
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand,
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain,
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane,
If you're walking home alone.

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning,
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around.

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning,
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around.



Curtain falls,
The lights all fade to gray.
Don't think there'll be an encore
For our secret Passion Play.

It's time to play the final card
In a game I now despise.
To me it seems so obvious-
To you it's such a big surprise.

It's already over-
If I stayed here, I'd only make you cry.
It's already over-
We can't move forward,
So let's move on...
Bye-bye.

They say parting is such sweet sorrow,
But I'm still looking for the sweet.
I feel just like a baby-
These tears don't miss a beat.

And I'd rather be anyone but Here
And anyplace else but Me.
I'll just climb inside my head awhile-
My demons have a date with me.

It's already over-
if I stayed here, I'd only make you cry.
It's already over-
We can't move forward,
So let's move on...
Bye-bye.

So go ahead, and hate me now
For breaking-up on the phone.
But I know that I'd crack if i saw your face-
I deserve to be alone.

And I hate that i still love you, girl-
And I only wish you well.
But i'll never be man enough for you,
And you're a psycho bitch from Hell.

It's already over-
If I stayed here, I'd only make you cry.
It's already over-
We can't move forward,
So let's move on...
Bye-bye.

So long.
Farewell.
Bye-bye.



A back door lust for her
I know it's wrong
But I'm doing it again
My pulse is racing
My mind is chasing thoughts of the after taste of what makes me fiend for more

I've gone too far
And I'll do it again
Just for a taste of anything that's laced with innocence
I've gone too far

The morning after the damage is done for now
But I know it will come back and take me again

I'm tangled in
I'm tangled in her moves as my conscience takes the back seat to my hands that can't refrain

I've gone too far
And I'll do it again
Just for the taste of anything that's laced with innocence
I've gone too far

I must confess that there's nowhere left for me to go
So I'll dive right in again
Its dark enough in here so don't turn on the lights
Because I don't want to appear
I'll dive right in again



Can you hear your blood pound?
I will think of you in pieces
I will picture us found
In my filthy mouth
Well it makes my mom proud
I will bask in our disaster
If it'll phase us out

Hey, hey, Carmelina
Target practise is for Mexico
And I've become spectacular
Which is strange, 'cause I feel dumb

Can you feel me glide in?
Can you make the pig sounds?
I will think of you above me always
I will picture us clowns
My filthy mouth
Well it hides my clean selves
I will bask in my disaster 
Maybe it'll phase me out

Hey, hey, Carmelina
Target practise is for Mexico
And I've become spectacular
Which is strange, 'cause I feel dumb

Hey, hey, Carmelina
Target practise is for Mexico
I've become spectacular
Which is strange, 'cause I feel dumb
Strange, 'cause I feel dumb
Which is strange



Hey, hey
Alright

I've been feeling sick and tired
So put it down
Nowhere there's nothing in sight
So put it down

I just wanna get it right away
So put it down
Same feeling yesterday
Hey, hey, alright

I'm feeling through my bones
Yeah, yeah
I'm feeling all alone
Yeah, yeah

Come on, let's get it on
Yeah, yeah
I want to feel like I did all yesterday
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So put it down

It's something I want to do
So put it down
I want to do it with you and you
So put it down

Come on, get the feeling once again
So put it down
Come on, get it on my friends
Hey, hey, alright

I'm feeling through my bones
Yeah, yeah
I'm feeling all alone
Yeah, yeah
Come on, let's get it on
Yeah, yeah

I get the feeling that it's looking alright again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So put it down
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright

A-one, two, a-one, two, three, four
I'm feeling through my bones
Yeah, yeah
I'm feeling all alone
Yeah, yeah
Come on, let's get it on
Yeah, yeah
I get the feeling that it's looking alright

I'm feeling through my bones
Yeah, yeah
I'm feeling all alone
Yeah, yeah
Come on, let's get it on
Yeah, yeah
I get the feeling that it's looking alright again

Yeah, yeah, yeah
So put it down
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey



And unfamiliar laughter floats across the crowded street
For me the street signs all point down my hopes are all with you
Foreign princess, it's your castle won't you lead me through
I'm a stranger with no one to give direction to my sighs
Allow me please to nestle in the summer of your eyes
Cause there's nothing I fear more than being lonely
Please understand me
Unlock the door

Though singing sounds of tenderness surround you when you speak
Your city lights are blinding, my defenses have grown weak
And all your whirling warmth has danced away from me too soon
The melodies of evening have been silenced by the moon
Come and stand inside the shadows call me to your arms
And you and I will hear the songs of morning being born
It's a cold and ugly city when you're lonely
Please don't ignore me
Unlock the door

Although the crimson curtains of the sunset have been drawn
And everything's uncertain on the doorsteps of the dawn
The way your fingers touched me as I lit your cigarette
Is not the kind of feeling I find easy to forget
But now you've faded back into the crossword puzzle night
And left no hint of how you feel to shield me from the light
I can't sleep I'm too afraid of dreaming lonely
Please don't desert me
Unlock the door

I'm a refugee from stagnancy and no one knows my name
Without the means to make you see I've got no time for games
Your silken hair weaves patterns throught the midnight of my mind
But before my fingers reach to touch you leave me far behind
Aw, lower down compassion ropes and lift me off the ground
And lead me through the funnel of the secrets of your town
In the ocean of your arms I won't be lonely
Don't disregard me
Unlock the door



Yeah she really got the greatest little
Oooo Oooo
She picks me up at night I hear her
She takes me out a ride with her

She's got a motor scooter
With a little rubber tooter
And I fall to the ground
When I hear that sound

Be careful when you hear that little
Oh Yeah
She dont know how to steer that little
And though I really love her little
Oooo Oooo
I've gotta run for cover from her

She's got a little scooter
With a little rubber tooter
And I fall to the ground
When I hear that sound

She said that if you love me true
Ar ya gotta love my tooter too
No matter what I say about it
I can't live with it and I can't live without it

You know I really hate that little
Someday I'm gonna break that little
And though she drives me crazy with her
Oooo Oooo
I've gotta take my baby with her

She's got a motor scooter
With a little rubber tooter
And I fall to the ground
When I hear that sound
Yeah

Umm my babys got the cutest little
Yeah she really got the greatest little
Oooo Oooo
She picks me up at night I hear her
Yeah
She takes me out a ride with her

She's got a motor scooter
With a little rubber tooter
And I fall to the ground
When I hear that sound



On summer's end
So in your absence
I shall begin

When darkness falls
The race is done
And love lives not
When hope is gone

Goodbye, sugar

Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right, baby, you’ll see
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right

The longest night of every year
I spent beside you, baby
Do you remember
Anything about me?

I was the one
When hope was gone
Who took too long
To sing this song

Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right, baby, you’ll see
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right

Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right, baby, you’ll see
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right

Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right

Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right

When darkness falls
On summer's end
So in your absence
I shall begin
When darkness falls
The race is through

Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right

Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right

Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right

Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right
Everything's going to be all right



Bought it at the Five and Dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Hey!

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life - Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69 

Ohh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

Yay!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life - Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69 - Uh hu-huh
It was the summer of '69 - Ohh yeah
Me and my baby in a 69 - Ohhh
It was the summer
Summer, the summer of '69 - Hey



Going to give myself up, up to the truth of what this is, of what I am
Take from me all of my blood, take from me all of my head
This is the best thing I can do
Why is it me instead of you

I come down

Now this is real
I can't go back, caught up with everything here tonight
Going to fuck myself up
Going to throw myself away
Going to give this to you
Give you what I've become

First red on white then red on red
I left my soul back in my bed
This is the best thing I can do
Why is it me instead of you

I come down



I want to take her around the world
But she's so unreliable
She's so unreliable 

And it would be my luck
She only likes me when she gets drunk
And lately she's been thinking
Of giving up drinking 

Come tomorrow
I'll be watching you cry

Always walking in defense
Here they come again
All I want to do was just get home
But I'm pinned to the fence
But here they come again

I walked home all alone

All this and more
All this and more

I guess this is living
Would you come again?
Could you come again?
I never quite feel right
But I come again
Would you come again?

Yes I've become a 
Rock and roll cliche
Because I 'm looking for revenge
And here they come again

I still walk home alone

All this and more
All this and more

I guess this is living
Would you come again?
Could you come again?
I never quite feel right
But I come again
Would you come again?

All this and more
All this and more

I guess this is living
Would you come again?
Could you come again?
I never quite feel right
But I come again
Could you come again?

I guess this is living
Would you come again?
Could you come again?
You never quite feel right
But you come again
Would you come again?



It's a cry of joy.
You don't care what waves have to tell,
They could drive you away.

You want to smile with them,
You got nothing to lose,
You feel so alive.
Cold water on your feet,
Just washing out mistakes,
In times of need.

Come, please, dance me to the end of trouble's coil,
Wet my lips with shining sand and wishful speech.
Catch me, catch me if you can, along the shore,
On the water front we are wed by the sea.

You try to smile with care,
I got something to lose,
We feel so alive.
If sky comes crashing down,
You hold me up so high,
It's time of need.

But it's time to share the truth,
Nothing here will be the same.
Love will wash this all away,
We'll be strong enough to survive.

Come, please, dance me to the end of trouble's coil,
Wet my lips with shining sand and wishful speech.
Catch me, catch me if you can, along the shore,
On the water front we are wed by the sea.



Clue number two was the look that you wore.
And that's when i knew, it was a pretty good sign,
That something was wrong up on cloud number nine

Well it's along way up and we won't come down tonight
Well it may be wrong but baby it sure feels right

And the moon is out and the stars are bright
And whatever comes s'gonna be alright
'Cause tonight you will be mine - up on cloud number nine
And there ain't no place that I'd rather be
And we can't go back but you're here with me
Yeah, the weather is really fine - up on cloud number nine

Now he hurt you, and you hurt me
And that wasn't the way it was supposed to be
So, baby tonight let's leave the world behind
And spend some time up on cloud number nine

Well it's along way up and we won't come down tonight
Well it may be wrong but baby it sure feels right

Well we won't come down tonight
Ya we won't come down tonight
No we won't come down tonight

And the moon is out and the stars are bright
And whatever comes s'gonna be alright
'Cause tonight you will be mine - up on cloud number nine
And there ain't no place that I'd rather be
And we can't go back but you're here with me
Yeah, the weather is really fine - up on cloud number nine

We can watch the world go by - up on cloud number nine...



You won't like the answer
Get up off your chair
There's nothing for you here

Where the guests like souvenirs
They play with you 'till you're all worn out
Back where the guests like souvenirs

Prison color blue
It's a uniform of choice
Count yourself lucky
That you don't write the software

Where the guests like souvenirs
They play with you 'till you're all worn out
Back where the guests like photographs
They hope you had a good night

Loosen up your tie
Make the viewers cry
I cannot pretend to cry

Memorise by heart
Every single part
There's nothing for you here

Where the guests like souvenirs
They play with you 'till you're all worn out
Back where the guests like souvenirs
They hope you had a good night



There ain't no use pretendin',
Don't ya worry - it's only love.

When your world has been shattered,
Ain't nothin' else matters,
It ain't over - it's only love,
And that's all - yeah.

When your heart has been broken,
Hard words have been spoken,
It ain't easy - but it's only love.

And if your life ain't worth livin',
And you're ready to give in,
Just remember - that it's only love.

You can live without the aggravation,
Ya gotta wanna win - ya gotta wanna win.

You keep lookin' back in desperation,
Over and over and over again.

Yeah - oh yeah,
It's only love - Baby,
Oh baby babe - it's only love, love, love,
Love, Love, love.

When your world is shattered,
Ain't nothin' else matters,
It ain't over - it's only love.

If your life ain't worth livin',
And you're ready to give in,
Just remember - that it's only love,
Ya - that's all.

Ya it ain't easy baby,
But it's only love - and that's all.



Modelling for magazines
Nun-Chukka
Things are never quite as they seem
He's got throwing stars
He's got silver tops
Mama's grabbed her jewellery
Hidden in the bathroom
Calling the cops

Bridge
Give me somewhere to go
Don't give me train rides
When the shops are all closed
Don't give me train rides

Never gave anyone the slightest notion
Never showed us that the call was cast
Mama don't want you
Daddy don't want you
Your Motor's running way too fast

Now the Mallway's shuttered
Hanging in the afternoon
Drink a little Vodka
Picking up the old man
Rolling him 'round in her room



This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

In these days of cool reflection
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine

This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free, this world could be one

In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind

Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This should be love for everyone
This world should be free, this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, this could be heaven for everyone
You know that
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone

Listen 
What people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone

This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone



Many men have walked before
And this pain's held
A broken shell
Straight shackled onto the floor

So welcome to the world
That I lived in
Puking up bile and hate
My world has turned
To false inclusion
Sickening broken state

But then I'd see
There's things in me
That make me want it
More than you

But I deny all this
'Cause pain was my bliss
Get wasted on self-destruct

So hold on to the edge

It's all about 
The blood, the sweat, the tears
A tribute to the strength
Built through the years

It's all about 
The blood, the sweat, the tears
A tribute to the strength
Built through the years
A tribute to...

Oh yes I walk the path
That gives me
Confidence strong and pure
Now I realize
That freedom rises
From confronting the source

I built these walls around me
And I can break them all away
I'll focus all the strength I call
Into unstoppable energy

So hold on to the edge

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
A tribute to the strength
Built through the years

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
A tribute to the strength
Built through the years
A tribute to...

Take this
Need focus
Command this
To Take

Hold on
I'm not falling
Please let go

Hold on
I'm not falling
Not falling down again

It's all about 
The blood, the sweat, the tears
A tribute to the strength
Built through the years

It's all about 
The blood, the sweat, the tears
A tribute to the strength
Built through the years

Believe me that
Time will sear the wound
Time will sear the wound
Time will sear the wound



I'll be 'till I don't know when
But supposing now,
You let me choose again

Hands tied, 
Couldn't tell you where I've been
I let the whole thing slide,
Think I could have saved it then

Instead I took the wrong way out
I didn't know wrong until now
I can only see, what I'm meant to see
When it comes round
Instead of breakin' myself down
I took the wrong way out
I took the wrong way out

Faint lines
Marking out another day,
I concede that I,
Just started panicking

In flight
Couldn't think of what to say
Now I know that I,
I should've tried anyway


Instead I took the wrong way out
I didn't know wrong until now
I can only see, what I'm meant to see
When it comes round
Instead of breakin' myself down
I took the wrong way out
I took the wrong way out

I can't take another day, livin' with this weight
Of knowin' that I put space between me and you
So I'll wait for a break for an opening
You might let me get back through


Instead I took the wrong way out
I didn't know wrong until now
I can only see, what I'm meant to see
When it comes round
Instead of breakin' myself down
I took the wrong way out
I took the wrong way out

I know I know I know
I know I know I know
I took the wrong way,
I took the wrong way out

La da da dat da dat da
La da da dat da dat da
I-I-I I took the wrong way out

La da da dat da dat da
La da da dat da dat da



you and I would be friends
I'll never say never again
I've spent hours on the phone
and all the rest 
I guess I bleed the best
And every night it's plain to see 
it wasn't meant to be

After all is said and done, it's over after all
You barely cried as you waved goodbye

It all comes out in the wash
Who would've guessed it would wind up like this
It's better than never again
I've spent hours in the rain and dried out somehow
I'd rather plead the fifth

And every time the morning comes 
I wonder what I've done

After all is said and done, it's over after all
You barely cried as you waved goodbye
It all comes out in the wash

Empty cars and phone booth scars
Knuckles on the mend
Every time I go too far I'd rather wind up
Rather wind up dead

I should've guessed it would end up like this
I'll never say never again 

After all is said and done, it's over after all
You barely cried as you waved goodbye
It all comes out in the wash



And times we had when you were mine 

This is all you're hoping for 
This is all you want and more 
Behind the times we had when you were mine 

Come on, come on what are you waiting for
Feel your heartbeat, baby you want more
Come on, come on blood, sweat, and fears
We're leaving everything right here

Tonight, tonight
We'll make the best of broken time 
Bury baited hooks and rhymes behind 
The Innocence of feeling fine

This is all you're hoping for 
This is all you want and more 
Behind the innocence of feeling fine

Come on, come on what are you waiting for
Feel your heartbeat, baby you want more
Come on, come on blood, sweat, and fears
We're leaving everything right here

Let your body move, oh oh
Let your body move, oh oh

Come on, come on what are you waiting for
Feel your heartbeat, baby you want more
Come on, come on blood, sweat, and fears
We're leaving everything right here



The air is thick in here; no windows open light is dim.
With radiation ray, keeps my feet on common ground.
Time has been delayed; the doors shut don't make a sound.

Stuck here forver
Waiting for the never

There's always room in here for one more.
Don't listen to the wake up call.
I'll still be here just waiting.
There's always room in here for one more.
Don't listen to the wake up call.
I'll still be here just waiting.

The day has come to pass, the night's slowly creeping out.
But I'm the only one, who's up, down, over and out. 
If there were only just one more, it would make this room complete.
Then maybe just some how, we'd all get some sleep.

Stuck here forver
Waiting for the never

There's always room in here for one more.
Don't listen to the wake up call.
I'll still be here just waiting.
There's always room in here for one more.
Don't listen to the wake up call.
I'll still be here just waiting.

Stuck here forver 
Stuck here forever
Stuck here forever
Waiting for the never

There's always room in here for one more 
Don't listen to the wake up call
I'll still be here just waiting.
There's always room in here for one more.
Don't listen to the wake up call.
I'll still be here just waiting.
Be here just waiting.



Wouldn't like to tell you twice
Hey mac, get off my back
Didn't ask your advice
There's all this heat
Out in the street
Telling us to move along
 
It's gonna be a long hot summer
From now on
 
Hey man, I don't understand
We ain't hardly bothering you
Say fag, you're just a drag
We ain't nearly finished with you
There's all this heat
Out on the beat
Telling us we don't belong
 
It's gonna be a long hot summer
From now on
 
Hey Dan, give us a hand
We won't make it alone
But we can all make a stand
Next time the whistle's blown
So get your feet
Out on the street
When you hear the heat is on
 
It's gonna be a long hot summer
From now on
It's gonna be a long hot summer
From now on

Look out sisters
Look out brothers
We won't be fooled again



Taking names and playing games is her passion
But her perfect world started coming apart
The day I broke her cold heart

Now she's hungry for the blood of any boy
And she'll get it 'cause she gets what she wants
She's a devil in black stilettos
Don't cross her, she's a fully loaded debutante

Everybody run, everybody run
She looks so sweet when she's having fun
Everybody run, everybody
The homecoming queen has got a gun

She's a killer made of spice and sugar
Hand grenades for promenades better suit her
But her perfect world started coming apart
The day I broke her cold heart

Now her enemy is our society
She'll suck you in, then she'll blow you away
She's a devil in black stilettos
Don't raise your glass, her cocktail's spiked with glycerin

Everybody run, everybody run
She looks so sweet when she's having fun
Everybody run, everybody
The homecoming queen has got a gun

It's a love-hate masquerade
And she's got you in her sights
A love-hate masquerade
And she's got you in her sights

She's got a gun

Everybody run, everybody run
She looks so sweet when she's having fun
Everybody run, everybody
The homecoming queen has got a gun!



Whiplash aerial, racing trim
Cortina owner - no one meaner
Wish that I could be like him
 
Twin exhaust and rusty bumper
Chewing gum at traffic light
Stop at red but leave on amber
Grey Cortina outa sight
 
Wish I had a grey Cortina
Whiplash aerial, racing trim
Cortina owner - no one meaner
Wish that I could be like him
 
Furlined seats and lettered windscreen
Elbow on the windowsill
Eight track blazing Brucie Springsteen
Bomber jacket, dressed to kill
 
Wish I had a grey Cortina
Whiplash aerial, racing trim
Cortina owner - no one meaner
Wish that I could be like him
 
Never cop a parking ticket
Never seem to show its age
Speed police too slow to nick it
Grey Cortina got it made
 
Wish I had a grey Cortina
Whiplash aerial, racing trim
Cortina owner - no one meaner
Wish that I could be like him



You don't love me
Yes I know
Uh-uh-uh
You don't love me
Yes I know 

Well you left me pretty baby
And I had no place to go
Yes I love you
I'll do anything you say
Yes I love you
I'll do anything you say
If you say you love me baby
I'll get on my knees and pray 

Uh uh uh
You don't love me
Yes I know
Uh-uh-uh
You don't love me
Yes I know 

Uh uh uh
You don't love me



You need laughs, 'cause you don't need misery
Just tell me what you need, I'll tell it all
Screw the facts, I can give you fantasy


My magazine, I'm talking about my magazine...

Just tell me what you want, I print it all
You need help, it's a sick society
Just tell me what you need, I sell it all
Who needs friends, I'm collecting enemies




Why do you grind me small
Hard on me, hard on me
At every fence I fall

I bite my rage
I stop my breath
I shake my cage
I swim with emptiness

Hard on me, hard on me
Like they were hard on you
Hard on me, hard on me
So I can stumble too

My circuits seize
My senses jam
I don't know who to please
Trapped inside the Wicker Man

You're so hard on me
You're so hard on me
You're so hard on me

Hard on me, hard on me
Why do you grind me small
Hard on me, hard on me
At every fence I fall 

Unzip my heart
Unbraid my veins
Unstitch my wantonness
And loosen up my reins
Before I dare
Go on that hill
In dumb despair
Unfreeze my will

You're so hard on me
You're so hard on me
You're so hard on me



Another mangled plot, I wanna make it right
'cause everybody knows just what nobody says
You're gonna have to grow out of an unmade bed

And this is just the final curtain call
After such a long, elaborate fall
I was only fighting for my life
But now I want a chance to make it right

Well can you touch your nose and take a long, last look
At your understated pose your never-written book
Well i'm better off without that overrated truth
You gotta watch your mouth, it catches up to you

This is just the final curtain call
After such a long, elaborate fall
I was only fighting for my life
But now I want a chance to make it right

Well so long to the life you wrote about
Your head hung over porcelain, no doubt
And face-down on a dirty floor you find
The same things that you thought you'd left behind

This is just the final curtain call
After such a long, elaborate fall
I was only fighting for my life
But now I want a chance to make it right

..curtain call
After such a long, elaborate fall
I was only fighting for my life
But now I want a chance to make it right chance to make it right
A chance to make it right
It's all right, it's all right all right
All right all right
It's all right, all right
It's all right, all right



Like an arrow that's racing to it's target 
I got you in my sight 
I am fixed on you 
And I can feel you calling looking for me too 

Nothing's gonna stop me 'cause I'm on a mission 
I'm getting ready for a demolition 

Collide, crash into me 
Collide, I want to be broken by you 
And made brand new 
Collide 

In the aftermath of your hurricane 
It won't be what I lost but what I stand to gain 
So bring your storm to me 'cause I know when it's through 
The clouds will roll away 
As sky will turn to blue 

Nothing's gonna stop me I know what I'm doing 
Make something beautiful from out of the ruins 

Collide, crash into me 
Collide, I want to be broken by you 
And made brand new 
Collide 

Rearrange me 
Only you can save me 

Collide, crash into me 
Collide, I want to be broken by you 
And made brand new 
Collide



Love has come courting and I'm back there again
I pour myself a brand new start
Glad to be falling for the beauty within

All the king's horses - all the king's men

I'm on the outside looking in
Over and over and over again
There's no telling where I've been
How I returned here - how much I have seen

All the king's horses - all the king's men

I'll weave a circle round the sun
Throw down my arms and give my all
I'll be your soldier of love

I'll weave a circle round the sun
Throw down my arms and give my all
I'll be your soldier of love
I am your soldier of love

Glad to be falling for the beauty within
The beauty within, the beauty within



Won't get home at a hundred o'clock
Nobody goin' to satisfy me
Except you and the baby and the colour TV

I was always in my prime
Now I'm falling over the line
They boys are sad to have to let me go
But you got it all to get me home

'Cause you quiet me down
I been all over the place and I ain't found anyone
Can keep my feet on the ground, no

We can be bigger than my old habits
Over my dead body but still
If I am awake in the morning
We'll be royal in the afternoon

You'll be the Queen and I'll be the mad King of it all

The words of a drunk fade with the light
Satan delivers and the goods are alright
He's at home now counting the dough
I'm standing here for another last throw

We can be bigger than my old habits
Over my dead body but still
If I am awake in the morning
We'll be royal in the afternoon



Guess this is what love is all about
I missed on monday, a terrible tuesday
Maybe someday I can work it out
But here we go again, it's finally sinking in

Thats just my kind of luck
But I'm not given up
I don't know what I'm thinkin
She got over me
Thats no way to look
When you start addin up
I guess I must be dreamin
She got over me
Whoa I'm over this feelin

Yes I'll admit it hard to handle it
I stood my ground, anything goes now
You don't ever let it get me down
Maybe someday I can work it out
But here we go again
Whoa it's finally sinkin in

Thats just my kind of luck
But I'm not given up
I don't know what I'm thinkin
She got over me
Thats no way to look
When you start addin up
I guess I must be dreamin
She got over me
Whoa I'm over this feelin

Are you starin at the ceilin?
Are you counting all the stars?
Knowing I'm there in your heart
All is fair in love and war, you'll find your way
Thanks for the battle scars

Thats just my kind of luck
But I'm not given up
I don't know what I'm thinkin
She got over me
Thats no way to look
When you start addin up
I guess I must be dreamin
She got over me
She got over me
Whoa I'm over this feelin
She got over me



I remeber only too well

The girl's a fool
She broke the rule
She hurt him hard
This time you will break down
She's lost his trust
And so she must
All is lost
The system has broke down

Romance has broke down
This boy is crackin up
This boy has broke down

She plays it hard, she plays it tough
But that's enough, the love is over
Shes broke his heart and that is rough
But in the end you'll soon recover

The romance is over
This boy is crackin up
This boy has broken down
This boy is crackin up
This boy has broke down

I've been spending my money
In the old town
It's not the same honey
When you're not around
I've been spending my time
In the old town
I sure miss you honey
Now you're not around
Now you're not around
This old town

Ola, Ola

This boy is crackin up
This boy has broken down
This boy is crackin up
This boy has broke down x3

fade



anyway...

Just close your eyes
and speak 
Say what we both
know is inside you

If you want I'll keep 
So much 
Bury Deep 

Wake up its gone 
What made you fall away ? 
What came undone? 
What made you fall away? 

We were so true
We were pure

You saw how my heart 
Was full of hurt 
I held you to stop
breaking down around me 

I tried , I was weak 
Just close your eyes and speak 

Wake up its gone 
What made you fall away ? 
What came undone? 
What made you fall away? 

Feelings I keep 
Bury so deep
You feel from me
You breathed so deep 
You loved so deep 

I built all these walls to keep you close



A sunny day, 
Walking through the country. 

Just a breeze, 
And I feel at ease, 
Walkin' through the country. 

Blades of grass, 
Playin' with my feet, 
There's nothing so sweet, 
As the way you treat me. 

Walkin' through the country, 
Walkin' through the country, 
Walkin' through the country! 

Ohhh, feelin' good, 

I know there's someone, 
Someone who needs you. 
Walkin' through the country together, 
My love's gonna, 
Comfort you. 

Oh, what a groovy day, 
A sunny day. 
Walkin' through the country. 

Just a breeze, 
And I feel at ease, 
Walkin' through the country. 

Blades of grass, 
Playin' with my feet, 
There's nothing so sweet, 
As the way you treat me. 

Walkin' through the country, 
Walkin' through the country, 
You're walkin' through the country! 

Sing it! 
Sing it! 
Sing it! 

Keep walkin', baby. 
Feels good now, doesn't it?



Meet me at the gate
There's nowhere to go
I can't be late

I feel cool, alive
Aware that I’m sinking
The firmament is swallowing me whole
And I’m on a roll again

Come little lately get your shine on
Kiss my pretty face
And let me bleed a while
The people want a taste, so taste me

I feel cool, I get around
My blood they want to steal it
A lonely boy will stand when others crawl
And I can feel them coming at me

Esta noche
All the lights will breathe the same air
As I behold the view

Come little lately get your shine on
Step out of the shade
And let me breathe a while
For god has come to play, so play me

The air, the night
My blood you're going to feel it
The everlasting love has turned to snow
And I want to feel it all over

Never, no one
I wait ever
I feel this light
But I conceal
No one complete
This mess, replete
Perfumed in mud
Christened by a wave
A wave
A wave
This is never lasting love



My body burned by the sun, burned by the sun
As I defrost beside the fire
I contemplate my escape
Played my mistakes
Around and around and around

It's just like real life
Tastes just like real life
Feels just like real life on the road

I'm alive, scream alive
My body sprays out a spark
Sprays out a spark
Burning a hole in the dark

It's just like real life
Tastes just like real life
Feels just like real life

My body sprays out a spark
Sprays out a spark

Yeah let me burn in the sun
Burn in the sun oooh

It's just like real life
Tastes just like real life
Feels just like real life
On the road



She said those kids she's with were selling it
So we sailed off on some separate trips
She got pinned down at the party pit

I went away to school that fall
She stuck around with all those stickpin dolls
Sped through the scene until the engine stalled
At some suburban shopping mall

Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit
Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit

I came back to start a band, of course
I saw her walking through the crystal court
She made a scene by the revolving doors
She's gonna walk around and drink some more

So we walked across that Grain Belt bridge
Into bright new Minneapolis
She said, 

Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit
Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit

Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit
Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down and I'm pretty sure we kissed

And I'm pretty sure we kissed

Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more

Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
I'm gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more

Gonna walk around, gonna walk around
Gonna walk around and drink
Gonna walk around, gonna walk around
Gonna walk around and drink

Gonna walk around, gonna walk around
Gonna walk around and drink
Gonna walk around, gonna walk around
Gonna walk around and drink

Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more



I poured myself into the street
I watched the world from off a cloud
I saw the people quarrelling out loud

So sad, the wind
A brighter day will come again

Shut out the lights, turn down the bed
Whatever gets you through your head
Unlock the door, throw away the key
We don't want the spirits watching
As they hover over you and me

And as they dance
They call their way around
They come, they often go
They know, they often go low

My little girl, where did you go?
I cannot find you any more
Angel sweet, angel bright
Come on back to me
I promise you the wall will fall with me

The way, I’m going down
This time, this time, I’m going down
I can't fight, I’m going down
Goodbye



If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's try-in' to tear us apart

Fare thee well, I know you're leavin'
I know you're leavin'
For the new love that you've found
The handsome guy that you've been dating, whoa
I got a feelin' he's gonna put you down 'cause

He don't love you like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's try-in' to tear us apart

He uses all the great quotations
Says the things I wish I could say
Whoa, but he's has so many rehearsals
Girl, to him it's just another play but wait

When the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
Girl, I'll be there to take you home

He don't love you and he never will like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
Oh, he don't love you, girl, like I love you
He's try-in' to tear us apart

Whoa, he don't love you



Down, down, always down Always make the same mistake
Talk is cheap, but you're talking fast
Never take the time to think of where it will end
Walking tall, don't look back
I don't know which way it's gonna lead, me baby
I try so hard but I can't understand
Lead, me baby
Just help me get my feet on the ground
Down, down, down Wanderin' through the places that we both used to go
Round, round always round Chase me and sedate me now but don't let me go
Restless sleep, locked in my lonely room
Empty arms are waiting for the morning to come
In the deep, where my dreams come true
Take care now, keep you now, but
Lead me baby
I try so hard but I can't understand
Lead, me baby
Oh, but help me get my feet on the ground, yes, help me
Oh, help me baby, oh help me
I can't stay down for too long now baby
I can't stay down for too long now baby
No, yeah, whoa yes
If I cry  well, it's, it's 'cos I'm lonely
You know I'm only ever lonely without you
If I cry well, it's 'cos I'm lonely
'Cos I can be so lonely, I can be, I can be, I can be ...
Push, push, push, ooh



Everybody was crying it seemed like sadness had surrounded the town
Me I went to the liquor store
And I bought a bottle of wine and a bottle of gin
I played his records all night
Drinking with a close, close friend

Now some people say that that ain't right
And some people say nothing at all
But even in the darkest of night
You can always hear the king's call
You can always hear the king's call

Well they put him away in Memphis
Six feet beneath the clay
Everybody was crying
Everybody said it was a plain grey day

Me I went to the liquor store
And I bought another bottle of wine and another bottle of gin
I played his records all night
And I got drunk all over again

Now some people say that that ain't right
That ain't right
And some people say nothing at all
I say nothing
But even in the darkest of night
You could always hear the king's call
You could always hear the king's call

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
And I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you

Now some people say that that ain't right
And some people say nothing at all I say nothing
But even in the darkest of night
You could always hear the king's call
You could always hear the king's call
You could always hear the king's call
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing here
They might as well bring the curtain down
I cried the night the king died



He said he'd have a heart attack
If he didn't lay down
The years went by and he settled down
His house is on the edge of town
And you're so proud
You never bit off more than you could chew
You never gave out more than inconveniences you

In olden days he made enough 
To build a car that runs on dust
But it ran out
Now we've got oceanic hydroponics 
Bringin' back the great relax from way back when
And do you think that this will last?
Of course!
And how do you really know? 
We'll use force.

Even marathon runners need to nap
I ran all the way there
And then ran back
And back was gone
Defenestrate my old ways
Grand Canyon, all the lovely days 
And then dive in

Oh, that's my dad in the yellow shirt 
He won the race, and then the girl
And they made me
Ineffable is life and death 
Let's talk until we run out of breath
And just run along
Just run along x4

Even marathon runners need to nap
I ran all the way there
And then ran back
And back was gone



We found tomorrow - By building on our past,
We paid our dues - We stick together - Come whatever.

We're still standin' - Didn't fall to pieces,
Never lost our reason - Never stopped believin'.

We found our wings, now we fly above the wind,
You and me - We found what we're looking for.

We gave it all - Gave our very best,
With every fall - We withstood the test,
We broke the rules - Had to do it - To get through it.

We found our wings, together we found everything,
You and me - We found what we're looking for,
You made me shine - Picked me up when I fell behind,
With you - I never need to search no more.

We're still standin' - Didn't fall to pieces,
Never lost our reason - Never stopped believin',
Ahh never stopped - believin'.

We found our wings, together we found everything,
You and me - We found what we're looking for,
You made me shine - Picked me up when I fell behind,
With you - I never need to search no more,
You and me, we found what we were looking for.



We would soon move to Oregon.
Pulled from the ground of yesterday
Sell everything and move away.

But it wasn't what we thought
And we rode the horse that Bud bought.
We took that trip again, my friend.

Ten of us formed a family
Jimmy and Jesus under siege.
Follow the leader it would go
Stuck in a twisted puppet show.

But it wasn't what we thought
And we rode the horse that Bud bought.
We took that trip again, my friend.

But it wasn't all for naught
Living in the house that Bud bought.
We learned so very much back then.

It was a burning bush of hungry souls
Trying to follow what our hearts were told.
But a novice played upon our fears
And the whole thing screwed us up for years.

We untied a holy knot
And we rode the horse that Bud bought.

Prophecy came and we were gone
We would soon move from Oregon.
Turning their backs on yesterday
Some of the others fell away...



I'm not asking for anything.

I'm alone and self-anaemic,
But sometimes you wake up,
If I could hold this hope inside my hands,
You'd understand they let us down.

I'm not asking for much,
I'm not asking for anything.

I won't waste a moment,
I won't waste a moment with fear.

We're alone or self-anaemic,
But sometimes we win,

I'm not asking for much,
I'm not asking for anything.

I won't waste a moment,
I won't waste a moment.

I could run,
I could run,
I could run,
I could run,
Let me go.

Just cover up your eyes,
So I can make sense of it all,
Waking me up,
Just shut your eyes,
So I can make sense of it all.



The light you shed, it overflows my eyes, 
Can't take your blinding glow
No, oh no

If I could break into your mind
I'd leave a note that said you were like
The star of all the planets out in the sky
Tell me why


Don't you feel lovely?
Don't you feel bright?
You've got that something 
I only wish you could see 
How lovely you are to me
Ooh, You're lovely

If you could spy with your pretty eyes
What I can see as your very own satellite
Maybe you would get it and you'd realize, oh
You're the star of all the planets out in the sky
Tell me why 



How lovely you are to me
Oh, you're the star of all the planets of the sky, 
You're the star of all the planets of the sky
You shine so bright





Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here come Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnel trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah the boy can play
A dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
And he do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Here comes Johnny gonna tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat the talkin' blues
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah the boy can play
A dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
Then he do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here come Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnel, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah the boy can play
A dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life
Mm, you do the walk of life







Whispering my name and laughing
Edging up the hall into my bed
Faces on the walls are screaming
Drifting out across the ceiling
Dropping off and falling in my head
All alone
They cut the phones
But then again
There's no-one left to ring
There's going to be no peace
til the bones break through my skin
Another night in Another night in
I shiver within
A slow hand-clap begins
Another night in Another night in
My skeleton is waiting in the wings
of a skeleton grin
Oh no
And I don't know where he stops and I begin
A hundred million bugs are crawling
In and out of every opening
Up and down and over me all night
Looking through my old scrapbook
I search in vain for pleasant memory
Tearing out my hair til it gets light
All alone
I'm heard to groan
My epitaph
'I regret everything'
There's going to be no sleep til the bones
break through my skin
Another night in Another night in
I shiver within
A slow hand clap begins
Another night in Another night in
My skeleton is waiting in the wings of a skeleton grin
Oh no
Cause I don't know where he stops and I begin
It's just Another night in Another night in
I shiver within
A slow hand clap begins
Another night in Another night in
My skeleton is eager in the wings



The kids came from miles around to get messed up on the music
And she drove down from Bowdoin with a carload of girlfriends
To meet some boys and maybe eat some mushrooms

And they did and she got sick, now she's pinned and way too shaky
She don't want to tell the doctor everything she's taken 
The paramedics hovered over like a somber mourning family
They gave her activated charcoal, they flooded her with saline

I got really hot and then I came to in the chillout tent
They gave me oranges and cigarettes

He was rough around the edges, he'd been to school but never finished
He'd been to jail but never prison
And it was his first day off in forever, man, the festival seemed like a pretty good plan 
Cruise some chicks and get a suntan

And his friend gave him four but he said, 
But then he got bored and he ended up taking all four
So now my man he ain't that bored, anyways
The paramedics found him, he was shaking on the side of the stage

Everything was spinning and then I came to in the chillout tent
They gave me oranges and cigarettes
I got really hot and then I came to in the chillout tent
They gave us oranges and cigarettes

She looked just like a baby bird
All new and wet and trying to light a Parliament
He quoted her some poetry, he's Tennyson in denim and sheepskin
He looked a lot like Izzy Stradlin

They started kissing when the nurses took off their IVs
It was kind of of sexy but it was kind of creepy
Their mouths were fizzy with the cherry cola
They had the privacy of bedsheets and all the other kids were mostly in comas

He was kind of cute, we kind of kicked it in the chillout tent
And I never saw that boy again
She was pretty cool, we kind of kicked it in the chillout tent
And I never saw that girl again

He was kind of cute, we kind of kicked it in the chillout tent
And I never saw that boy again
She seemed pretty cool, we kind of kicked it in the chillout tent
And I never saw that girl again



I couldn't stand up looking up at a faded party

It was a mistake pageant
It was a mistake from the start
This is a mistake pageant
But it's unsuitable to laugh like the others

Couldn't stand up looking up, I'm at a faded party
I couldn't stand up looking at, at a famous party

It was a mistake pageant
It was a mistake from the start
This is a mistake pageant
And I don't understand the way that you're living

Because you've had bad luck Disorder
And I know what it feels like to have bad luck

You can't open your eyes
You can't open your eyes
It's vain or is it just fame?

It was a mistake pageant
It was a mistake from the start
This is a mistake pageant
And I don't understand this way that you're living

Because you've had bad luck Disorder
And I know what it feels like to have bad luck

I hope that this won't bring you down
These people are obscured by frowns
This won't bring you down
These people, frown

Cause you've had bad luck Disorder
And I know what it feels like to have bad luck



How do you make this thing slow down?

We tried to brake
By saying, "Must be some mistake."
Problem unsolved
We said, "Don't make me get involved."

How do you slow this thing down?
How do you make this thing slow down?

We tried to slow it down
By shrieking, "No, no, no."
We tried to halt
By whimpering, "It's not my fault."

How do you slow this thing down?
How do you make this thing slow down?

It's not fair
We've tried all kinds of prayer
We've tried science
It sped up in defiance

How do you slow this thing down?
How do you make this thing slow down?



From a friend who isn't kind
A friend in need or a friend that you need
Who can help you through the troubled times

So reach on out and take a hold of my hand
And let me know that you're ready to go
There ain't no dues and you can leave your blues behind

And have a little peace, just a little peace of mind
Give me some peace, peace of mind

There comes a time when your friends go blind
And their words become diseased
They threaten your life with the blade of a knife
And set you down upon your knees

Make no mistake for your very own sake
Heres a little word for now
Take off your shoes and let your thoughts be kind

And have a little peace, just a little peace of mind
Peace, peace of mind, make us feel better

Some folks you find speak a mighty good line
They charm you all the way
They take you along on a sweet, sweet song
Then they steal your heart away

But blessed be the one who can understand why
People have to act that way
'Cause if I knew I wouldn't even want to say

But have a little peace, just a little peace of mind
Give me some peace, yeah, peace of mind

Everybody wants peace, peace of mind
Peace, peace of mind
Peace, peace of mind
Peace, peace of mind
Peace, peace of mind

Everybody wants peace, peace of mind
Everybody needs peace, peace of mind
All we need is some peace



I think we're lost, don't worry
I've been here before
I'm sure I thought I knew the way
Out of here yesterday
Dove cuesto mi dolce?
Your driver called, it's time to go
Your driver's waiting for you

And I caught a fever
A holy fire
Till I was crawling
On the ceiling
Come out of your hole
I know you know
You know I know
I want to go

Such a pretty thing I’ve never seen
Someone so perfectly deceive
I loved her smile
And her beguiling way with me
She smelled exciting, I wanted some
Your driver's gone, like everybody

And that's why I need you
To catch on fire
I want you to burn me
Till I feel it
I know you know
Which way to go
I want you to show me
So I can steal it
Where should we go?
Where should we go?
I know you know
That I’m going to need it
I know you know
Which way to go
I know you know
I want to go



It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic

One dream, one soul, one prize
One goal, one golden glance of what should be
It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
It's challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
It's challenging the doors of time

It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be
Will soon be gone
This is a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone

Magic - it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic
It's magic
It's a kind of magic



Do you believe in anything?
Do you carry it around just to burn things down?

Meet me tonight on the turnpike, my darling
'Cause we believe in everything
If we sweat all these debts, then we're sure to drown
So we strap ourselves up to this engine now
With a god who we found laying under the back seat

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You were freezing over hell
You were bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say

Help
All that you've got is to ignore the things, that I was sorry
And sweep me under the rug
While you're beating with a book everyone, the book tells you to love

There is an ember in the heart of the kiln
And it's burning hot with love
Burning out my sins until there's nothing but dust
Holding me with care into your cigarette
'Cause the god I believe in, he worked on a campaign trail

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You were freezing over hell
You were bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say

Who do you carry the torch for, my young man?
Do you believe in anything?
Do you carry it around just to burn things to the ground?

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You were freezing over hell
You were bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say

Feels like
What did you learn tonight?
We could escape the armor
You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
I might throw it away
For fear of the silver sun
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say

If you try
You were freezing over hell
Running a maze of your lies
You were bringing on the end, you do so well
It's too hard to save
You've thrown out everyone
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say



doesn't matter to us anyway 
you know we're going to find a better way 
i said a better way 

By your side 
lead the way if i get lost 
and i'll help you at any cost

We always watch the Queen on Christmas Day
Won't you stay?

Though your eyes see shipwrecked sailors you're still dry
The outlook's fine though Wales might have some rain
Saved again

Let's skip the news boy I'll make some tea
The Arabs and the Jews boy too much for me
They get me confused boy puts me off to sleep
And the thing I hate - Oh Lord!
Is staying up late to watch some debate on some nation's fate

Hypnotised by Batman, Tarzan, still surprised!
You've won the West in time to be our guest
Name your prize!

Drop of wine, a glass of beer dear, what's the time?
The grime on the Tyne is mine all mine all mine
Five past nine

Blood on the rooftops - Venice in the Spring
Streets of San Francisco - a word from Peking
The trouble was started by a young Errol Flynn
Better in my day - Oh Lord!
For when we got bored, we'd have a world war, happy but poor

So let's skip the news boy I'll go make that tea
Blood on the rooftops too much for me
When old Mother Goose stops - they're out for twenty-three
Then the rain at Lords stopped play
Seems Helen of Troy has found a new face again



if not, give them your hands
so they can take control
give them a price so they can buy your soul
don't get to low
proudly you brag 'bout the things you done
yeah, right, money protects your fall
give it all up, give it all up
give it up, give it all up
yeah, yeah you got to give it all up
oh oh let them take your soul
oh oh let them take control
I guess you like what you've got
if not, pay attention to what's been told
make up your mind before the game is sold
it's up to you
yeah
stay on track and you won't get lost



All, all for the future free, free, so free

For god we stood
The right and the good
Do as we should

Just for you, my boy
Keep you from the commie ploy
Just for you, my girl
When I'm dead and gone

All, all for the future free, free, so free
All, all for the future free, free, so free

Do as it takes
For all our sakes
Must save our race

Just for the Union Jack
Don't you feel so proud of that?
Just for the Stars and Stripes
We'd pay the highest price

The future free

All, all for the future free, free, so free
All, all for the future free, free, so free



I tell you the town looked good
Walking lonely avenues
Where rhinestone cowboys find the blues

There's people in doing their thing
Getting all the mozzarella in
And the passing time and phasing moons
Words flying in cloudy rooms

Plastic bags, milk, and eggs
The poor old crone's got aching legs
How I would love to speak
To everybody on the street

Just for once to break the rules
I know it would be so cool
From Willesden to Cricklewood
From Willesden to Cricklewood

From Willesden to Cricklewood
Come with me and be no good
Be a madman on the street
Sing something out like reet petite

Let's hip hop at traffic lights
Ten thumbs up and smiling bright
Crossing all the great divides
Color, age, and heavy vibes

From Willesden to Cricklewood
I tell you the town looked good
From Willesden to Cricklewood
From Willesden to Cricklewood

Oh, let's go down to Al Rashid's
All the Aussie lagers are on me
Now you've got the absinthe out
Your old mother, she wants a stout

From Willesden to Cricklewood
As I went, it all looked good
Thought about my babies grown
Thought about going home

Thought about what's done is done
We're alive and that's the one
From Willesden to Cricklewood
From Willesden to Cricklewood

Oh, let's go down to Al Rashid's
All the Aussie lagers are on me
Now you've got the Absinthe out
Your old mother, she wants a stout

From Willesden to Cricklewood
I tell you the town looked good
From Willesden to Cricklewood
From Willesden to Cricklewood



But in reality
Life has never been fun
Working for the bread
Might as well be dead
But life has just begun

Keep in touch with them
Old friends have never been
What I look forward to do
Time was drudgery
Pure insanity
But then I met you

You were what I've been looking for
Now I know what I want to do
Now I got you I'll never leave you
It's true, it's true
New love always feels so good

Can't imagine
How I survived
Without you
It couldn't be done

Feeling confident
Now I always spend
Time just having fun

The first time ever
I know forever
With you, yeah, it feels so good
Now I got you I'll never leave you
It's true, it's true
New love always feels so good

You were what I've been looking for
Now I know what I want to do
Now I got you I'll never leave you
It's true, it's true
New love always feels so good

It's true, it's true
New love always feels so good



Well, I had such a dream when I woke I was weepin'
The vision I saw danced around me
And my heart saw the things that my eyes couldn't see

Oh, the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood-red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screamin'

Come one, come all, come see and believe it
The truth will shine, if you open you eyes
And you'll see it move as it moves on the masses
The weak will rise and give birth to the sky
And give birth to the sky

No, it didn't stop there, it consumed me
And it crushed me with joy as it's beauty swept through me
I was moved by the weight of it all
I'd been touched by the light, yes I know what I saw

Oh, the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood-red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screamin'

Come one, come all, come see and believe it
The truth will shine if you open you eyes
And you'll see it move as it moves on the masses
The weak will rise and give birth to the sky
And give birth to the sky

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

I saw the dreamers dreamin'
I heard the people singin'
The dinosaurs are dyin'
The mind controls subsidin'
I saw a new path beatin'
Free thinkers freely thinkin'
Can't stop a thought from breathin'
It moves like fire

The sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood-red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screamin'

Come one, come all, come see and believe it
The truth will shine if you open you eyes
And you'll see it move as it moves on the masses
The weak will rise and give birth to the sky

And give birth to the sky



That brings a grown man to his knees
A love that tastes as sweet as honey
Let me have some, won't you please?

Say the word and I'll come runnin'
On the straight and true
Are you ready for my lovin'
Like I'm ready for you?

If by chance we stay together
You and I can have it all
But I'm afraid you'll find another
Before we've had a chance to fall

You've already got me dreamin'
Of all that we would do
Are you ready for my lovin'
Like I'm ready for you?

I wanna know if you're ready for love this strong
Someone who knows you
On cold nights will hold you
And never ever leave you all alone

You're my million dollar baby
You're the smile that lights the room
You're the fire that burns inside me
Oh, you're the one that hung the moon

You say the word and I'll come runnin'
On the straight and true
Are you ready for my lovin'
Like I'm ready for you? Like I'm ready for you
Like I'm ready for you, like I'm ready for you



Perfect in the place where you are
Comfortable, I guess, but no man is an island
Breaking waves and shooting at stars

Paperback is done, so move out to the corner
Dive into the sea of the crowd
Say it's all been done and life is made to order
Counting cracks and thinking out loud

But if you awake with a shake and a shiver
From down in the depths of the mess you've seen
Just leave it behind, close your eyes and remember
It's only a dream

The story will unfold, prince will turn to pauper
Jumpin' to conclusions too soon
Merry marigold, there's nothing left to offer
 resemble cartoons

But if you awake with a shake and a shiver
From down in the depths of the mess you've seen
Just leave it behind, close your eyes and remember
It's only a dream, it's only a dream

And if you awake with a shake and a shiver
From down in the depths of the mess you've seen
Just leave it behind, close your eyes and remember
It's only a dream

Yeah, if you awake with a shake and a shiver
From down in the depths of the mess you've seen
Just leave it behind, close your eyes and remember
It's only a dream, it's only a dream, it's only a



So many lines that i don't understand
All i want is my sweet paradise
The secret lies behind your dark blue eyes
Hold me closer and look up in the skies
Give me sweet little lies

Can you tell me where to go
Can you tell me where to be
Will you open up a door for me, and guarantee
That you'll let me stay inside

Can you tell me where to run
Can you tell me where to hide
Can you put all my troubles aside, and be my guide
Please help me fly away

Your crystal-ball, will it ever show
What i need to know
When its time to let go

Every time and then i need to break free
From my steady decline, to where i want to be

At the end of the day
I'm still miles away

Can you tell me where to go
Can you tell me where to be
Will you open up a door for me, and guarantee
That you'll let me stay inside

Can you tell me where to run
Can you tell me where to hide
Can you put all my troubles aside, and be my guide
Please help me fly away

Chasing rainbows, but i'm wondering why
I can still remeber every mountain i've climbed
What will i find above the cloudy skies

Can you tell me where to be
Will you open up a door for me, and guarantee
That you'll let me stay inside

Can you tell me where to run
Can you tell me where to hide
Can you put all my troubles aside, and be my guide
Please help me fly away

Tell me where to go...

Tell me where to go...



Just like you came to me
Take a bow, you take a bow
Your spirits left with me

Watch the clouds making shapes
And picture me with you
I'm so alive, I'm so alive
You color up my world

Halleluiah was all that I could sing
Halleluiah

You shine, I shine.
My dear, my life
Is washed up like a seashell longing to be dry
So please shine, please shine.

Reverie, your reverie is full of all of me
Walk around my town all day
We pretend to run away

Hallelujah was all that I could sing
Hallelujah

You shine, I shine.
My dear, my life
Is washed up like a seashell longing to be dry
So please shine, please shine so bright.

You're over there and I was nowhere near.

You shine, I shine.
My dear, my life
Is washed up like a seashell longing to be dry
So please shine, please shine.

If you shine, I shine.
My dear, my life
Is washed up like a seashell longing to be dry
So please shine, please shine



And it feels good passing time
You tell yourself it's casual
But they have something else in mind
You try to make some reason
A voice calls out from across the room
But she runs away without an answer
She runs away too soon

Somewhere tonight, someone's crying
Somewhere tonight, someone's crying
Somewhere tonight, someone's crying
Somewhere tonight, someone's crying

We all belong to someone
But sometimes they're so far away
You write down words in letters
Not quite sure what they say
And you know that she needs you
And you miss her in your heart
But a certain feeling lingers
That keeps us miles apart

Somewhere tonight, someone's crying
Somewhere tonight, someone's crying
Somewhere tonight, someone's crying
Somewhere tonight, someone's crying



 how long can you stay 
 to haunt my days 

She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado 'bout nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead
And gone
All dead...

All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead
And gone

Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead
And gone
All dead
And gone.



will arise
building up
from the hearts of the moons of mars

be prepared
for the day
when we walk from the darkness
out into light 

dawn
drawing near
comes a time
‘cause the system is breaking down 

be prepared
for the day
when we walk from the darkness
out into light



So don't be serious,
You know there's no cause for alarm.

When you're down, out, left here in doubt,
All the things that are right all go wrong.

Love is a state of mind,
It's keepin' us both alive,
Sometimes it's hard to find,
Love's in this state of mind.

Now wait just a minute, you know I ain't finished,
So don't you go carryin' on,
'cause I'm down, out, left here in doubt,
Well we tried but we can't get along.

Love is a state of mind,
It's keepin' us both alive,
Sometimes it's hard to find,
Love's in this state of mind.

Love is a state of mind,
It's keepin' us both alive,
Sometimes it's hard to find,
Love's in this state of mind.

Love is a state of mind,
It's keepin' us both alive,
Sometimes it's hard to find,
Love's in this state of mind.

Love is a state of mind,
It's keepin' us both alive,
Sometimes it's hard to find,
Love's in this state of - Mind.



Falling rain
To cool my aching face
Lord, she cools me with her fine
And gentle ways

Her eyes so dark and gentle
As they wake
And greet the new day born
Lord, she leads me through her close
And natural dawn

Pleasure, my pleasure is there
Pleasure, my pleasure is there

Tasting my nights
Filling my days
Searching my life
Changing my ways

Pleasure, my pleasure is there
Pleasure, my pleasure is there

My love is warm and willing
Soft, and layed
With days of pure delight
Lord, that leads the evening hour
Into the night

My love is full of pleasure
Falling rain
To cool my aching face
Lord, she cools me with her fine
And gentle ways

Pleasure, my pleasure is there
Pleasure, my pleasure is there

Tasting my nights
Filling my days
Searching my life
Changing my ways



About to close the door
Such a lack of conviction no real connection
What should I settle for?
But you caught my attention you built on the tension
And you left me wanting more
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself
I don't want nobody else

I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through
Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you can't get enough of you

You're so contagious
Running through my veins
You're so contagious 
Hanging onto every word
You're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious
And now I know for sure 
There is no cure

I saw your intentions, I gave you permission 
Go ahead and start the war
I was out of addictions by my own admission 
Oh I've been keeping score
But you made an exception, you taught me a lesson 
Who cares where I've been before
You would never leave me all by myself, all by myself
You don't want nobody else

I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through
Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you can't get enough of you

You're so contagious
Running through my veins
You're so contagious 
Hanging onto every word
You're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious
And now I know for sure 
There is no cure

And I am burning in your fire There is no cure
And I have only one desire There is no cure
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself I can not deny her 
There is no cure
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself 
I don't want nobody else

I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through
Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you

You're so contagious
Running through my veins
You're so contagious 
Hanging onto every word
You're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious
And now I know for sure 
There is no cure

You keep running 
You keep running
You keep running through my veins you're so contagious
You keep running 
You keep running
You keep running through my veins there is no cure
You keep running 
You keep running
You keep running through my veins you're so contagious



and makes you wonder
if you're living at all
what to wish for
if you had one wish only
what to do better
if you had the chance
would i be happy if I went back
and learned how to dance
would it be easy if I took the chance?

this is the real thing
you'll get no second chance
no helping hands
no easy way out
just do the right thing
you'll get no second chance
no helping hands
no easy way out

I should have kept you when I had you
I should have never let you go
I should have loved you like I ought to
but there is something wrong with me
I know there's something
I'm not doing right
but what is right
you tell me

I should have seen the light
but the light was shining
way too bright
and the noise was filling up my nights
without you



That you were lost at sea
I found you drowning on the ocean floor
I woke from my deep sleep to end the misery
I found you lying outside of my door
I tried to wake you up
To shake you up
And found out you were dead

Like a leaf in the wind you left me standing alone
To face the demons in my head

We're making fiction of our lives
Burning pages as we write
We read the lies between the lines
These dead letters won't survive

A dusty record spins
An old song plays again
The needle drags across it's skin
Ink spills through my pen
The paper soaks it in
The music bringing tremors to my hands

I can't just give you up
Just lift you up to chance on a dragon fly's wings
With my love in the wind you left me standing alone
Hoping it brings you back to me

We're making fiction of our lives
Burning pages as we write
We read the lies between the lines
These dead letters won't survive x2

We are not poets
We have not right to make amendments
This story's over
This chapter's closing
I don't know how it ends 
But I really don't like how it begins

We're making fiction of our lives
Burning pages as we write
We read the lies between the lines
These dead letters won't survive x2

We're burning pages
We're burning pages now



to the beginning
cause there's something missing from your eyes.
We lost a lifetime 
when I disappeared,
now I am coming back to you.

I wish I could fly, I know I can save us somehow.
You thought you were safe and sound but you need a hero now.
You gotta believe even with broken wings,
I'll come to your rescue and you can't rescue me.

Summer's the season
but you're cold and freezing,
if there's a reason it's a lie.
When did I loose you,
I need you to pull through,
the weight of the world never felt so alive.

I wish I could fly, I know I can save us somehow.
You thought you were safe and sound but you need a hero now.
You gotta believe even with broken wings.
I wish I could fly, I know I can save us somehow.
You thought you were safe and sound but you need a hero now.
You gotta believe even with broken wings,
I'll come to your rescue and you can't rescue me.
I'll come to your rescue and you can't rescue me.
I'll come to your rescue and you can't rescue me.



Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
I said to my friend, baby, nothing else mattered

He was no more than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken-hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him
All alone on the edge of
Seventeen

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, I went today, maybe I will go again tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, well, the music there
Well, it was hauntingly familiar
Well, I see you doing what I try to do for me
With the words from a poet and a voice from a choir
And a melody
And nothing else mattered

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes colors
But the sea does not change
So with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age-old desire to please
On the edge of seventeen
Ooh

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, then suddenly
There was no one left standing in the hall
Yeah, yeah, in a flood of tears that
No one really ever heard fall at all
Well, I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
A-not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a night bird
Singing "Come away" Come away

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, I hear you in the morning
And I hear you at nightfall
And sometime to be near you 
Is to be unable to hear you, my love
I'm a few years older than you
I'm a few years older than you My love

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh



Upside down while you're straight with me
And I deny that this is your way
Can I, can I still find my way?

Please let this one stay
To help me find your way your way
Please let this one stay
To help me find your way your way
As I'm drowning,
Engulfing the saltwater air
She begs me to find you,
I acknowledge you there

Cure my cancer with your answer



I gotta lotta old friends that are gettin' back in touch
And it's a pretty good feelin, yeah it feels pretty good
I get a lotta double-takes when I'm comin' around the corners
And it's mostly pretty nice, yeah it's mostly pretty alright

'Cause most kids give me credit for being down with it
When it was back in the day, back when things were way different
When the Youth of Today and the early 7 Seconds
Taught me some of life's most valuable lessons

There's gonna come a time when the scene'll seem less sunny
It'll probably get druggy and the kids'll seem too skinny
There's gonna come a time when she's gonna have to go
With whoever's gonna get her the highest

There's gonna come a time when the true scene leaders
Forget where they differ and get big picture
'Cause the kids at the shows, they'll have kids of their own
The sing-along songs will be our scriptures


We gotta stay positive

We gotta stay positive


We gotta stay positive

We gotta stay positive

When the chaperone crowned us the king and the queen
I knew that we'd arrived at a unified scene
And all those little lambs from my dreams
Well, they were there too

'Cause it's one thing to start it with a positive jam
And it's another thing to see it all through
And we couldn't have even done this if it wasn't for you


We gotta stay positive

We gotta stay positive


We gotta stay positive

We gotta stay positive



to break my life away

And then you look into my eyes
until I saw the night's surprise
You saw the night's surprise

But you know that the night
Will bring you back to life
If there's a chance that it might
Take away your life
Then you'll know that the night
Will bring it back
It will bring you back to life

You break my life away
To take my life away

Then I look into your eyes
Until I saw the night's surprise
You saw the night's surprise

But you know that the night
Will bring you back to life
If there's a chance that it might
Take away your life
Then you'll know that the night
Will bring it back
It will bring you back to life



Now we can see in the dark.
Oh no.
x3

Don't worry about the loop,
It's always in control,
Don't worry about the role,
It's never all your fault.
Don't listen to the sound,
It's telling you to move.
Don't listen to the sound,
It's asking you to lose.

It won't be long before you see yourself.
It won't be long before you see the truth.
It won't be long before you see yourself.
It won't be long before you find the new.

Uh oh, we're used to the night,
Now we can see in the dark.
Oh no.
x2

Don't think about the line,
It's never letting go.
Don't think about the line,
It's only what you know.
Don't let it be the end,
It's only just begun.
Don't let it be the end,
It's over when you're done.

It won't be long before you see yourself.
It won't be long before you see the truth.
It won't be long before you see yourself.

Uh oh, we're used to the night,
Now we can see in the dark.
Oh no.



And it's good to see a smiling face
And I just ain't satisfied
'Til the coffee's on and the eggs are fried
Roadworn and weary 
I've gone one too many miles got no one near me and it's going to be a while
And you, you might be far away
Maybe you're low on gas
Looking for a place to stay
I knowof a good little shack that get you thinking straight
With a fresh eyed plate put you back on track
Roadworn and weary 
I've gone one too many miles got no one near me and it's going to be a while
Oh yeah
Roadworn and weary 
I've gone one too many miles got no one near me and it's going to be a while
Roadworn and weary 
I've gone one too many miles got no one near me and it's going to be a while 'til I See your smile
Roadworn and weary,
Gone too many miles



You'll feel like an islander
You'll see ships and they'll be reminders
That you're on an island
I'm on an island

The chances are there's a reason we've been left here
But I'm not disappointed
The chances are there's a reason we've been left
The chances are, the chances are

You can't contact, you can't contact
You can't cope without the contact

As it happens
There's a city in sight
You're getting confused by local lamplight
By local lamplight
Don't buy local lamplights

The chances are there's a reason we've been left here
But I'm not disappointed
The chances are there's a reason we've been left here
The chances are, the chances are

You can't contact, you can't contact
You can't cope without the contact

But what a situation to be in
You and me are keeping in time with my ideas
Keeping in time with my ideas
You can't stop keeping in time

You can't contact, you can't contact
You can't cope without the contact.



Well I've been rolling down the assembly line.
And I've been stuck in flesh for far too long.
And flowing free's been on my mind.
Just like an electric shock. Just like an electric shock. 
Shock, shock, shock, shock, shock.

Become a rainbow one hundred foot tall.
Just flick a switch to turn it on.
Be my metallic and conductive girl.
And we'd be like colours that the heavens spun.
As we sang along. As we sang along. 'Cause you've got me.

Glory! Glory! Glory!
Glory! Glory!

And you're so uplifting. This feeling that you're giving me.
Is pure acceleration. Some kind of chemistry.
Whatever's washing over me, is pure intoxication.
And you're pure acceleration. So let's raise hands and rejoice!
Like electricity, you are my remedy. You are my remedy.

Now that I'm polarised - 240 Volts.
Yes I'm black and white on a cinema screen.
I'm so energised I'm gonna burst. 
But you've gotta charge me first.
You've gotta charge me first. 

Well... Glory electricity the way you shower me. The way you shower me.
Well... Glory electricity the way you power me. The way you power me.

Glory! Glory!
Glory! Glory! Glory!
Yes you've got me!

And you're so uplifting. This feeling that you're giving me.
Is pure acceleration. Some kind of chemistry.
Whatever's washing over me, is pure intoxication.
And you're pure acceleration. So let's raise hands and rejoice!
Like electricity, you are my remedy. You are my remedy.
You are my remedy. You are my remedy.

Some pure interpretation. Some pure detonation.



I've thought it through for a while but it doesn't get any easier 
And three months on in this bad design won't make it feel any easier
Your grave, it's your grave

Dear Hugh Miller
It's four months now from when we started and nothing feels much easier. 
I sit and stare in a cork tiled room and it doesn't get much easier.
Your grave, it's your grave

Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while you don't try
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while don't try

Dear Hugh Miller,

I don't care if I don't have an idea track, it's an idea track, it's an idea
I don't care if I don't have an idea track, it's an idea track, it's an idea
Your grave, it's your grave.



Your pride and joy is a pretty beast
The baddest apples fall from rotten trees
Your little monster is a walking disease
You've got only yourself to blame
'Cause all else failed

And you're hot, hot on my trail
And you know that it's not, not, not my fault
But you know that you've gotta, gotta pin the tail
When all else fails

Cuckoo, cuckoo

Biting the hand that overfeeds
Lord of the Flies ain't no mystery
Mean as murder, so precious and sweet
You've got only yourself to blame
'Cause all else failed

And you're hot, hot on my trail
And you know that it's not, not, not my fault
But you know that you've gotta, gotta pin the tail
When all else fails

Cuckoo, cuckoo

Mama, hide the children
Someone get the baby
Mama, turn all the lights on
Somebody pull the shades

Oooh, and you're hot, hot on my trail
And you know that it's not, not, not my fault
But you know that you've gotta, gotta pin the tail
When all else fails



It's been cold as hell and you just can't tell what a girl might do 
I made a whole lot of promises baby, but none of my dreams came true 
And it's you that paid and I'm so afraid that I'm losing you 

But you belong to me 
You belong to me 
you beleng to me, me, baby, me 

Now your mama said you could do better than me, baby I know that's true 
But you believed me instead. every word I said, and I did too 

But every day's a Iittle bit harder out there no matter what I do 
Well I could carry the world on my shoulders girl long as I got you 

But you belong to me 
You belong to me 
you beleng to me, me, baby, me 

But you belong to me 
You belong to me 
you beleng to me, me, baby, me 

Well my shining armour is rusted and worn 
There's a heart inside here entrusted and sworn to you 
Just tell me baby what I need to do 
I can win you over again if you want me to 

But you belong to me 
You beleng to me, me, baby, me



I have seen every mountain I'm expected to 
Climb, but they're not mine.
I have seen everything in this light before,
Change every light bulb in the house.

I have heard, I have listened, I have
Understood for my own good?
I have seen everything in this light before,
Change every light bulb in the house.



Missing you just runs too deep
Oh I can't breathe thinking of your smile

Every kiss I can't forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God I wish I could make you see
Cuz I know this flame isn't dying
So nothing can stop me from trying

Baby you know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cuz I ain't giving up on love
You know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cuz I ain't giving up on love
No I ain't giving up on us

I just wanna be with you
Cuz living is so hard to do
When all I know is trapped inside your eyes

The future I cannot forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God I wish I could make you see
Cuz I know this flame isn't dying
So nothing can stop me from trying

Baby you know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cuz I ain't giving up on love
You know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cuz I ain't giving up on love
No I ain't giving up on us

Baby can you feel it 
You know I can hear it, hear it
So can you feel me feel you....

You know it's time....

Baby you know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cuz I ain't giving up on love
You know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cuz I ain't giving up on love

You know I ain't giving up on us
You know I ain't giving up on
Oh I ain't giving up on us



There's nothing that can't be done
But how long should it take somebody
Before they can be someone?

'Cause I know there's got to be another level
Somewhere closer to the other side
And I'm feeling like it's now or never
Well, can I break the spell
Of the typical?
The typical
Oh, mmm

Now, I've lived through my share of misfortune
And I've worked in the blazing sun
But how long should it take somebody
Before they can be someone?

'Cause I know there's got to be another level
Somewhere closer to the other side
And I'm feeling like it's now or never
Well, can I break the spell
Of the typical?
The typical
The typical, uh huh
I'm the typical
I'm the typical
Can I break the spell of the typical?

So ah
Because it's dragging me down
Oh, I'd like to know about when
When does it all turn around?

Hey!
I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical

Yeah, I know there's got to be another level
Somewhere closer to the other side
And I'm feeling like it's now or never
Well, can I break the spell
Of the typical?
The typical
The typical, uh huh

Of the typical Break the spell
Of the typical Break the spell
Of the typical
Can I break the spell
Of the typical?
Of the typical, say!
I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical, 'cal
I'm just the typical



I have tried to be a better man
But your world's too hard to see
and your words are killing me

I don't ask that much of you
I just want to hear the truth
But you keep on passing by
Look the other way when I see your eyes

Why can't I be your baby
Why can't I be your man
I ... it's driving me crazy
Why I don't understand

You had all I could give
And I believed you deserved it
Now you're making me realize
Talk about "couldn't make the sacrifice"

See I thought you were serious
But it seems you're scared of us
So now I can't see straight
I guess I'm the one who's been afraid



He said those cars they used to drive were the best
And I know that I'm a simple man
Even my dreams I deserve to have

Annabel had plans of her own
She says "there's no way in hell I'm going home"
'Cause Mamma says she always knows best
Well, God love her, her life is a mess

I won't change my mind
Keep your hand on my thigh tonight
When we get up north
We'll buy us a store
I won't fight in an oil man's war

Bobby bought a brand new suit
From his neighbor bought round toe shoes
Stuffed the money down in his socks
On his way he bought a wrist corsage

But Annie was scared to death
She'd never once in her life laid with a man
And she knew it was his only chance
She bought a white dress second hand

I won't change my mind
Keep your hand on my thigh tonight
When we get up north
We'll buy us a store
I won't fight in an oil man's war

And you can't say it's just a matter of pride
I've been living here since I was a child
Now I'm just a simple man
Even my dreams I deserve to have

I won't change my mind
Keep your hand on my thigh tonight
When we get up north
We'll buy us a store
Live upstairs after the kids are born

And I'm not gonna die
So keep your hand on my thigh tonight
'Cause when we get up north we'll buy us a store
I won't fight in an oil man's war
I won't fight in an oil man's war



The bird fell out and died
Spent its whole life working
And never learned to fly
It ran out of time

A man jumped in the river
To wash away his sin
In his religious fervor
Forgot he couldn't swim
No one saved his skin

Believe you me
I want to believe in you
Believe you me
I want to believe I do

A woman works the corner
Of Hollywood and Vine
No one can afford her
But we stand in line
Cause her love is blind

Believe you me
I want to believe in you
Believe you me
I want to believe I do



Than a prison guard's son
I don't need to be anything other
Than a specialist's son

I don't have to be anyone other
Than the birth of two souls in one
Part of where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm coming from

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind

I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me

I'm surrounded by liars
Everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by imposters
Everywhere I turn

I'm surrounded by identity crisis
Everywhere I turn
Am I the only one who noticed?
I can't be the only one who's learned

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind

I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me

Can I have everyone's attention please?
If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave
I came from the mountain
The crust of creation
My whole situation made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms

Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me
I don't want to be



Had groupies in your bed 

Had the studio booked for recordings 
And the video in your head 

Wow - you're so damn incredible 
Wow - each move is a strike 
Wow - you're so irresistible 
Go - get a life! 

This is your show 
You're playing all by yourself 
All on your own - 
No one is listening
Except for your neighbours
And they really hate 
The music you play 
Cause you're part of the band 
That never existed! 

Sent the cd's to all the agents 
But there was nothing to hear 
Booked a limo for the red carpet 
But the doorman said - "no"! 

This is your show 
You're playing all by yourself 
All on your own - 
No one is listening 
Except for your neighbours 
And they really hate 
The music you play 
Cause you're part of the band 
That never existed! 

Wow - you're dreaming your life away 
Wow - you're missing the glow
Wow - you're not irresistible 
Go - go get a life! 

This is your show 
You're playing all by yourself 
All on your own - 
No one is listening! 
Except for your neighbours
And they really hate 
The music you play 
Cause you're part of the band 
That never existed! 

The band that never existed!



I was trying to be mean and cruel and unkind
Don't take it too hard
There's another man inside me wants to break us apart

You were chic off the peg, bang up to the minute
I had to put my big foot in it
Don't shout it all about
There's another man inside me and he wants to get out

Mascara tears, bitter and black
A spent bullet drilled a hole in my back
Salt for the memory, black for the years
Black as forever, mascara tears

There's hell and hoodoo in your kitchen
You've got to scratch the place you're itching
How long will it take
There's another girl inside you and she never got a break

Mascara tears, bitter and black
A spent bullet drilled a hole in my back
Salt for the memory, black for the years
Black as forever, mascara tears

You just moan and weep and moan and weep
Dirty rivers running down your face
Tears all down your party face

Mascara tears, bitter and black
A spent bullet drilled a hole in my back
Salt for the memory, black for the years
Black as forever, mascara tears



I been thinking for some time how to get things where I want
don't know if you got it but at least you tried
you gave me all the solutions that I couldn't find
it made a difference when you were behind
I guess you know that I appreciate what you've done
I used to cry myself to sleep for ten years
but now I’m dry I guess I’m healed



Have made their way here instead, before the riot
As the days ahead become behind
Replace the tape as we rewind, before the riot

Tell me all your secrets
Say it slowly and clear so you don't have to speak twice

And if there's things that I'm afraid to know
I should have learned them years ago, before the riot

I don't believe we're hopeless as we fear
Or as good as we appear, before the riot
I could be strong inside your sleeping eyes
Unafraid of truth, unafraid of lies, before the riot

Think of what we're missing
Well take that thought and put it out of your head

And if we can stop a restless night
Won't give up without a fight, before the riot

I can feel the time is coming, sure it's coming soon
Do what we do, hiding out from view
Sure it's coming, say the worst should happen
Would we plan for that, even if we could?
And if we can stop a restless night
Won't give up without a fight, before the riot
Here it comes, before the riot



I taste your skin
I need to know
I need to feel you from within
As your blood burns through my skin
I feel complete
I breathe you in
It's where you end and I begin
If only I could stay here...forever
So much to tell you
And So much to give you
So much to confide
Now that I'm inside you

We are flesh
We are one
So why do I feel so much guilt for what I've done?
As your blood burns through my skin
I feel release
I breathe you in
It's where you end and I begin
If I could only stay here...forever
So much to tell you
So much to give you
So much to confide
Now that I'm inside you



waiting for your call
it's simple but I can't explain this
I'm sinking down
I feel like I could die
I'm fallin' off I don't know why

I still believe it when you say it's another perfect day, another perfect day
I still believe it when you say it's another perfect day, another perfect day

So I might try to leave it all behind
I know tomorrows not so bright now
I'll say goodbye
'cause nothing good can last
you wear and fade your no where fast
but today
I don't know how
to keep it all inside
but i guess I'll let it slide

I still believe it when you say it's another perfect day, another perfect day
I still believe it when you say it's another perfect day, another perfect day

today I don't know why
I thought that it was real
but I guess it's no big deal

I still believe it when you say it's another perfect day, another perfect day
I still believe it when you say it's another perfect day, another perfect day

I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how to let it slide...



I shoulda seen the signs
Didn't really think that she needs me

The girls were kinda flirting with the setting sun
We all kinda fumbled through the Jitterbug
We were all powered up on some new upper drug

Everyone was funny and everyone was pretty
And everyone was coming towards the center of the city
The dance floor was crowded, the bathrooms were worse
We kissed in your car and we drank from your purse

I had my mouth on her nose
When the chaperone said that we were dancing too close

We had some massive nights
Every song was right
All that wine was tight
And your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool

And there weren't any fights
There's usually one or two 
Some guys they get a little bit uptight
Some girls they got something to prove 

We had some massive highs
We had some crushing lows
We had some lusty little crushes
We had those all ages hardcore matinee shows

I was down on my knees
When the chaperone said that it was time for me to leave

We had some massive nights
And every song was right
All that wine was tight
Your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool

And there weren't any fights
There's usually one or two 
Some guys they get a little bit uptight
Some girls they got something to prove 

We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights

We had some massive nights
And every song was right
All that wine was tight
Your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool

She had the gun in her mouth
And she was shooting up at her dreams
When the chaperone said that we'd been crowned
The king and the queen



It's in our eyes like shallow graves
But we are one with the larvae and dirt
We don't discriminate at all for what it's worth

So live young, die fast, no one will last
So sit back and relax, enjoy the crash
You fade into black and you're gone
Live young, die fast

An uneasy life, an untimely death
This doesn't work at all for me, so save your breath
You took your time, stashed it away
Deep down inside of a cardboard box marked "rainy day"

So live young, die fast, no one will last
So sit back and relax, enjoy the crash
It fades into black, then it's gone
Live young, die fast

I feel a miracle in every breath that I breathe
Won't let this miracle end in tragedy
I sense a miracle in all that I see
Won't let this miracle slip away from me

So live young, die fast, no one will last
So sit back and relax, enjoy the crash
It fades into black, then it's gone
Live young, die fast



'Cause I will never be
Any of the things
That you have planned for me

Mother hold your tears
'Cause I am happy now
My free and independent spirit
Curses me somehow, but I say

You're not the only one
Who lives and breathes this pain
Don't be the holy one
'Cause if he comes again
You're not the only one
And God don't hold a grudge

Father hold your fist
'Cause I will never be
An image of yourself
No perfect family
Father it's too late
To make a man of me
I love against the gods
But I don't scare too easily and I say

You're not the only one
Who lives and breathes this pain
Don't be the holy one
'Cause if he comes again
You're not the only one

State your number and your cause
Your black skin or your menopause
Your cancer your identity
You're not so different to me

You're not the only one
State your number and your cause
Don't be the holy one
Your black skin or your menopause
You're not the only one
Your cancer your identity
Don't be the holy one
You're not so different to me



I thought I had it made
In the worst way

We made our share of mistakes
Like a hurricane
Oh bringing me on display
For the world to see, yeah

But would you believe
I'm on top
You were the best
I did know I didn't have
And now that I'm here on top
Oh this chance and moment are all I have

I'd say I'm the luckiest one you know
So why did you even go
In the first place
I'd give whatever it takes
Like a hurricane
Oh takin' me on parade
For the world to see, yeah

But would you believe
I'm on top
You were the best
I did know I didn't have
And now that I'm here on top
Oh this chance and moment are all I have

On top, on top

When the fear of heights sets in this time
Looking down like I can just go fly

Hurricane
Oh takin me
On display
For the world to see, yeah

But would you believe
I'm on top
You were the best
I did know I didn't have
See I can only give it to you
When you were on top
Oh this chance and moment are all I have

On top!
On top!
On top!
On top!

She sings in celebration with her piper for me
She's leading the man who's beating the drum
Love is all around her on the road to the sun
  
Round, round, moving me round
Round, round the air
  
She's lost in conversation with the birds of the air
She's trading information in a world without fear
She's fixing up a potion made of laughter and love
And I will follow the enchanter on the road to the sun
  
Round, round, moving me round
Round, round, round
  
Oh that the stars will light my way
Oh as my tides dance the ebb and sway
She's studying the planets and she's searching for signs
Her eyes promise mystery and her treasure to find
She's mixing my emotions it's so easily done
In a league with the enchanter on the road to the sun
  
Oh that the stars will light my way
Oh as my tides dance the ebb and sway
It's so very easily done
  
She moves through the mountains and down to the sea
She sings in celebration with her piper for free
She's leading the man who's beating the drum
And love is all around her on the road to the sun



And I'm somebody else
It could take years to find you
It could take years to find myself
And I don't need to hear your answer
I just need you to see
That I think it's time to break down
These walls that we throw up

Am I still breathing
Have I lost that feeling
Am I made of glass 'cause
You see right through me
I don't know who I am
And you're the only one who sees that
I can't ask these questions
That cannot be answered today

And even if everything goes wrong
And we start to fall apart
I will understand where you are
I will understand this by myself
And I don't need to hear your answer
I just need you to feel
Like their are no boundaries at all

Am I still breathing
Have I lost that feeling
Am I made of glass 'cause
You see right through me
I don't know who I am
And you're the only one who sees that
I can't ask these questions
That cannot be answered today

I don't mind today
Whoa, today, I don't matter today, oh..

And how far have we come
Too far to throw away the past
Will you be there waiting for me?
If I have to ask what we are..
If I ask today it just won't last
So I'll be here waiting for you

Will we ever feel this good again
Will we ever feel this real again, again
Will you ever be mine again
Will we ever feel this real again

Not today, today
I don't mind today
Whoa, today
I don't matter today



On a boat that's bound for hope - But left you in the queue
With your shouting, waving, taunting, flaunting friends as crew
Telling you that every lie you ever heard was true
Have you stood upon that deck - Have you ever had it blue.

Have you ever woke to find the morning didn't come
Undelivered with the papers - stolen by someone
Found the milkman bound and gagged and shackles ' round the sun
And the holder of the keys turns out to be the one
The girl you had your heart set on - Have you ever had it blue.

Have you ever watched the day, passing by your door
Powerless to change its course, your feet fixed to the floor
When all the people you thought you knew are changing more and more
Even the girl you thought would see, seems only to ignore
The only love worth fighting for - Have you ever had it blue



That no one will watch over you 
And someone shouldn't really tell me 
What I want to know
I know oh ho
I know that matters don't matter as much 
As you think they do

Cause you will only be yourself
And you can never be yourself
And you will only be yourself
When you understand what you know

How long will we go on 
With the modern way of letting go
Tell me how long will we go on 
With the modern way of letting you go

If I know what I know 
Losing isn't learning to be lost 
It's learning to know when you're lost
And I know what I know 
I wanna make the most of what it seems like

You will only be yourself
And you can never be yourself
And you will only be yourself
When you understand what you know

How long will we go on 
With the modern way of letting you go
Tell me how long will we go on 
With the modern way of letting you go



I can't focus - I can't speak,
It's like i'm underwater,
I'm going deep - I need you around me.

Oxygen - Every moment,
Oxygen - Everyday,
I can't live without it - Don't take it away,
I need to breath you in - Like oxygen.

Losin' cohesion - I'm losin' my mind,
I'm tryin' to resist it - To stay out of the light,
It's like I'm drownin' - In the deepest sea,
Well I need you around me.

Oxygen - Every moment,
Oxygen - Everyday,
I can't live without it, no - Don't take it away,
I need to breath you in - Like oxygen.

My pulse racin' - My heads in a spin,
I need to see you darlin' - 'cause you're my oxygen.

Oxygen every moment - Oxygen everyday,
I can't live without it, no - Don't take it away,
I need to breath you in - Over and over again,
Like oxygen.

Every moment - Everyday,
Yeah, I need you around me,
Oxygen every moment - Oxygen everyday,
Just like oxygen.



And she's weak emotionally
But she kissed me
And she put it there
She's got a chip on her shoulderblade
And her attitude makes me afraid
But she kissed me
And she put it there

She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

When she bets
She'd never hedge
She likes walking on the razor's edge
But she kissed me
And she put it there
She likes rap and metal really loud
And she makes her other home girls proud
But she kissed me
And she put it there

She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

She's as simple as a girl can be
Yet she has a cool complexity
But she kissed me
And she put it there
When she met me I was still a boy
Now I'm an older woman's toy
Because she kissed me
And she put it there



I used to be a nerd
Grew up in the suburbs
Nothing there ever went wrong
I made it up in this song
I talk about the hood
I say stuff like "It's all good"
Tell people I'm down 
With all the cool kids downtown
When I've never even been there

How many people wanna kick some ass? I do, I do
And how many people sick of holding it back? I am Well, I am, too
So don't lay a fuckin' finger on her
She's mine and I still want her
If you put your hands upon her
You're a goner
Goner
And how many people sick of holding it back? I am, I am
And how many people wanna kick some ass? I would if I could
But I'm really just a sensitive artist
Perpetrated like I am the hardest

So spin your cap around to the back
You think you rhyme, but you can't rap
Loosen that strap a little more
'Til your axe hits the floor
Flip off your fans, and make them cheer
Try to look sincere
Anger's today's fashion
So sing another song about bashing 
Someone's head in

How many people wanna kick some ass? I do, I do
And how many people sick of holding it back? I am Well, I am, too
So, don't lay a fuckin' finger on her
She's mine and I still want her
If you put your hands upon her
You're a goner
Goner
And how many people sick of holding it back? I am, I am
How many people wanna kick some ass? I would if I could
But I'm really just a sensitive artist
Perpetrated like I am the hardest
Acting like I'm not the smartest
I'm really just a sensitive artist

Aww, yeah


So don't lay a fuckin' finger on her
She's mine and I still want her
If you put your hands upon her
You're a goner
Goner

And how many people sick of holding it back? I am, I am
And how many people wanna kick some ass?

I said, how many people wanna kick some ass?
How many people wanna kick some ass?
Whatcha gonna do when you're sick of holding it back?
I think I'll kick some ass

How many people wanna kick some ass? I would if I could
But I'm really just a sensitive artist
Perpetrated like I am the hardest
Acting like I'm not the smartest
But I'm really just a sensitive artist

Honest



That you feel
The fear exists
On a larger scale
Spin the world
And stop it still
Anywhere you land
Anyone you kill
You are gonna find that


Everybody bleeds the same
After all
Everybody feels the same
Pain
And the preachers preach
And they write it all down
Like they know
But the secret is
Everybody bleeds the same

I am you and you are me
We're the same mistake
Packaged differently
Who is your god
When you pray
If you break it down
To the DNA
You are gonna find that


While soldiers
Pull the covers
Over there dead
Roll over to your lover
Say put your arms around me
Surround me in the darkness
And I'll pray to every god
My soul to keep
Cause I'm never ever
Gonna get to sleep
Help me dream
I wanna dream forever




I got news from my brother, hey, hey, hey
When they grind you down into the ground
And there's really no one to be found

I got news from my brother yesterday
He said, he had seen you, seen you with her
When you grind me down into the ground
I won't ask for help, you're not around

No one knows where the summer goes
You wait all year when the summer comes
The summer comes, summer comes

No one knows where the summer goes
Wait all year when the summer comes
Oh, the summer come, summer come

I got news from my brother just today
He said, he's really sorry, he made a mistake
When it grinds you down into the ground
And you feel like sinking in the ground

I got news, I got news
I got news, I got news



In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake", she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes
Well-versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind 
Anytime
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man in China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind 
Anytime

Drop of a hat
She's as willing
As playful as a pussycat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
Will absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind 
Anytime
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try?



clouds are hanging over me
obscurity prevails
wearing the face
of doubts, hopes and promises
I wish that you would stay

don't blunt the edge
I breathe through my senses
the flesh and the divine
delicate moves
surrender into strangeness
and I can't make out the signs

fall through the air
groundbound and giving away

your secret is safe 
unless it would break in two
heaven's still unbound
cling to my wings,
the dreams and the things we knew
now would you want it to? 

fall through the air
groundbound and gliding
giving away



useful, or useless
because I'm lying here
wide to receive
almost anything
you'd care to give
and I don't
get along with myself
and I'm not too keen
on anyone else
Turn on, plug in
then just walk away
unlock, process
then just go
and I've never felt quite so alone
as I do right now



Once in a while you get a room with a view
I'm dying for you baby and your heaven's touch
Can't do without you 'cause you're much too much

You think you're just turning a page
I gotta tell ya that you're shakin' my cage

Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake, shakin', shakin' my cage
Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake, shakin', shakin' my cage

Everybody feels like they got something to do
Drive around the corner into some place new
Oh, flows like a river 'cause it can't be slowed
No room for heartaches it get a real fast load

You think you're just turning a page
I gotta tell ya that you're shakin' my cage

Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake, shakin', shakin' my cage
Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake, shakin', shakin' my cage

I'm dying for you baby and your heaven's touch
My friends all tell me that you are much too much
Oh, they're all hoping, they can feel the crunch
'Cause they all know I got a real crush

You think you're just turning the page
I gotta tell ya that you're shakin' my cage

Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake, shakin', shakin' my cage
Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake, shakin', shakin' my cage

Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake, shakin', shakin' my cage
Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake, shakin', shakin' my cage



He might pass by in the hour of need
There's a lot of souls
Ain't drinking from no well locked in a factory

Hey, look there goes
Hey, look there goes
If you're after getting the honey
Then you don't go killing all the bees

Lorde, there goes Martin Luther King
Notice how the door closes when the chimes of freedom ring
I hear what you're saying, I hear what he's saying
Is what was true now no longer so

Hey, I hear what you're saying
Hey, I hear what he's saying
If you're after getting the honey
Then you don't go killing all the bees

What the people are saying
And we know every road - go, go
What the people are saying
There ain't no berries on the trees

Let the summertime sun
Fall on the apple, fall on the apple

Lord, there goes a Buick 49
Black sheep of the angels riding, riding down the line
We think there is a soul, we don't know
That soul is hard to find

Hey, down along the road
Hey, down along the road
If you're after getting the honey
Then you don't go killing all the bees

Hey, it's what the people are saying, it's what the people are saying
Hey, there ain't no berries on the trees
Hey, that's what the people are saying
No berries on the trees

You're checking out the honey, baby
You had to go killin' all the bees



From all the people I know
I find it so hard
To turn my back
But I must put my foot down
Stick to my own guns

So, my dear friend
Be there for me
I'll be there for you
Be there for we

Must get what I need
I've got no money
Must get what I need
I've got no money
Must get what I need
I've got no money
And just to get it
I would walk right over you

Must get what I need
I've got no money
Must get what I need
I've got no money
Must get what I need
I've got no money
And just to get it
I would walk right over you

Walking away
I heard a rumour spoken
Said I'm shaken
Up from a dream
But I say, no, it's not true
My head is clearer

The sun will go down
Again so soon
There's no time to lose
Again I'll say

Must get what I need
I've got no money
Must get what I need
I've got no money
Must get what I need
I've got no money
And just to get it
I would walk right over you

Must get what I need
I've got no money
Must get what I need
I've got no money
Must get what I need
I've got no money
And just to get it
I would walk right over you







'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, mm-mm
Singin', don't worry, baby, don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright

Rise up this mornin', smile with the risin' sun
Three little birds pitched by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Sayin', this is my message to you

Oh, don't worry, don't you worry about a thing, oh no no no
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, woh-oh
Singin', don't worry about a thing, I won't have to worry
Every little thing is gonna be alright

Rise up this mornin', smile with the risin' sun
Three little birds pitched by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Sayin', this is my message to you

Singin', don't worry, don't you worry about a thing, mm-mm
Every little thing is gonna be alright, don't worry
Sayin', don't worry about a thing, I won't have to worry
Every little thing is gonna be alright, I tell myself that

Don't worry about a thing, I won't have to worry
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, baby, don't worry
Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, every day, every night

Don't worry about a thing, oh-oh
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, don't worry



Oh, we say what we say, and the poison is breaking our skin
Blame, what's to blame? It's an argument no one can win
'Cause at best we don't know, and it's wearing us thin

And we stare at the sun, but we never see anything there
Just a glare has become all that we'll ever see there
And we stare at the sun, but we never see anything there
All of nothing's become all that we'll ever see there

Cards, we are cards in a wheel spun around on the truth
Maybe we don't need to know any more than we have to

And we stare at the sun, but we never see anything there
Just a glare has become all that we'll ever see there
And we stare at the sun, but we never see anything there
All of nothing's become all that we'll ever see there

The sky is always wondering, what are these arguments about?
You'd think we would notice our eyes are burning out
We should have learned by now

And we stare at the sun but we never see anything there
Just a glare has become all that we'll ever see there
And we stare at the sun but we never see anything there
All of nothing's become all that we'll ever see there
It's all that we'll ever see there

And we stare at the sun...



To pay the rent 
But we're gonna make it 
We may have to eat beans everyday 
But we're gonna make it 
And if a job is hard to find 
And we have to stand 
In the welfare line 
I've got your love 
And I know you got mine 
And we're gonna make it 
We may not have a home 
To call our own 
But we're gonna make it 
I know we will 
We may have to fight hardships alone 
We're gonna make it, I know we will 
'Cause togetherness 
Brings peace of mind 
We can't stay down all of the time 
I've got your love 
And you know you've got mine 
And we're gonna make it 
I know we will 
The car may be old 
Our two rooms cold 
But we're gonna make it 
And though we can't spare 
A roach a crumb 
But we're gonna make it 
I know we will 
And if I have to carry around a sign 
That says, "Help the deaf 
The dumb and the blind" 
I've got your love 
You know you've got mine 
We're gonna make it 
I know we will 
We may not have a home 
Just to call our own 
But we're gonna make it 
I know we will 
We may have to fight hardships alone 
But we're gonna make it 
I know we will 
'Cause togetherness 
Brings peace of mind 
We can't stay down all of the time 
I've got your love 
You know you got mine 
We're gonna make it 
I know we will 
We're gonna make it 
We're gonna make it, baby 
I know we're gonna make it, baby



Maybe you should try and take better care of yourself"
And I tried to explain that it's hard to complain when
The worst part of you is the best part of me
And you listen to me
Yeah, you listen to me
I'm just trying to relax my imagination
I'm just trying to correct the situation
And I know that you know that I haven't been trying so hard
My concentration level seems to throw itself out through the window
And now it's starting to rain, and I'm losing my train
Of thought, though it's hard to remember all that I forgot
It'd be fine if it were sometimes, but it happens a lot
I'm just trying to avoid a confrontation
I'm just trying to correct the situation
I swear, I was going to stop anyway due to boredom
It was not that you were just encouraging me not to do that anymore
And I don't want to have to argue with you
Because there's so many things that I'd rather do
Than to argue with you
And to argue with you
Just to argue with you
I'm just trying to ignore what you've just mentioned
I'm just trying to correct the situation



I'll always be your son
But all is not forgiven
Well I'm on my knees pleading
Just 'cause I'm grown you think I don't need
Much more than what you've ever given me

So when we gonna get together
Seems there's no time for me
You act like you got forever
You've got time, but you ain't got time for me

You said you've got time
But you ain't got time for me

Now that you've gone and tossed
The bottle away now will ya
Start a new life with the new wife
Well she'll never be my mother
I suppose that you know you oughta
Remember the ones you left behind

You're just letting it slip away now
You act like things are fine
I know you think you've been born again
But this time
You're leaving your son behind

This time
This time
This time



Exact revenge in a grotesque way
Build a Taj Mahal on vacation time
The kiddies frag the sap before the ink is dry
It's as good as any joke I know
Write a book of leaves shuffled by the wind
Two unbound lives, orderless and grim
Set up to ensure failing miserably
Sublimate a world into poetry
The make sure your last intention's known
You were dead by forty-two
There'd be no rigid form for you
Jammed into a plot where you never would fit
A tiny manuscript with a hole cut in it
As you drifted off to sleep, my mother set bedtime for me
Terrycloth robe with a hand-me-down fit
Playing in the bath with a warship in it, yeah



And you've got them twisting bones
And a red hot poker burning in your ear
You think you've had it
But you ain't nowhere near
You think you've had it
But you're nowhere near

Ah black mambo gonna knock you down to the ground
Black mambo little chicken better run

Don't let the children catch you
Don't let the children catch you

Gonna lock you down with liquor and love
Black mambo, little chicken better run, run, run
Don't let them catch you out here on the street
Cause you've got no soul
Black mambo, little chicken better run, run, run

Don't let the children catch you
Don't let the children catch you

I lock you down with liquor and love
I lock you down with liquor and love
Ah black mambo with a funeral horn
You better run, you better run, you better run...
Black mambo coming for you

Ah black mambo comes knocking with a funeral horn
Black mambo little chicken better run, run, run

Don't let the children catch you
Don't let the children catch you



But dies for the peace 
In the clouds he waits for an answer 
But there's no release

It's strange here without you 
And it's so hard to see 
So brother up in heaven 
Please wait up for me
Brother up in heaven 
Please wait up for me

I still see his shadow 
His laugh lingers on 
When I dream, we're all back together 
When I wake, he's gone 

It's strange here without you 
This was not ment to be 
So brother up in heaven 
Please wait up for me

And though we try to change the world 
A flower when it's cut will surely die 
So why do men with so much hate 
Destroy what they cannot create 
While we all stand by

We look back in anger 
But you helped us to see 
So brother up in heaven 
Please wait up for me

Oh, brother up in heaven 
Please wait up for me



You got me looking 
You got me looking
I lost my fear because fear is never living
You got me looking

All these promises were made
Hey I'm living full stride

All these promises were made 

Hey I'm living full stride

I know, I no longer need you.
Because when I was down and out, you heard me scream and shout,
Please show, you hear others who need you.
Won't you take them by the hand,
Come on and lead them from this barren land,

Won't you save a soul in every town,
Please save a soul in every town

From the strength of belief,
we'll put an end to all our grieves,
But first, let it not be forgotten
You can help the feeble up,
But don't ever let them dry,
We must stay around to support them.
Won't you take them by the hand,
Come on and lead them from this barren land,
Won't you save a soul in every town,
Save a soul in every ton.

Save a soul who is hungry and starts to cry,
And the mother who fears that her well runs dry,
With your help we can give them a better life,
Free from trouble and strife.

Lord you saved me from myself, won't you save somebody else,
I know, I no longer need you.
Won't you take them by the hand,
Come on and lead them from this barren land,

Won't you save a soul in every town
Please save a soul in every town.



They have no uncertainty
I'm just a passing emotion
Just hoping they take notice
And you are an opportunity
Without an opportunity
Another passing emotion
And hope that someone will take notice

And did I hear you sing
That we exist without existing
Or did I hear you sing
That we'll land where we begin

I understand it, but I don't show it
So I won't think it, and maybe we'll be there
Maybe we will be there

I understand it, but I don't show it
So I won't think it, and maybe we'll be there
Maybe one day we will be there

Oh, oh-oh-oh...

I thought I heard you say
That I must be dissappearing
But I'm sure I heard you sing
We won't begin

I understand it, but I don't show it
So I won't think it, and maybe we'll be there
Maybe we will be there

I understand it, but I don't show it
So I won't think it, and maybe we'll be there
Maybe one day we will be there

Oh, oh-oh-oh...

You have no sense in emptiness
Will you try a little harder
You have no sense in emptiness
Will you try, try, try a little harder



This high water tied underneath the flood
In deserts of dust if I must i will stand
These are my promises

I hope you're winning the war
To make everything like it was before
All that we were we can still be again

I swear

I'm afraid you're gone

I don't want you
I don't want you to go
I've got the sun in my eyes
I didn't see you passing me by
I just wanted you
I just wanted you to know

Inside of me forever you'll go

Now I just want to go home
Carried by all that was ever known
Held in these hands if I must I will stand

Given these promises

Now I've been running too long
These feet are too tired to carry on
Weighing us down if you're gone I will drown

I'm afraid you're gone

I don't want you
I don't want you to go
I've got the sun in my eyes
I didn't see you passing me by
I just wanted you
I just wanted you to know

If forever exists
Inside me it where you belong
If forever exists

I've got the sun in my eyes
I didn't see you passing me by
Now I've been running too long
To carry on
I don't want you
I don't want you to go
I've got the sun in my eyes
I'm afraid you're gone
If forever exists
Inside me is where you belong

If forever exists...



Devil's grip, it won't let me breathe 
Fool's gold is love over money
This time I've lost my control   

Love of God, it won't let me near you 
Devil's grip, is all over me 
Perfect is less than perfection
This time I don't want to see what's left of me   

Love of God, you won't disappoint me 
Fail to feel I don't want to feel 
Leave me, I'm broken and hungry 
This time I don't want to feel what's left to feel   

Here and forever I have found
Life with no answers you have found
Here in the anti I have gone
Skin black from bruising



You’re better than killing a fight
You’re maybe better than the gift of sight
You’re better, you’re better
You’re better than my favourite shoes
You’re better than beating the blues
You’re better than a new tattoo
You’re better, you’re better
You’re better than satellite
Staying up all night
In a thousand ways

More danger than a stranger’s kiss
How in the world did I deserve all this?
So come on so come on
So come on so come on
So come on so come on
So come on

You’re the bomb, you’re the one, the wow
You’re better, you’re better
The dog’s balls and the cat’s meow
You’re better, you’re better
Ain’t ever gonna be that guy hanging round
Looking for somebody to kiss
Little one, well it don’t come better than this

You’re better than making the rent
You’re better than a night in a tent
You’re even better than 40 percent
You’re better, you’re better
You’re better than seeing the world
You’re better than Steve Earle
You’re even better than girls
You’re better, you’re better
You’re better than sleeping late
Or being straight
In a thousand ways

More exciting than a night on the town
What would I do without you around?
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah

You’re the bomb, you’re the one, the wow
You’re better, you’re better
The dog’s balls and the cat’s meow
You’re better, you’re better
Ain’t ever gonna be that guy hanging round
Looking for somebody to kiss
Little one, well it don’t come better than this

Had every drug in town, it told me I was down
See through a cloudy haze, hope I come around
Now that I know ya
And I sure am glad that I know ya
I need you, you need me
So who needs drugs?

You’re better than a ton in the car
You’re better than a screaming guitar
You’re the best and you know you are
You’re better, you’re better
You’re better than satellite
Staying up all night
In a thousand ways

And you do it like nobody can
And I’m the world’s most fortunate man
Oh no oh yeah
Oh no oh yeah
Oh no oh yeah
Whatever

You’re the bomb, you’re the one, the wow
You’re better, you’re better
The dog’s balls and the cat’s meow
You’re better, you’re better
Ain’t ever gonna be that guy hanging round
Looking for somebody to kiss
Little one, well it don’t come better than this
Little one, well it don’t come better than this



If you need it
Sacrifice now
If you need it
Moving onward
Getting harder
Find a pattern
Does it matter?

Speak in signals
Secret greeting
Spoken clearly
Hidden meaning
No one noticed
Getting faster
It's forgotten
It's forever

You believe what you say
Does it matter anyway?
Matter at all?
Matter at all?
Matter at all?
Matter at all?
Matter at all? all, all, all



Another sleepless night dismissed
It might take a day to get back and figure out what I missed
How'd I get back here at this?
My knuckles white clenched into fists
I might need a day to get back and figure out what I missed

I've been losing sleep for days trying to claim
What little stake I have and why my heart betrays
I'd bail out if it made me free, I'd run but I can barely breathe

How'd I get back here at this? Another cheap attempt at bliss
It might take more than this bottle
To forget about what I missed
How'd I get back here at this? I'm feeling torn just to exist
I guess I need more time to process
The feelings I once dismissed

I've been losing you for days playing this game
I've been using up again my ways to kill this pain
My reasons propped up on this candy cane
It cures my stroke of bad luck and my heart attack of shame
I'd bail out if it made me free, I'd bail out if it made you see
I'd run but I can barely breathe

I'd rather run away, crawl away
Than have you perceive my slow decay
I can barely breathe and these cuts heal but they won't bleed
We could have a knock-down-drag-out
Or face what's been the case...
But it could end up in disgrace

What if we tried to relocate it?
Would it even change a single thing?



I was off on a road trip
A couple hundred bucks and a case of beer
Outside Panama City limits is where it all begins

2:00 A.M., I saw hazard lights
Appeared to be a dame distressed in the night
She was 5'6" and, damn, she was built
I slammed on the brakes and got sideways and told her to get in
She said, "Where you headed, to the city?"
I said, "Yeah! I'm gonna have some fun"
She tossed her hair back in confidence
And said, "Mind if I come?"

Two days later, we ain't left the room
Did all in there that we could think to do
I could see she was restless, so we hit the town
Ended up at a place where the windows read:
"Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here"
"Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here"

Into the back she went and disappeared
Reappeared an hour late cheesing ear to ear
I thought, "Hell, I need to try and get back there"
When she unzipped her pants and said, "Looky here
I got a brand-new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
I got a brand-new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
The blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
And the red is for color we're 'bout to paint this town
Ooh, I got a new tattoo"

One week passed; woke up a day late for work
I found my goodtime gone and she took my shirt
Drove by all the places that we had been
There was one where the windows read:
"Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here"
"Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here"

Into the back I went and disappeared
Reappeared an hour later cheesing ear to ear
And I cannot forget
That smile when she said,
"I got a brand-new tattoo"



We'd like another round of drinks bartender
And would you please take all the empties away
My new found friend and I will soon be leaving
And we don't have far to go... even though it's all the way

It must be gettin' late I'm seein' double
And I've spent the last five dollars of my pay
Gettin' home from here won't be no trouble
Cause we don't have far to go.. even though it's all the way

Well I can feel you touch my hand beneath the table
It tells me things that words would never say
I would like to carry on this thing we started
And the want to in your eyes says you might stay
The mornin' light won't find you broken hearted
And we don't have far to go... even though it's all the way

Now we've come from bein' lost and lonely strangers
To a whole new understanding of what each other needs
Well we're almost there it's just around the corner
And the night has almost faded into today
Now I promise I will love you more tomorrow
And we don't have far to go... even though it's all the way
No we don't have far to go... even though it's all the way



I have been trapped by the shine and the light
You got the heart of a queen and your mind
Gives me the kicks that I need to survive

As I've been trying to say it to you
You have seen me right through
You've go the heat
You're surreal
I can feel
You're a goddess
You're taking me down

Give it to me Ellie, Ellie it's a saturday night
You are turning into mine I know
Now I know
Sing it to me Ellie, Ellie see the saturday lights
You know that you're mine tonight I know
Now 'cause you got the soul of the sun

I caught the soul of the sun in your eyes
I was so cold now I'm warm and alive
If it's a dream I will make it come real
I might be dumb, but I know how I feel

As I've been trying to say it to you
You have seen me right through
You've got the heat
You're surreal
I can feel
You're a goddess
You're taking me down

Give it to me Ellie, Ellie it's a saturday night
You are turning into mine I know
Now I know
Sing it to me Ellie, Ellie see the saturday lights
You know that you're mine tonight I know
Now 'cause you got the soul of the sun

What if it's over now?
What if it's over now?
'Cause if it's over now
I'm over now

Give it to me Ellie, Ellie it's a saturday night
You are turning into mine I know
Now I know
Sing it to me Ellie, Ellie see the saturday lights
You know that you're mine tonight I know
Now 'cause you got the soul of the sun

Yeah you got the soul of the sun
Yeah you got the soul of the sun
Yeah you got the soul of the sun
Yeah you got the soul of the sun

/lyrics>



When she says that i'm the one.
Yes I know
What that means
To her.

Her friends all married young
And then fell out of love.
Yes I know
What that means
To her.

I am scared every day
When two hearts are at stake.
It's the strong vs the weak
With a chance they both might break.

Oh but on her stereo
There's a song we claim to know.
It goes Love can change your minds
In good time.

She works a 9 to 5
Returns home with a sigh.
Is this life, really mine
Is this life?

She looks to the west coast
As a place to call her home.
She moved twice, in a year

She moved twice.

I am scared every day
When two hearts are at stake.
It's the strong vs the weak
With a chance they both might break.

Oh but on her stereo
There's a song we claim to know.
It goes Love can change your minds
In good time.

New years eve, she told me..

I am scared every day
When two hearts are at stake.
It's the strong vs the weak
With a chance they both might break.

Oh but on her stereo
There's a song we claim to know.
It goes Love can change your minds
Only if we give it time.

I'll be tryin'
She'll be callin'
In good time.



I'm reminded, i'm reminded.
Every morning when I see the sunrise
I'm reminded, i'm reminded.

Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh o o ohhhh.
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh o o ohhhh.

We can be found, we can be found
It's never too late
To change.

You came around, you came around
A silver lining
Found me again.

We're lonely people
All lookin' for somethin'
I'm reminded, i'm reminded.
I bare a cross that pulls down like an anchor
I'm reminded, i'm reminded.

Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh o o ohhhh.
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh o o ohhhh.

We can be found, we can be found
It's never too late
To change.

You came around, you came around

A silver lining
Found me again.

Here's all my love
All my love for you
I will open up.

Here's all my love
All my love for you
I will open up.

Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh o o ohhhh.

We can be found, we can be found
It's never too late
To change.

You came around, you came around
A silver lining
Found me again.

Here's all my love, all my love
A silver lining
Found me again.
Here's all my love, all my love
A silver lining
Found me again.



I do believe in something, you know.
I do believe in something, you know.
I do believe in something, you know.
I do believe in something, you know.
I do believe in something, you know.
Backwards lyric: "I do believe in something, you know."



And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothin' you can do about it
Nothin' you can do
No there's nothin' you can do about it
No there's nothin you can nothin' you can nothin' you can do about it

And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
Yeah

Hey he used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap 'B' movie

Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin you can nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts raging gets you more than half crazy
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
Now they start freaking everywhere you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cause reason's out of the window
Better hold on tight

You're rushing headlong
Headlong out of control - yeah
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothin you nothin' you nothin' you can do about it at all

Yeah yeah
Alright - go

And you're rushing headlong down the highway
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothin' - nothin' - nothin' you can do about it

Ah ha
Headlong
Yeah yeah yeah
Headlong
Headlong

Headlong
gnoldeaH gnoldeaH gnoldeaH gnoldeaH



And meets the worst
I came walking along and I
I came first
What will I do here now I said
I better quench my thirst
I woke up and stood up and said what's up then I
I looked around
I wanted to scream out to everyone
Look what I found
I couldn't even think straight let alone
Make a sound

I was so in love with who I thought you were
I was in the air
I was so in love with who I thought you were
And it wasn't fair

I sat down and thought for awhile then I
I heard a ring
I looked up to see that the white moths were
Were on the wing
Heaven and wood seemed to have
He'd be in the lead
Become one thing



And you could let me down, again.
But it's killing me,
I can't waste a sound, here.

You'll break me if you can.
You'll break me if you can.

Drag me down again, it's hard to be your scar,
A frozen satellite, you never got that far.
It's hard to be your scar, and cool like you.

Every sorry lie, I can't live that down now,
So you'll wait and see.
I'm caught between the seam and me.

And you'll break me if you can,
You'll break me, break me if you can.

Drag me down again, it's hard to be your scar,
A frozen satellite, you never got that far. Never got that far.
It's hard to be your scar, and cool like you.

I could hang around, you could let me down.

Drag me down again, it's hard to be your scar,
A frozen satellite, you never got that far. Never got that far.
So, drag me down again, it's hard to be your scar,
A frozen satellite, you never got that far. Never got that far.
You never got that far. Never got that far.
You never got that far...



That's when I know that I'm alive And all the things we'll leave behind 
We finally found what we can find

The rest of my life is falling to pieces
While we get lost inside the moment

The waves keep crashing at my door
'Til I can't hear them anymore
And all the time I gave away
Made me who I am today

The rest of my life is falling to pieces
And where would I be now without you baby

The rest of my life is falling to pieces

The rest of my life is falling to pieces
While we get lost inside the moment

The rest of my life is falling to pieces
And where would I be now without you baby



What i feel is nothing but the taste of you 
I get buried in your mouth 
I fall in, i don't care if i can't climb out 

Look at the moon but i see only you 
Three days away, i'm a man in a caravan 
By the sea 
Waving at the old folks waving at me 

I'll fall for you 
When i get on and shake my pride 
I'll call on you 
We can do better than i am tonight 

Be strong and you'll get strength back 
Feed the fire and you'll get warmth back 

I'm walking the plank, edging out, see the drop 
If i take a new step will you follow or stop? 
I look back from the ocean beneath to your eyes 
Are we in it together now? 

If you've got any doubt i'll cast them out 
I feel you close around me, i'm living for two 
And why i'm laughing i'll remember for you



Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cuz this love is everlasting

Suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love
Ooh

Girl you're everything a man could want and more
A thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love

Each day
I pray
This of love we feel will last forever

Suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love
You're in love

There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love



People around me hoping I don't die
I'm just taking a ride on a big balloon
And I promise I will be coming home real soon

I know where I'm gonna go and I don't wanna be this way

Surrounded by people that wanna watch me fall
But in my mind I will kill them all
Seeing enemy's dying at my feet
But really I'm just fighting me

I know where I'm gonna go and I don't wanna be this way
I don't wanna be I don't wanna be be this way

I see my self crawling on the floor
Time and time again its such a fucking bore
Looking for something that I know I wont find
Ignoring the signs from my rotten mind

I know where I'm gonna go and I don't wanna be this way
I don't wanna be I don't wanna be be this way



Is the rumour really true
Just in time, we're next in line
They're really after me and you
Since the demonstration
Clamping down on every side
Rounding up the kids at random
Army curfew every night
 
Don't repeat this conversation
Don't let on we've met before
Try and make like I'm a stranger
I'm a man you never saw
 
Church police were round this morning
And the army's on our track
Took away my books and papers
Only just got out the back
I just called in to tell you
That your place is being watched
Don't go into work tomorrow
Try and make it down the docks
 
Don't repeat this conversation
Don't let on we've met before
Try and make like I'm a stranger
I'm a man you never saw
 
Dump your car and burn your letters
Smash your glasses, cut your hair
Buy a suit and take a raincoat
When you go, don't tell us where
Take a look outside my window
I don't recognise that van
Someone standing in the doorway
Better make it while you can
 
Don't repeat this conversation
Don't let on we've met before
Try and make like I'm a stranger
I'm a man you never saw



Taste like luck but feels clear
March on nails for bitter souls
Until rust becomes rare and cold...

... Same stories have been played out for ages
I'm ready to be given the chance
For saying our side, our version or choice
Cameras capture
Numerous nights of romance

... Pass on null the essence
The undying patience
We're here for good



I'm so sore that I could cry always
In the night lay your tired arms

She will have her way
But somehow I will still believe her

She's the life I've been frightened of
Seems like deathly silence and especially the dark
Feels like I am heavy and my spirit has died

She will have her way
But somehow I will still believe her
She will have her way
And one day I will come back
Yeah

Do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Still no end in sight
Though I travel far and wide
A dying man is doing time
Thinker, soldier terrified

She will have her way
Somehow I will still believe her
She will have her way
One day I will come back

Do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do
Do do do
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah

Hey
She will have her way
...
Yeah she will have her way
She will have her way







Say something that'll make you laugh, that's exactly what you need,
And I hope that's me, I hope that's me.

Somebody's gonna get dressed up and take you out for valentine's,
Get lots of jealous looks thinking that's one lucky guy,
And I hope that's me, I hope that's me.

And you, you keep on wondering who, is gonna love you like I already do,
And I keep wondering when you'll see, that eventually.

Somebody's gonna throw on a ??,
When your fever hits a hundred and two,
Go down and pick your prescription up,
And come home and fix you soup,
And I hope that's me, I hope that's me.

Somebody's gonna buy a ring,
Somebody's gonna make you cry,
Somebody's gonna lift that veil,
And get to look into your eyes,
And I hope that's me, I hope that's me.

Cause you, you keep on wondering who, is gonna love you like I already do,
And I keep wondering when you'll see, maybe eventually.

Old man on a front porch swing,
Looking back on his long life,
Glass of ice tea in his hand,
Other arm around his wife.

And I hope that's you, I hope that's me.
I hope that's you, and I hope that's me.
I hope that's you, and I hope that's me.
I hope that's you, and I hope that's me.

I hope that's me.



Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, child ya' got a runnin' machine
Baby baby ride on Josephine, baby ride on


Well now Josephine drivin' a hotrod Ford
She got twin carburators, gonna burn up the road
Twin exhausts kickin' out the rear
Some a'that'll really take away from here

Ride on Josephine, baby ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, child ya' got a runnin' machine
Baby baby ride on Josephine, baby ride on


Well now Josephine's engine, said it started run hot
She tried to trade it in down the used car lot
The man couldn't believe his natural eyes
When she pulled it up into his drive

Ride on Josephine, baby ride on
Ride on Josephine, baby ride on
Ride on Josephine, girl ya' got a runnin' machine

Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, child ya' got a runnin' machine
Baby baby ride on Josephine, baby ride on



let me share the grief that lies behind your smile.
There's people turning bad feeling sad, misunderstanding,
And the world's going mad.
You watch TV, and you shake your tortured head.
And I watch the world,
And I really think we might be better off.

Father,you've been a long time so lonely,
Hear me now, Father,
You've got a stake in my soul, so console me.
I need it now, we need it now.

Genocide reveals the foulest swoop,
The sweetest lips received the soured fruit again,
A killer swears he's just a thief,
A thief declares he's just a victim of kinds.
And I watch the world, and there really isn't more to life than dying.

Father,you've been a long time so lonely,
Hear me now,Father,
You've got a stake in my soul,so console me
I need it now,we need it now.



Since I'd look at myself
I don't wanna have to change
If I don't then no one will
Is it my state of mind
Or is it just everything else
I don't wanna have to be here
I don't understand it now

Cause its been eighteen days
Since I first held you
But to me it feels just like
It feels like a lifetime
I'm trying hard to re-arrange
Some say its the hardest thing to do
But that's another eighteen days
Without you

Time after time
I've been through this
You show me what it means to live
You give me hope when I was hopeless
As my days fade to night
I remember that state of mind
I'm soaring straight into your heart
And I'll fly high

Cause it's been eighteen days
Since I first held you
But to me it feels just like
It feels like a lifetime
I'm trying hard to re-arrange
Some say it's the hardest thing to do
But that's just too many days
Without you

And I know what they say
About all good things
Will they come to an end
But I'll fight this time
So that we might
Have a chance at this

Cause it's been eighteen days
Since I'd look at myself
I don't wanna have to change
If I don't then no one will

Cause its been too many days

But I'll fight this time
So that we might
Have a chance at this



From the empire state wicket
Where we took it up 110
It was four for observatory
You're lookin' straight down to gridlock
Corner story
Let's go uptown tomorrow
We'll do it again

Don't wake me up I was having a dream
I was running from the cops
Getting away clean
It was a little excitement
I needed a dose and
I think I came close
I came close

Am I alone in this feeling?
Am I alone in this feeling?
Am I alone in this feeling?
Unshaven
Of course I am
Unshaven
Of course

Well those are dry words
We should moisten 'em up
With a drink
Are those my words?
Are you listening to me think?
It was four for observatory
You're lookin' straight down to gridlock
Corner story
Let's go uptown tomorrow
We'll do it again
We'll do it again
We'll do it again

Am I alone in this feeling?
Am I alone in this feeling?
Am I alone in this feeling?
Unshaven
Of course I am
Unshaven
Of course
I am



Ridin' on the wind
She had all of the answers
Didn't need to pretend
I remember - she was the only friend I ever needed

Now I wonder
How to work it all out
My hands are tremblin'
I've got this feelin' now

There's a bit of thunder
Pounding in my heart
A little uncertainty
That's been there from the start
Don't tell me all the looks you gave
Were the ones that I misread
'Cause all I hear now
Is a voice inside my head
 
Could this be love
That I hear calling
Could this be love
That I hear calling

Got a fast education
Holding you in tears
Someone's finally hurt you
After all these years
Got to get my message to you somehow

Now you're lookin' in my eyes for courage
Too late to think this through
Baby
There must be something we can do

There's a bit of thunder
Pounding in my heart
A little uncertainty
That's been there from the start
Don't tell me all the looks you gave
Were the ones that I misread
'Cause all I hear now
Is a voice inside my head
Could this be love
That I hear calling
Could this be love
That I hear calling
There's a bit of thunder
Pounding in my heart
A little uncertainty
That's been there from the start
Don't tell me all the looks you gave
Were the ones that I misread
'Cause all I hear now
Is a voice inside my head
Could this be love
That I hear calling
Could this be love
That I hear calling



I spend my mornings with God before I hit the grind
The subtleties of darkness never cease to amaze
As a physical world creates a spiritual haze 

Blinded by distractions
Lost in matterless affairs
Reaching through the darkness
Trusting You will meet me there 

Day by day, day by day
Day by day, day by day
Oh dear Lord, three things I pray one, two, three
To see thee more clearly day by day
To love thee more dearly day by day
To follow thee more nearly I got to take it
Day by day 

You cruise around the corner
You watch your back 

You sweep your feet down alley streets
Sometimes you creep, I never see you coming
Monday, man you're on my back
Like a knapsack strapped with my heavy burden 

No, You cannot condemn me
I won't buy your bag of goods
You've got nothing for me anyway
That's why I pray 

Day by day, day by day
Day by day, day by day
Oh dear Lord, three things I pray one, two, three
To see thee more clearly day by day
To love thee more dearly day by day
To follow thee more nearly I got to take it
Day by day

These three things
I do pray
Day by day 

Day by day, by day, by day
These three things
Day by day, by day, by day
I do pray
Day by day, by day, by day, by day 2x it's one step out of time 

Day by day, day by day
Day by day, day by day
Oh dear Lord, three things I pray one, two, three
To see thee more clearly day by day
To love thee more dearly day by day
To follow thee more nearly I got to take it
Day by day

As you walk
Day by day
Go to God and pray,
"I'm gonna go Your way"

I'm gonna pray
See thee more clearly every day
Love thee more dearly oooh, oh yeah
Follow thee more nearly I'm gonna go your way
Does any body hear me? 

Day by day, by day, by day by
Day by day, by day, by day by
Day by day, by day, by day, by day 

I know I'm always safe with you
One day at a time



You envy me and it's killing you eating you alive
And you know it makes me smile when I look in the mirror
Thinkin' how good it is to be king

And don't you wish you were me?
The king of all you see
Don't you wish you were me?
It ain't that easy
Don't think you'll ever be,
Everything a man should be
Cause Don't you wish you were me?
Keep dreamin' about being me

Too soon, you'll be a memory
There for all to see forever, just illusion just illusion
And sometimes it makes me laugh
When I see your reaction
Knowing that I've become mighty

And don't you wish you were me?
The king of all you see
Don't you wish you were me?
It ain't that easy
Don't think you'll ever be,
Everything a man should be
Cause Don't you wish you were me?
Keep dreamin' about being me

Inside my mind there is a freak
That drives me on past all defeat
You'll never have, you can't instill
The power of my iron will



And I'll stop coming 'round
Your flatmate in the front room,
He thinks he may have found - 
The last of the teenage lovers
Surprised by what I feel
The last of the teenage lovers
I'm learning how to deal

With the ease of the midnight visit
The ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith
That you might be alone

I was dreamin of you this morning
Dreaming all last night
Your greedy new manoeuvres,
They moke me up in fright
I watched the sunlight climbing up my bedroom door
Who had taught my sweetheart to ask for so much more

Ahh with the ease of the midnight visit
The ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith
That you might be alone

Born again to die again
My soul is in this body
Born again to die again
My soul is in this body
Better give it a bit of peace

I was trying to save your flatmate
From getting out of bed so late
Like a big old clumsy cat
Perched on top of your side gate
The last of the teenage lovers thinks
"What a way to go"
I'd call the ambulance myself
if could reach the phone
The last of the teenage lovers
"What a way to go"
Its not enough to be in love wth you
I want to be loved too

Yeah thats the ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith that you might be alone
Yeah that's the ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith that you might be alone.
Whens a fool like me gonna drive straight home?







Come away with me.
You perfect, perfect shell.
You nautilus, nautilus.

I will treat you so well,
I'll take you up from this hell.
My gracious host,
You're my lover,
Won't you be my concubine?

The pleasure's all mine,
Your pleasures are all mine.
To twist and turn around,
In figure eights and out of place.
Refuse the bounty of his right for the hunger of his left hand.

I'm the fervor of the fever you can't sweat.
I'm the garments stuck to your skin,
Drenched and dripping wet.
I'm a spring of flowing fume and fret.
A barren spring of fume and fret is coursing its way,
Through everything inside of me.
And I know what won't ever sink,
Will slowly swim to the bottom.

Just promise not to see me as I am Or what I'll become,
A pestilential scab,
The scarlet of sunburned skin.
I will stick to you like a wet cloth You just can't shed.
I will cling to you like a child to his mother's breast.
You fertile crop, I won't be shed.

I saw my shining shield and armor rust,
I felt my posture bow and fall to dust.
But all the vigils, and the stakes I claimed,
Couldn't take the sting from out my shame,
Couldn't take the color from the stain that I became.
The stain that I became.

I'm the fervor of the fever you can't sweat.
I'm the garments stuck to your skin,
Drenched and dripping wet.
I'm a spring of flowing fume and fret,
I'm the melody stuck inside your head.

What have I become?

Let your boyfriend deal with the dealers
It only gets inconvenient
When you want to get high alone

You don't have to know how to get home
Let your boyfriend tell the driver the best way to go
It only gets kind of weird
When you wanna go home alone

You don't have to know the inspiring people
Let your boyfriend know the inspiring people
You can hang in the kitchen
Talk about the stars and the upcoming sequel

If you get tired of your boyfriend's things
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
If you get tired of your boyfriend's scene
There's always other scenes, there's always other boyfriends

You don't have to deal with the dealers
Let your boyfriend deal with the dealers
It only gets inconvenient
When you want to get high alone

You don't have to go to the right kind of schools
Let your boyfriend come from the right kind of schools
You can wear his old sweatshirt
You can cover yourself like a bruise

If you get tired of your boyfriend's things
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
If you get tired of your football friends
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends

If you get tired of the the car he drives
There's always other boys, you can make him like you
If you get tired of the music he likes
There's always other boys, you can make him like you

They say you don't have a problem until you start to do it alone
They say you don't have a problem until you start bringing it home
They say you don't have a problem until you start sleeping alone

There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
There's always other boys, you can make him like you
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
There's always other boys, you can make him like you

There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
There's always other boys, you can make him like you
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
There's always other boys, you can make him like you



I find I'm yawning just a'scratchin' my head
I face the dawning and I feel like I'm dead
I been sleeping all alone
Well every daybreak as I wake from my sleep
I find I'm aching as I drag from the deep
If I were a Mustang I'd be a junk yard heap
Mirror don't lie mirror don't lie
Talk about a rolling stone

Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome

Well all these dragons are just a'draggin' me down
I've been picking things up from the underground
Like a trackless tram I'm Bondi bound
Sitting in the depot all alone
No purity no clear white walls
Just a big stampede when the Warragul calls
Times a'menacing just gnashes and mauls
Where'm I gonna buy it where'm I gonna buy it
Gotta give a dog a bone

I've been thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome

Well I've been living a catagorical lie
Each last thrill the penultimate high
Just one more hit before I can die
Yellow teeth are snappin' all around
Well every daybreak as I wake from my bed
I find I'm aching just a'scratchin' my head
If I were a Mustang I think it's gone to my head
Mirror don't lie mirror don't lie
Talk about a rolling stone

Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
I've been thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome



Goin' on, like I don't need you any more. 

That's like walking in the dark.
Tell me now, that you'll give me all your love.

Oh, give me your love,
Or nothing at all,
Oh, give me your love.

I've been everywhere and here I go again,
Looking out for me and, leaving you behind,
But let me hold you just one time,
Oh so will you give your love,
I'll know that you'll be mine.

Oh, give me your love,
Or nothing at all, nothing at all,
Oh, give me your love, give me your love,
Oh give me your love.

Oh, give me your love, oh give me your,
Or nothing at all, nothing at all,
Oh, give me your love, give me your love,
Or nothing at all,
Oh, give me your love, oh give me your,
Or nothing at all.



Or maybe I'm wrong,
We can fight for one single way to get along,
And we've all got to not shake down,
And I'm only missing the point,
And I guess that's the way I'm trying to generalize.

So I told my problems,
You're never going to get me,
If I'm too busy.
A social conscience,
Well I saw it on the TV,
At least it keeps me busy.

Oh maybe sometimes I find it hard to comply,
With people that don't look you in the eye,
And it's because of the commercial breakdown.

And I'm only missing the point,
It's what the media say and then expect your head to turn away.

So I told my problems,
You're never going to get me,
If I'm too busy.
A social conscience,
Well I saw it on the TV,
At least it keeps me busy.
Well am I right?

And I used to think that these things happen for a reason,
I used to think that these things happen for a reason....



I'm lost with the light in your eyes. Light in your eyes
I know that you're the one to take this for granted.
Would you give yourself up and

Follow me, into the future now
And let me show you, something you won't let go of
A perfect reason to keep me waiting here for you.
There's something about you I just can't figure out.

I would never alter our design.
I'm trying to reconsider our lives.

It's time to see that our real dreams
Are made of secrets we've been keeping

Follow me, into the future now
And let me show, something you won't let go of
A perfect reason to keep me waiting here for you.
There's something about you I just can't figure out.

I know nothing about perfection,
But I am certain that I am the one.



And she knows what she likes
She needs you and me, man
Like a fish needs a bike
Suffragette city
Don't bother her none
Cos the women's revolution
Is bound to come... and I say
 
Right on, sister
Right on sister, right on
 
She's a clear level thinker
Just look at her play
She's got it together
In most every way
The women's army is marching
And the weak shall be strong
Power to the sisters
Right on, right on... and I say
 
Right on, sister
Right on sister, right on



I'm looking back and down and watching it go by
Down at the stockyards cattle screaming, the trains squeak by again
I can see my breath and I'm so thankful I'm not one of them

The sound of the ground freezing is pounding once again
It comes with the wind that once wiped off our smiles
Alarm clock bells are screaming out the same routine again
Scrape open your eyes, rise and fucking shine, 7 am

Sit down, dead weight, and wonder
Unsure, unslept, uncovered
The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes
Through 5-3 eyes

Schoolyard freaks are freezing, pushed to the ground again
I'm looking up and west for black to fill the sky
The sound of bottles breaking still breaking in my ears
They opened just in time to empty out and gouge away the years

Sit down, dead weight, and wonder
Unsure, unslept, uncovered
The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes,
Through 5-3 eyes

Schoolyard freaks are bleeding, down getting kicked again
I can taste the earth and feel it in my eyes
The sound of cattle screaming, still screaming in my ears
They came in metal coffins, chained me up and hacked me off my years

Sit down, dead weight, and wonder
Unsure, unslept, uncovered
The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes,
Through 5-3 eyes



Who has chased away the moonbeams?
Who has pulled a blanket across the sky?
Who will sing in celebration
Throughout this land that's bound to die?

 oh, that's bound to die


Who will put an end to all this sadness?
Who hears the Earth that cries beneath the burning rain?
All truth reduced to piles of greed and madness
The accident remains the same

 oh, always the same


Mmm, said it's alright, seems okay
Robbery and evil and the stealing
From the body and the mind for the healing
Of the spirit and the pride and the will and the will of the land



There's evil, there's evil, there's evil going on




I love my brother, I must share the seed
That falls through fortune at my feet
The fate of nations and of all their deeds
Lies trapped inside these hearts of greed
Ooh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh

 Great Spirit come
 Come on, come on, come on
 Oh yeah


Ooh yeah. Ooh yeah,



 Come on, come on, come on ...

Ooh, we'll sing in celebration
Ooh, we'll sing in celebration
Ooh, we'll sing in celebration, celebration
Sing in celebration, now now now now Sing in celebration



Off guard, and your cue to begin your scheme
I took a chance, you took my heart
And then you took all my money
I was blind-sided by a smile
That wasn't what it seemed

I'm talking about last night

Your mouth was making words that seemed
At the time, very sensible
Your body trembled
And secretly called my name
You said," Can I see you later? -
Cause I'd like to spend some time with you..."
How could I know that it was only just for show? -
Cause when the lights came on
You were gone
I was standing all alone

Last Night

Rock Bottom is where you'll find me
If you really need me
Rock Bottom-
With the other victims of your game

Now I'm on the floor
And I'm back for more
And I'm praying to be your prey
Now you're not so sure
More than you bargained for?

Last Night



I try to find the truth between all the lies
When Bleeding is feeling and feeling ain't real
Will I see you when I open my eyes?
Will I see you when I open my eyes?

When Breathing's a burden we all have to bear
And trust is one thing we're taught never to share
Somehow you just seem to shine
When loving means breaking and saying goodbye

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe; a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you, I never get burned

Caught in a trap of what we're taught to believe
When night overcomes day, life's so hard to preceve
And the clock keeps on ticking through night-shattered skies
Where the stars are all broken, and so are all the ties
But the one thing remaining is you
When I'm broken and bleeding, you pull me right through

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe; a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you there's nothing I'd rather do

Than be right there
To escape my own life and all my fear
And I can't feel
Am I really real?
Come and wipe all my tears
Come and wipe all my tears

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe; a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you...

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe; a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you, I never get burned



What it is you see.
Is it something different?
Is it something sacred?
Throw away the outside,
Take away the fear,
I'll just wait here quietly.

Yet no matter,
What they do, never let them take what you have,
What they say, never gonna change who you are.

Try to hide the pain
Smiling on the outside,
Fighting desperation.
Is it something Deadly?
Anybody listening?
Anybody hear?
Show the world your brokenness.

Yet no matter,
What they do, never let them take what you have,
What they say, never gonna change who you are.

Faceless words, rush like wind
Guard my broken thoughts to heal,
Emotionless, to fields I fly,
Smashing through these panes to rest.



You used to lean on me – the only other choice was falling down.
You used to walk with me like we had no where we needed to go
Nice and slow, to no place in particular.

We used to have this figured out.
We used to breathe without a doubt.
When nights were clear you were the first star that I'd see.
We used to have this under control.
We never thought... we used to know.
At least there's you, and at least there's me.
Can we get this back?
Can we get this back to how it used to be?

I used to reach for you when I got lost along the way.
I used to listen – you always had the just right thing to say.
I used to follow you, never really cared where we would go
Fast or slow to anywhere at all

We used to have this figured out.
We used to breathe without a doubt.
When nights were clear you were the first star that I'd see.
We used to have this under control.
We never thought we used to know.
At least, there's you and at least there's me.
Can we get this back?
Can we get this back to how it used to be?

I look around me and I want you to be there
‘Cause I miss the things that we shared.
I look around you – it's empty and you're sad
‘Cause you miss the love that we had.

You used to talk to me like I was the only one around
The only one around.

We used to have this figured out.
We used to breathe without a doubt.
When nights were clear you were the first star that I'd see.
We used to have this under control.
We never thought we used to know.
At least there's you and at least there's me.
Can we get this back?
Can we get this back to how it used to be?
To how it used to be?
To how it used to be?
To how it used to be?



Of light and darkness
I lost it the ability to see myself more clearly
I lost it the ability to see

Have you found what you've been looking for
Now you've killed all your enemies
But you still want more
When your hate finds the love that it can't destroy
And when the cancer's all gone
We're still growing old old older

I know that you're fearless I bought it
What brought you to your knees
Your rage is visible so nearly
Intelligence sets you free
My mind is clearly undoing
The ability to see

Have you found what you've been looking for
Now you've killed all your enemies
But you still want more
When your hate finds the love that it can't destroy
And when the cancer's all gone
You're still growing old

To see
Have you found what you've been looking for
Now you've killed all your enemies
But you still want more
When your hate finds the love that it can't destroy
And when the cancer's all gone
We're still growing old

Old old older
You're still growing old old older



because it makes me HAPPY
My mind is CREEPY... I guess IT COULD BE
Depends on what you ASK ME

Your are my BRIGHT RED SCREAM
Girl wet dream
Your are my BRIGHT RED SCREAM
And when I sleep I dream of you

You say I'm SCARY... I guess I COULD BE
cause when I speak you FEAR ME
My mouth is DIRTY... I guess IT WOULD BE
Pretend you just don't HEAR ME

You are my BRIGHT RED SCREAM
Girl wet dream
You are my BRIGHT RED SCREAM
Nothing is what it will seem...
And I'm your SCARY TEDDY BEAR

LOVE me HATE me... I let you DRIVE ME CRAZY
CRUCIFY me or o do you wanna SAVE ME
YES, NO MAYBE... it doesn't matter BABY
You're not so CLEAN that I can't make you wanna SCREAM
SCREAM, SCREAM, SCREAM with me...

BRIGHT RED SCREAM
Girl wet dream
You are my BRIGHT RED SCREAM
SCREAM WITH ME
SCREAM FOR ME
I'm not mean... I'm just not nice
And there's a difference
THANK YOU ARE REMAINING AT A SAFE DISTANCE!



leaving the past behind me
curiously peeping behind each door
already longing for tomorrow
there's no need to fear as long as you're here

it's not always easy, not always plain
you cannot evade your sorrow
those are the terms in this old game
give and forgive for tomorrow
there's no need to fear - I will be here

all of the reasons were lost in the wave
I scrabble around for reassurance
dragging my grapnel athwart the sea
scanning my book of hours



I'll be standing on the steps of the hall
Waving til I find you
You said "be there or be square
And meet me outside the hall"
How can I refuse
Such an eloquent misuse of
A phrase that I never would

In the back of your mind
You're leaving alone
But after you leave
You'll be breathing alone

Could I Could I circle?
Could I Could I circle?
Could I Could I circle?
Could I?

Still by the side of the city halls
Five minutes is a month in the past
When no one's waiting to find you
People stop and stare at me outside the hall
And in our lives we don't succeed
But the rain in Albion Street
Fills a silence that no words could

In the back of your mind
You're leaving alone
But after you leave
You'll be breathing alone

Could I Could I circle?
Could I Could I circle?
Could I Could I circle?
Could I?

Ohhh

Could I Could I circle?
Could I Could I circle?
Could I Could I circle?
Could I?



You gotta live right
Go to school and keep your grades tight
And you mustn't miss a round
Keep your nose to the ground
But the thing that I found

I can't do that it just ain't me
Yeah, I dunno, you better ask somebody
Still I hear 'em tellin' me to get my degree
Sayin' it's the only way I'm gonna succeed

Well I don't necessarily wanna live that way
I make my own rules when I play
This game
Called life I know you think I'm crazy
But I don't necessarily wanna live like that
So when I'm coming up to bat
You think I'm a failure
But I got heart
And I'm gonna hit this out the park

I just don't wanna live that way

See I'm just trynna live my life
I got my own way of doing things
Now sayin' "you're wrong"
Which just ain't right for me
This is what I know
So this is how I do
Well that's just how I do

I go against the grain
And I'll be just fine
Stand up from the crowd
I'm gonna get mine
There's a fraction 
Too much friction

But I love fire works
Let us see the sparks flying?

Well I don't necessarily wanna live that way
I make my own rules when I play
This game
Called life I know you think I'm crazy
But I don't necessarily wanna live like that
So when I'm coming up to bat
You think I'm a failure
But I got heart
And I'm gonna hit this out the park

And no-one seems to get this
No I'm not bein' rebellious
I just don't wann to live that way
I can't help it, it's just me
And maybe one day you'll see
That I just make my own rules when I play

But I don't necessarily wanna live like that
So when I'm coming up to bat
You think I'm a failure
But I got heart
And I'm gonna hit this out the park

Well I don't necessarily wanna live that way
I make my own rules when I play
This game
Called life I know you think I'm crazy
But I don't necessarily wanna live like that
So when I'm coming up to bat
You think I'm a failure
But I got heart
And I'm gonna hit this out the park



The ones that fell when you shot through
A sky that burned not to return
No other element would do
Her soul was grown in the bathroom
Her heart is just a red baloon
I gave her lips from wild orchids
When she came out of the cocoon


Not the real thing
Not the real thing
Not the real thing
I can barely see the sun 
Now it's blue
I can barely see the sun
Because she kissees like a prototype

I programmed her with eye color
Majestic emerald green
Uploaded with your attitude
She will do it like a machine
But no matter how hard I've tried
She never smiles unless she's high
And just like you 
Won't ever stop crying

She kisses like a prototype of you

Please come back and rescue me from the machines
And I'll be wondering why you do it with somebody else
Please come back and rescue me from the machines
And I'll be wandering while you do it with somebody else

Not the real thing
Not the real thing
Not the real thing
I can barely see the sun 
Now it's blue
I can barely see the sun
She's a prototype of you
Not the real thing
Not the real thing
Not the real thing
I can barely see the sun 
Now it's blue
I can barely see the sun
Because she kisses like a prototype
Her she kisses like a prototype



I saw beauty
Girls wished for boys and scared them away
I saw beauty

Alright, alright
My feet keep on taking me back, back, back to those places
Alright, alright
My knees keep on shaking from fright, fright, fright

Scared and cold now you're old
Time thaws but you break
There's a hole in my soul
How much more can it take?

Alright, alright
My feet keep on taking me back, back, back to those places
Alright, alright
My knees keep on shaking from fright, fright, fright

I saw, I saw
And it moved all the grey aside
I saw, I saw
And it moved all the grey aside

Alright, alright
My feet keep on taking me back, back, back to those places
Alright, alright
My knees keep on shaking from fright, fright, fright



If I had to take the choice between the deafman and the blind
I know just where my feet should go and that's enough for me
I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing out towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, 'Just look behind'

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road



Now how am I to know just what to do. 
With two bare hands alone. 
I'm stuck with the past. 
And the whys of love that was ment to last. 

I took it all for granted. 
All the riches of life I had it. 
I found out too late. 
And each night and each day. 
I'm lost in the bygone zone. 
And I took it all for grantes. 
Making pure love grow tainted. 
I can't change her mind. 
Or turn back the time. 
I'm lost in the bygone zone, alone. 

Now and then I see her passing by. 
Not aware that she still occupies. 
Every square of my mind moved on. 
Got on with her life. 
A brand new glow in her familiar eyes. 

I took it all for granted. 
All the riches of life I had it. 
I found out too late. 
And each night and each day. 
I'm lost in the bygone zone. 
And I took it all for grantes. 
Making pure love grow tainted. 
I can't change her mind. 
Or turn back the time. 
I'm lost in the bygone zone, alone. 

All in all her world was made for two. 
Wish I could share mine with someone that beautiful. 
But it's way too late. 
I'm stuck with the dreams 
Of a love I tore up at the seems. 

I took it all for granted. 
All the riches of life I had it. 
I found out too late. 
And each night and each day. 
I'm lost in the bygone zone. 
And I took it all for grantes. 
Making pure love grow tainted. 
I can't change her mind. 
Or turn back the time. 
I'm lost in the bygone zone, alone.



And she say, "No, no, no, no, no"
I want to squeeze her tight and not offend her, yeah
She said, "No, no, no, no, no"
And he thought that she was coming back, but she wrote him a letter
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door

Seems as though you've got your way before
You left me standing helpless just when I need more
You broke my heart for the last time; you broke my heart for the last time
You broke my heart for the last time, goodbye Elenore

I tried to tell the boys all about her, yeah
And they say, "No, no, no, no, no"
They told me she was loose, no doubt about her
Well I say, "No, no, no, no, no"
And he thought that she was coming back, but she wrote him a letter
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door

Seems as though you've got your way before
You left me standing helpless just when I need more
You broke my heart for the last time; you broke my heart for the last time
You broke my heart for the last time, goodbye Elenore

Seems as though you've got your way before
You left me standing helpless just when I need more
You broke my heart for the last time; you broke my heart for the last time
You broke my heart for the last time, goodbye Elenore

You broke my heart for the last time, broke my heart, it's the last time
You stole my heart and now you're gone forevermore



Little by little, I call your name
Little by little, my tears fall
Little by little, everything changes

Little by little, the time go
Little by little, the days pass by
Little by little, the air clears
Little by little, I can breathe again

I can breathe again
I can breathe again, now
I can breathe again

Back at the mirror, your good friend
Talk to the mirror, play out your game
Slap in the middle, I stop then
Look at the winner and the price you pay, mmm

Cold was the winter, I tremble
Long was the fall that had no end
Now little by little, the air clears
Little by little, I can breathe, I can breathe again

I can breathe again
I can breathe again, now

Call your name, call your name
Call your name, call your name
Everything changes, everything changes
I call your name

Oh, I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
Ooh, ooh
Little by little



Are those teardrops in your eyes,
Is it more blues - is it bad news,
Is it a curse, or a blessing in disguise?

Did you leave him - do you love him,
Have you said your - said your last goodbyes,
Is it over - hey, are you sorry,
Could it be a blessing in disguise?

It's the scars that make you stronger,
It's the hard times that make you wise,
It's the sweet things only time brings,
That arrive like a blessing in disguise.

Clouds roll by - and bring the rain,
Tears will dry - and ease the pain,

Ohh are you lonely - are you crying,
Are those teardrops - teardrops in your eyes,
Ohh is it more blues - is it bad news, yeah,
Is it a curse or a blessing in disguise,
Is it a curse or a blessing in disguise,
Ohh is it a curse or a blessing in disguise.



Back home to you 
I'm beating my retreat 
Back home to you 
I'm burning all my bridges 
I'm burning all my bridges 
I'm burning all my bridges 
I'm running back home to you 

I'm trailing my colours 
Back home to you 
I'm trailing my colours 
Back home to you 
This world is filled with sadness 
This world is filled with sadness 
This world is filled with sadness 
I'm running back home to you 

I'll follow the drum 
Back home to you 
I'll follow the drum 
Back home to you 
There was no joy in my leaving 
There was no joy in my leaving 
There was no joy in my leaving 
I'm running back home to you



Then leave me
Then leave me
I can't take
Seeing your face
Please believe me

Use me
Forsake me
Believe me

You're all the same
I wear your shame
Don't try and hide
With alibis
Can't take the blame
Fucked up your name
Please come inside
Never mind

Don't believe
Every angle
Every moment
You can't see
Your soul is brittle
From my torment

Use me
Forsake me
Believe me

You're all the same
I wear your shame
Don't try and hide
With alibis
Can't take the blame
Fucked up your name
Please come inside
Never mind



A face I know, not the one that I remember
I wanted to hide but I cant run out on you forever
Milky eyes like opal stones
Staring through a stained glass window
It's never too late to change your mind
Looking through a stained glass window 
It's never too late

I know a man, couldn't change the peace that stands between us
But these open hands are empty bowls to fill
Come for the one who pays the most
You don't get thanks for loyalty
And all your friends, they've gone and sold you down the river
They've got your phone book now
Once your life was a fiery feast
Now it's just a burning ember

It's never too late
We'll get it back together
It's never too late
Release me from this sorrow

Will you never learn, love knows no bounds
Beggar or a king, it will bring you down
Fool may I be, cant give up the ghost that haunts me

I saw a face, grey as a cold December

It's never too late



Knew what to say
But lost the way
And he forgot to be strong
Aching to shout it wears me out

I've come to like sandy
I lean over
Don't think about it
There is water inside your heart

In tragedy park
Staging it there
With seeds to spare
And now they made a place seem
Achingly clean towards the gleam

I've come to like sandy
I lean over say you're sorry
Don't break the bottle
There is water inside your heart, no say you're sorry

I've come to like sandy
He is my friend say you're sorry
Don't think about it
There is water inside your heart, no

Forgot to be strong
Aching to shout it wears me out

Hello buddies



Tell 'em, all to go 
Once for the money 
But I'm, through with the show 
An' move with me gently, 
Oh so slow 
Hold me and maybe, oh, 
We'll never let go 
Never let go 
I'm through with sneakin' 
Been cutting it close 
Through with the two-step, 
Oh Where the rhythm is lost 
Through with the two-step 
Where the rhythm is lost 

Oh, yes, it's love in any key 
You opened up the door 
Now I know, it's got to be 

Now my cards on the table, 
Hands on the deck 
Now "A" is for able, 
All words spoken right 
My willing baby, 
Now can't you see 
Little girl, it's not for me. 

So you waltzed into my life, 
One two three 
Warmth of your smile 
Oh, let it please be me, 
Please let it be me 
You switch and swirl, 
Oh, swing and sway 
Stay till the sun comes, and, don't go away 
Stay till the sun comes, and, don't go away 
Stay till the sun comes, and, don't go away 
Don't go away, don't go away, aah 

It might be cozy baby, please don't go now 
And it's buy me, don't buy me baby, baby 
Please don't go, oh 
Oh, don't go away now baby 
And it's bye, me, baby now please don't go away 
And it's bye, now baby, baby 
Baby, please don't go.



A can of one or two, or eight won't touch
For what it's in, I got amends
With an empty milk bottle and a screaming hand

You are my hero
You are my hero
You are my hero
You are my hero
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You are my hero
You are my hero
You are my hero
You are my hero
I, don't, know

I try my best, to still have fun
Cowboys and Indians, more pies you can burst
For what it's in, I got amends
With an empty milk bottle and a screaming hand

You are my hero
You are my hero
You are my hero
You are my hero
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You are my hero
You are my hero
You are my hero
You are my hero
I, don't, know

Look at that young boy, he's older now
He thought that life was simple
But he's finding out
He sees how hard things were, for his old man
With an empty milk bottle and a screaming hand



When she’s around
But I know when she leaves
My head hangs down

Is it her looks, her ways
That makes me care?
I always seem to see her
Everywhere

My-y-y how I wonder
What makes me feel
The way I feel
When I’m ‘round her, oh yeah

When I see her
I feel funny inside
Should I look? Should I talk?
Or should I hide?

I should go up to her
And ask her her name
But she might take me wrong
And I’ll feel ashamed

My-y-y how I wonder
What makes me feel
The way I feel
When I’m ‘round her, oh yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh...ooh, ooh, ooh…
I wonder…
Ooh, ooh, ooh...ooh, ooh, ooh…
I wonder…
Ooh, ooh, ooh...ooh, ooh, ooh…
I wonder…



A true bride won't burn what's close to her heart
If I don't make it back, will you keep me

I'm gonna love you like I should
Faithfully unchanging
I'm gonna love you like I should
Faithfully unchanging

A true bride doesn't deserve the weight we offer
A true bride doesn't deserve to be misunderstood
If I don't make it back, will you keep me
If I don't make it back, I need to know you'll keep me

I'm gonna love you like I should
Faithfully unchanging
I'm gonna love you like I should
Faithfully

I'm gonna love you like I should
Faithfully unchanging
I'm gonna love you like I should
Faithfully unchanging

She is a song written fully for worship
She is my home
She is a city built for more that profit
She is my home



Higher than any plane.

Nobody knows you
And everyone knows your name.

Talk in third person
As if you're someone else.

Pockets are breaking
From an overflow of wealth.

From up here where I stand
A speck of dust I see.

And though I love you all
You look like ants to me.

Feel like you're falling
No one can understand.

Fear overtaking
Like a giant in the land.

Path is obstructed
Clouds you can't see through.

Vision is failing
Lacking a Godly view.

Flying up above it all
Falling reminds me just how small.

Fearing the insignificance of mortal man.



They'll only hold you down,
leave you wanting more.
But you refuse to listen, babe,
so this is where you'll stay, 
If you weren't so bloody juvenile, 
you'd be some where today.
If you want it, you got it,
If you want it, you got it,
If you want it, you got it now.

You think you want a break but I got news for you, 
I think it's time you start believing your reviews. 
Stood me up and shot me down so many times before,
But dropping names and playing games won't get you through my door.

If you want it, you got it, 
If you want it, you got it, 
If you want it, you got it now.



Are you dreaming, of someone to love
Do you know what I'm thinking
But I guess you don't
Cause you'd have to be around
To hear my thoughts

Tomorrow's another day, and today is yesterday
And I don't care what you think you have to say
Tomorrow comes and today is gone
And I'm sick and tired of everyone trying to make me
Somebody Else

It's funny how you destroyed the better part of me
There's nothing left so there's nothing anybody can see
It's been six months now and you  think you found everything
In a day I wasn't there, in a way you didn't care


bridge
I didn't settle, I just got lazy
But I could see where you'd make the mistake
I didn't try, I just gave up
It was better to leave than stay
It's easy when you're leaving
It's harder when you try to return
But I haven't got that far yet
And that's a lesson I never want to learn

I should know better, and so should you
I'm exactly where you left me, there was nothing better to do
Are you still sleeping, are you still dreaming
I'm finally leaving, but you're still with me




Baby, don't you know nothing good happens after midnight?
You see the night before I couldn't keep my hands off her,
Yeah I wanted to drink her up.
Her body burned like a fire and I knew, I knew I couldn't take anymore from her.

I'm burn burn burning,
My stomachs turning,
My hearts giving into my eyes.
I'm stare stare staring
At the skin shes sharing,
My hearts giving into my eyes.
Not it's too late, for me it's too late,
I'm burn burn burning, yeah my hearts giving into my eyes.

She stood 5'4
She had the brightest green I'd ever seen, I've never seen these eyes before.
And just like that I was hypnotized.
I sit back, I roll fat, thinking of you again.
And I knew I couldn't take anymore from her.

I'm burn burn burning,
My stomachs turning,
My hearts giving into my eyes.
I'm stare stare staring
At the skin shes sharing,
My hearts giving into my eyes.
Not it's too late, for me it's too late,
I'm burn burn burning, yeah my hearts giving into my eyes.

I'm sweating bullets like a boy that has just been caught,
You say your love is all I need, but I don't need a lot.
You say you're sorry but I know that you're not

I'm burn burn burning,
My stomachs turning,
My hearts giving into my eyes.
I'm stare stare staring
At the skin shes sharing,
My hearts giving into my eyes.
Not it's too late, for me it's too late,
I'm burn burn burning, yeah my hearts giving into my eyes



Go out and find yourself a new plaything 
Oh girl you need a trip 
'Cause he's not worth the misery and pain 

So just remember how he would tell you lies 
And then pretend that everything was so sweet 
No need to sacrifice 
If you're not satisfied 
He's just a canine running round on heat 

Girl, you must resist 
Don't let him squirm his way into your heart 
Oh girl you must insist 
You've got to stop the fool before he starts 

So just remember how he was so untrue 
And all the tacky things he did to you 
No need to sympathise 
'Cause he's not worth the time 
You've got to find someone who's true to you 

Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad 
Girlfriend, you know you're the best he's ever had 
Girlfriend



out on the coast, or rushed into the brine?
you left your rings on the shoreline
so you wouldn't lose them swimming in the shallows

a plastic shovel, soft sweaty children far from home
on vacation not unlike your very own

and the Captain Howdy lit upon my shoulder
and he left me with sulphur and rooms full of headaches
I fell in with snakes in the poisoned ranks of strangers
please send me more yellow birds for the dim interior

will my pony recognise my voice in hell?
will he still be blind, or do they go by smell?
will you promise not to rest me out at sea
but on a fiery river boat that's rickety?

I'll never find my pony along the rolling swell
a muddy river or a lake would do me well
with hints of amber sundowns and moody thunderstorms
a sunken barge's horns, with the cold rusty bells



Lost in a dream of you
Where is the love I once knew
Why did we part

Bewildered
I'm helpless without you dear
Wishing your heart could hear
What's in my heart

Why must I have sleepless nights
And endless days
But love, you left my soul
Without a thought
I'm in the dark

Bewildered
I need your guiding hand
I will never understand
How could you leave me bewildered

Why must I have sleepless nights
And endless days
But love, you left my soul
Without a thought
I'm in the dark

Bewildered
I need your guiding hand
I will never understand
How could you leave me bewildered



Thin petals heed the warning
Does she know her friends are calling her?
A heads-up from the morning sun
Suggests she's feeling cluttered up
Before she gets her singing done

I'd say rake in a holiday right away
We'll take it up early to the runway
Before they get away
She says calm down, I'll remember

So what if she's not fessing up
How true to blue her lyrics come
The ones we'd like to hat ego love
Before they turn their backs on her
Let up your hands and clap for her
Seems easier for everyone

She says calm down
I'll remember which ones they are, they are
Before December's come and gone

It's something of a problem some
To know her work is never done
She knows the season's clocking her
If not for these good deeds she's done
And words in notes she's learned and sung
This need she leaves would never come

She says calm down
I'll remember which ones they are, they are
Before December's come and gone



It's a miracle that you've found me
I can't fool myself any longer
We're both willing, young and able
Let's put our cards on the table
This feelin's gettin' stronger
I see the sunlit tears in your eyes again
Now I realize
Maybe it's the right time
Oh, maybe you're the right one
Ooh, and now I understand
You could've slipped through my hands
Well, I just can't wait anymore
There's a chance we can make it
We just gotta take it

Endless are the nights
I stay with you
Endless are the dreams
You made come true
Forever in my arms
You're the reason tonight our love is endless

We better get ourselves together
Before we hit bad weather
And we can't go any further
Won't you give me some affection
Point me in the right direction
This storm is blowin' harder
Here comes that voice deep inside again
And it says to me
That maybe it's the right thing
Oh, maybe you're the right one
Ooh, and now I understand
You could've slipped through my hands
Well, I just can't wait anymore
There's a chance we can make it
We just gotta take it

Endless are the nights
I stay with you
Endless are the dreams
You made come true
Forever in my arms
You're the reason tonight our love is endless



I guess I lay awake, I guess I'll lay here and pray
Could you pour me one more drink? A glass of gasoline
Help me burn my pain, light me up in the rain
My so-called life is so good

Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Slow down

You wonder how I've been, you ain't been checking in
Just hope my vital signs would send me home again
My baby's in the grass, Jesus on the dash
I drive myself insane just hoping I could stay
My so-called life is so good

Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Slow down

Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down

When deserts turn into floods, White orchids cover with mud
No magic carpet today, not today
Who takes the reigns when I'm gone disintegrate from my throne?
No magic carpet today, not today

Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Why do we die?



Ain't too funny, honey, when it's just begun,
To trust somebody and you give it all away.

There goes another broken heart.
Here comes another rainy day.
Yeah...rainy day.

Oh, I've seen it way too many times before.
A love gone bad can make you wanna hit the floor,
Cryin' and beggin', but no matter what you say...
There goes another broken heart.
Here comes another rainy day.

Give it some time. It's alright. It'll go away.
Cuz in due time, you'll find there's another day.
I said, another day!

I'm not tryin' to tell you people what to do.
I'm singin' you a story 'bout the things that I been through.
I know the feeling when love walks away.
There goes another broken heart.
Here comes another rainy day.

Give it some time. It's alright. It'll go away.
Cuz in due time, you'll find there's another day.
I said, another day.

Broken hearts, they mend. Rainy days, they end. 
Well just keep tryin'. Don't give up.
Here comes a sunny day, a brighter and better way.
Live and love.

Oh, here comes a sunny day,
A brighter and better way
To live and love, and live and love, and live and love, and live and love.

Oh yeah

There goes another broken heart.
Here comes another rainy day.



to get my head straight
its not like anybody would know
i got a silver cloud
high above me
running circles around and around me

and i got nothing better to do

I wanted you so desperately, 
So baby,
Don't look now cause I'm comin' around,
Baby don't look now cause I'm comin' around.

You planned it all so carefully, 
You just faded to black,

Do you know how much you want him?

You're trying to big about it 
You're constantly just denying 
You're like a moth to a flame 
Can hardly wane 
But listen 'cos I know what I'm saying 

He's trying to catch you in it 
And then he'll back you in it 
Cos he's just another girl addict 
And if you give it away

Stay, stay a little longer, do you have to go away
Stay, stay for tomorrow, then I will know, if I'd rather be alone
Take, take a moment of time and turn it back, so we can start from scratch
Suppose, I leave all I got, would it make it easier on your heart

Well I'll take what I can before you leave
That is just a smile
I'll see you more that's why I can watch you breathe
That is all right
Come on and show me that silky skin
Your o so fine
I know we could turn it right
I know we could turn it right
So right

Throw, throw me a lifeline
We had a team
Would you save me if it all goes wrong
Grab, grab me cause I'm yours
Forever that's for sure
That's what I want you to tell me

Well I'll take what I can before you leave
That is just a smile
I'll see you more that's why I can watch you breathe
That is all right
Come on and show me that silky skin
Your o so fine
I know we could turn it right
I know we could turn it right
It's all an illusion
Easier said than done
Let's make a conclusion
This is worth it if we try

I'll take what I can before you leave
That is just a smile
I'll see you more that's why I can watch you breathe
That is all right
Come on and show me that silky skin
Your o so fine
I know we could turn it right
Ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahhhhhhhhhhh

Come on and show me that silky skin
Your o so fine
I know we could turn it right
I know we could turn it right



You shouldn't have driven - but we got there
Had a good time, so we left the car
And the cabby was from a war-zone
We were glad he was driving us home
I was gladder of some movement
You took it on, you took it on board
I said "Thank you, thank you, for loving me at my worst" 

If this isn't love it's very close
Can you hear the world is waking up?
Can we be crazy for a few more years?
Have I got them in me? 

Bought myself one of those keyboard axes
Wanted to get out and dance away from the piano
That could have been the beginning of the end
If I wasn't already in the middle
The crowd was confused - and then they cheered
My career it was back on track
I was relieved, full of love for the people
I said "Thank you, each and every one of you,
For loving me at my worst" 

If this isn't love it's very close
Can you hear the world is waking up?
Can we be crazy for a few more years?
Have I got them in me? 

All you bright and middle-aged things
Attending your sons and daughters
Spare a thought for me out here with the kids
To hell with your bricks and mortar 

It's you and me and the Holy Ghost
On the road to dawn heading down the coast
We're better sorry than safe when you count the cost
Mmm sorry than safe when you count the cost 

There's a bar out east called Scrum
Only red wine and the finest of cigars
And if we leave now we'll still get in
You can find yourself a young consort
Writers of unpopular fiction are trying to drink more
Than bikies who've all left their beards at the door
You'll drink all the wine and smoke your cigar
And say "Thank you, thank you, for loving me at my worst" 

If this isn't love it's very close
Can you hear the world is waking up?
Can we be crazy for a few more years?
Have I got them in me?



Always waitin' after the show,
She was the queen of the Hollywood Hills,
Knew the stars, the bars, the pimps and pills.

Somebody's climbin' on a Greyhound tonight,
Too much lipstick and her dress real tight,
Looks like a woman but she ain't quite,
No, not quite.

She's somebody's baby,
She's somebody's mother's child,
She may look like a lady,
But she's just a flower grown wild.

They never knew you by your childhood name,
But they were drawn to you like moths to a flame,
Nobody saw the tears in your silk n' lace,
Or the scarred little kid behind your face,
Just remember when you hold her tight,
What you're holding in your arms tonight,
She's no angel, but that's alright,
Yeah that's alright.

She's somebody's baby,
She's somebody's mother's child,
She may look like a lady,
But she's just a flower grown wild,
C'mon lets go, hey.

Just another little pretty thing,
Another angel with a broken wing,
Who fell to earth ‘neath the Hollywood Hills,
Amid the stars and the bars, the pimps and pills.

Just like the girl on the movie screen,
She played it up until the very last scene,
The picture faded and the day was done,
Went home to nothin' but a loaded gun.

Somebody's climbing on a Greyhound tonight,
A little angel flyin' out of sight,
Looks like a woman but she ain't quite,
No, not quite.

She's somebody's baby,
She's somebody's mother's child,
She may look like a lady,
But she's just a flower grown wild - Yeah,
A flower grown wild,
She's somebody's baby - Looks like a lady.

She's somebody's baby,
She's somebody's mother's child,
She may look like a lady,
But she's just a flower grown wild.



Did I tell you I'm feeling old since you went away
Did I tell you my love was cold like the desert night
Did I tell you my heart was dry like the desert sky


Oh, will you love me again, won't you help out a friend
Will you love me again

Did I tell you my lips were cold like the desert night
Did I tell you my heart was dry like the desert sky
And if I need anyone to hold will you say you might




You're telling every one your moment's come
And you've found what you've been looking for

When you say love
You said the only word that tells the world
You never will be lonely anymore

You've got a pretty rainbow all your own
And at last you found your pot of gold
You're completely satisfied
A feeling of contentment fills your soul

When you say love
It means you've found your special one
And that you care enough to give your very best

When you say love
There's not another word that says so much
'Cause that four letter word means happiness

Your heart is given wings to touch the sky
It's higher than an eagle dares to fly
If you took every thing you've heard, try to make a magic word
You'll find you said it all when you say love

When you say love
It means you've found your special one
And that you care enough to give your very best

When you say love
There's not another word that says so much
'Cause that four letter word means happiness

Your heart is given wings to touch the sky
It's higher than an eagle dares to fly
If you took every thing you've heard, try to make a magic word
You'll find you said it all when you say love
You'll find you said it all when you say love

When you say love
When you say love



And i can't tell you anything about the early hours
Woken by another on the floor
Trying to forget they're getting pushed upon the floor
My head it hurts
My eyes are blurred

See me standing naked in the pain
Running rings around me like a pixie on a plane
Burnt your head a halo i'm a clown
Break another record if it makes you feel alone

My head it hurts, my eyes are blurred

But i want everyone to know that nothing is important everythings alright
I never need to to worry Battle knows the story everythings alright

See me standing naked in the pain 
Running rings around me like a pixie on a plane
Burned your head a halo i'm a clown
Break another record if it makes you feel alone

My head it hurts, my eyes are blurred
But i want everyone to know that nothing is important everythins alright
I never need to worry Battle knows the story everythings alright.

Back again alive i don't know how.
And i can't tell you anything somehow
Awoken by another on the floor
Try forget to push against the door

See me standing naked in the pain
Running rings around me like a pixie on a plane
Burnt your head a halo i'm a clown
Break another record if you're down

But i want everyone to know that nothing is important everythings alright
I never need to worry Battle knows the story everythings alright
I wantI want everyone to know that nothing is important everythings alright
I never need to worry Battle knows the story everythings alright.



But why have you been so, why have you been ill informed?
I felt that fire could protect me from everything
You're just too gullible

Actually it's darkness, I don't know what I'm scared of
It's darkness, I must be scared of something
You must be scared of something, quite quite special

You shed a shade of shyness
You shed a shade of shyness
You shed a shade of shyness
Why can't you be more cynical?

I knew the winter could protect me from it
One box if film won't make it all go cold
I thought that winter could hide me from everything
I'm just too gullible, for words

Actually it's darkness, I don't know what I'm scared of
It's darkness, I must be scared of something
You must be scared of something, quite quite special

You shed a shade of shyness
You shed a shade of shyness
You shed a shade of shyness
Why can't you be more cynical?

I don't look the same in the photograph
I need to look the way I did in the photograph
By mentioning places it will all become clear
If we speak the same language, you're a deeper darker reason...

You shed a shade of shyness
You shed a shade of shyness
You shed a shade of shyness
Why can't you be more cynical?



It builds me up, it drags me down, and keeps me looking for some solid ground

Hai hai, hai hai, hai hai

The race is on, the stakes are high, they want your body better dance or die
The game is up, the die is cast, this roller-coaster may well be your last

Hai hai, hai hai, hai hai

If you want to know me, if you want to know me
Won't you love me like no body ever did before

The road is long, the climb is steep, and ghosts and goblins never seem to sleep
The storm has gone, the sky is clear
But there ain't no courage when there ain't no fear
So get away, oh get away

The sun goes up, the sun goes down, and this old world is still spinning around
It fills me up, it drags me down, and keeps me looking for some solid ground

Hai hai, hai hai, hai hai

If you want to know me, if you want to know me
Won't you love me like nobody ever did before'



Did not catch sight of you yet

Oh why
Is it so unkind?

Silver morning brings something to fight
Into the frame of its idiot night
It keeps me inside

I wait all my life
Just for the rush
The passing of fire
Into my blood

All the reasons that raced through my mind 
Just to keep me twisted and drowned
I leave them behind

Watch the people get tricked out of time
Every dream they had passing them by
It's freedom to find

I wait all my life
Just for the rush
The passing of fire
Into my blood

Wait all my life
Just for the rush 
The passing of fire into my blood
Into my blood

Burn the secrets I know the landslide
We'll always fall on the eclipse side
Tell me I've got no other way home
The way
I wait all my life
Just for the rush
The fear and the fight towards the inside
Into the light, ready to burn
I wait no more or hang on my turn
Move too slow, it's like waiting to die
To diffuse my mind
A dream less defined
Hands to the floor
This feeling is pure
They're shooting up love
Into my blood
Into my blood



Greed, money, useless children

Frightening lies from the other side
Power in the darkness
Stand up and fight for your rights
 
Freedom... we're talking bout your freedom
Freedom to choose what you do with your body
Freedom to believe what you like
Freedom for brothers to love one another
Freedom for black and white
Freedom from harassment, intimidation
Freedom for the mother and wife
Freedom from Big Brother's interrogation
Freedom to live your own life... I'm talking 'bout
 
Power in the darkness
Frightening lies from the other side
Power in the darkness
Stand up and fight for your rights
 
"Today, institutions fundamental to the British system of Government are under attack: the public schools, the house of Lords, the Church of England, the holy institution of Marriage, even our magnificent police force are no longer safe from those who would undermine our society, and it's about time we said 'enough is enough' and saw a return to the traditional British values of discipline, obedience, morality and freedom.
What we want is:
 
Freedom from the reds and the blacks and the criminals
Prostitutes, pansies and punks
Football hooligans, juvenile delinquents
Lesbians and left wing scum
Freedom from the niggers and the Pakis and the unions
Freedom from the Gipsies and the Jews
Freedom from leftwing layabouts and liberals
Freedom from the likes of you..."
 
Power in the darkness
Frightening lies from the other side
Power in the darkness
Stand up and fight for your rights



I trust the speed, I love the fear, the music comes, the burning spear



It could eat you up inside
Can you see the human spirit?
Tell me why should I have to hide

And with my heart in my hand
And with my hand upon my heart
And with my heart in my hand
It's not like we planned

Don't betray your lover
You will just betray yourself
Can you see the human spirit?
Is there emptiness inside?

And with my heart in my hand
And with my hand upon my heart
And with my heart in my hand
It's not like we planned

Can you see the human spirit?
Is there emptiness inside?
Can you see the human spirit?
Is there loneliness inside?

And with my heart in my hand
And with my hand upon my heart
And with my heart in my hand
It's not like we planned



Forgotten by the world
Forgotten to myself
Your effervescent eyes have awakened me
and brushed the dust away
But I knew you'd never stay

So I memorized the color of your eyes
As I lost myself inside you
And I memorized the way our legs entwined
As I drifted off beside you

I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside you

At night I cling to you
I'm so afraid
Afraid a day will come
And I'll wake and find you gone
But you promised that you'd not abandon me
And then kissed my fears away
But I woke up to that day

But I memorized the way our eyes would meet
Reflected in the bathroom mirror
And I memorized your naked silhouette
As you slowly brushed your hair

I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside you

I've been so alone for so long
Forgot how much it hurts
To wake up so alone

But I'd memorized how warm your body felt
As you lay half asleep beside me.
And I memorized the way the sunlight filled the room
And played upon your body

I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside you
I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside you



The sound that leads me home again
It sparks up the fire - a flame that still burns
To you I'll always return

I know the road is long
But where you are is home
Wherever you stay-I'll find the way
I'll run like the river-I'll follow the sun
I'll fly like an eagle
To where I belong

I can't stand the distance
I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you-yes I'm on my way home

Now I know it's true
My every road leads to you
And in the hour of darkness,
Your light gets me through

You run like the river-you shine like the sun
Yeah
You fly like an eagle-yeah you are the one
I seen every sunset and with all that I've learned
Oh, it's to you, I will always, always, return.



Straight up out of control
Full of words of wisdom
Seein double vision,
From a dead on head on
Crash course in collision
A sucker for a kind word
From every voice i've heard
This is my laso for you

There you go again bein beautiful you
Setting fire to all you hold on to
Theres a place in my head portraying
One side of you
I'm letting go again
Won't be another friend
To a beautiful, beautiful you

I'm a concept in the human race
A mere burnt image
Another shade of grays
Provoked by pride
Barely holdin on to life
A prejudice lover always in forever
Cause this is my answer for you

There you go again bein beautiful you
Setting fire to all you hold on to
Theres a place in my head portraying
One side of you
I'm letting go again
Won't be another friend
To a beautiful, beautiful you

I keep hearing what you said
It keeps playing over and over again

There you go again bein beautiful you
Setting fire to all you hold on to
Theres a place in my head portraying
One side of you
I'm letting go again
Won't be another friend
To a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful you



You try and learn it but you just don't know
Who's holding bullets for your twisted gun
You've spun it so that I may be the one

What will your wounded soldier spell
He's playing dead among the things that he will never tell
When will your wounded soul just see
That nothing here grows out of secrecy

You say you're never gonna be rich
Well how you ever gonna know
If you never open your eyelids
Tell me how you're gonna find gold
You're telling me you've never been kissed
Well maybe that's the way it goes
But if you never learn to take nothing
How you gonna learn to let go

You're moving on or are you running scared
It won't be long before the game gets fair
You sit in silence and you plead your case
You call it wisdom but they're just mistakes

They'll never need you back in Oregon
Can't build no story on the same old song
Giving up is such a bitter taste
I see the sour growing on your face

You say you're never gonna be rich
Well how you ever gonna know
If you never open your eyelids
Tell me how you're gonna find gold
You're telling me you've never been kissed
Well maybe that's the way it goes
But if you never learn to take nothing
How you gonna learn to let go

You say you're never gonna be rich
Well how you ever gonna know
If you never open your eyelids
Tell me how you're gonna find gold



As love is fading
From all the things that we are
And are not saying
Can we see beyond the scars
And make it to the dawn?

Change the colors of the sky
And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me 
All that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind 
Words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

The sun is breaking in your eyes
To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
As shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me 
All that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind 
Words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

Now that we're here
Now that we've come this far, just hold on
There is nothing to fear
For I am right beside you
For all my life I am yours

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me 
All that I was meant to be?
What if our love had never went away?
What if it's lost behind 
Words we could never find?

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me 
All that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind 
Words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
Baby, before it's too late
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?



Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go

She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged

Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm

Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else

Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way

She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home

I don't know what when or why
Now the twilight of love had arrived

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no, no harm, yeah

Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm

Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else



But they're my only option
Short of driving home
To try and calm my nerves of this unrest

Cause nothing's worse than a vacant town, yeah
Still looking for the answers that I haven't found
With each new fact I'm learning
My mind feels like it's turning away from you
So cut the ropes and let's go

Train, take me away
Anywhere but here
I've had it
I just can't stand it

I'm seeing how quiet I can say your name
I whisper to no one just to keep me sane
An echo in the dark I wish was you

If I only knew how to form a sound
To convince myself you'll come around
These memories are fading
But I'm getting sick of waiting to hear from you

Train, take me away
Anywhere but here
I've had it
I just can't stand it
Please, it makes me insane
Everyday I just can't stand it
I just can't stand it

Train, take me away
Anywhere but here
I've had it
I just can't stand it
Please, it makes me insane
Everyday I just can't stand it
I just can't stand it

Please, train, take me away
Please, train
I gotta get outta this town
Please, train
Been thinking 'bout it for too long



She's gone, gone, gone
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
Got my eyes wide open

Ever since I was on cripples Monday
Got my eyeballs on my knees
Aww my baby walkin' after hours with Mad Mary Williams
Said she never understood a word from me because

I know that she cares about me
I heard her call my name Heard her call my name
And I know that she's long dead and gone Heard her call my name
Still it ain't the same Heard her call my name

When I wake up in this morning, mama Heard her call my name
I heard her call my name Heard her call my name
I know that she's gone, gone, gone Heard her call my name
I heard her call my name and then my mind split open

Here she comes now, now
She's gone, gone, gone
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
Got my eyes wide open

Ever since I was on cripples Monday
Got my eyeballs on my knees
After hours with Mad Mary Williams
Said she never understood a word from me

I know that she cares about me
I heard her call my name Heard her call my name
And I said that she's long dead and gone Heard her call my name
Still she ain't the same Heard her call my name

When I woke up in the morning, mama Heard her call my name
I heard her call my name, no, no Heard her call my name
I know that she's gone, gone, gone Heard her call my name
Still I heard her call my name and then my mind split open



In the pools of water we drove by
in the ditch of the side of the road
On the way to the bridge where looking down just right
Oh it felt like we were moving

Then I caught the waves wrinkle the moon
And they kissed my body just beyond the shore
I talked you into a stone and skipped you across the water
But it was me who was really sinking

Lay me down
Down on the bottom
Come crashing over me
You'll be a dancer as I walk beside you

Then I saw the buildings leaning in
To touch heads where the yellow lines run
Looking down on the fool slowly walking
What did he feel like he was proving

Lay me down
Down on the bottom 
Come crasing over me
You'll be a dancer as I try to catch you



I get the same old sinking feeling
I think of a garden so still
I think of a cross upon a hill
And I think you know what I’m saying

So as these chords descend
So I shall follow them
They holler, catch me if you can
They holler, catch me, holler, catch me

Baby, I'm going down
Get your hands up off me, girl
I think I know my way around by now
They come to the party one by one
Until it's done, until it's done

My enemy
You must think you have the best of me
But you must know me to be vain
To leave this undone would be such a shame

So as these chords descend
So I shall follow them
They holler, catch me if you can
They holler, catch me, holler, catch me

Well, I will catch you by morning
My god, my god, my god

I'm going down
Get your hands up off me, girl
I think I know my way around by now
They come to the party one by one
Until it's done, until it's done

Baby, I'm going down
Get your hands up off me, girl
I think I know my way around by now
They come to the party one by one
Until it's done, until it's done

Until it's done
Until it's done
Until it's done
Until it's done



And I don't feel so bad I'd say
A second stops to look at me
Tips his hat and says "good day"

Then it's up and familiar, down and in flames
A light comes on and it entertains
Makes you feel, you could be
An overnight sensation
Your mood takes a swing at the ones you oppose
But the ones you love get a double dose
Swing away, swing away, swing away

One is jealous, two went out
Why I've told you is of doubt
If  you don't like what I may say
Please be kind and look away

Then it's up and familiar, down and in flames
A light comes on and it entertains
Makes you feel, you could be
An overnight sensation
Your mood takes a swing at the ones you oppose
But the ones you love get a double dose
Swing away, swing away, swing away

You've found an idea and it's lodged in your brain
A splinter of truth about the mess you've made 
Swing away, swing away, swing away



You don't know who I am when you're looking at me

Hang me tonight in the false and jaded light
In the center of the square, murder's breeding in the air
We're all innocent. The shadow's playing with our eyes

Sharpened tongues and the loaded guns of all the fortunate sons
You're the jack, back in black, ripping air from our lungs.

I'd cut my heart out of my chest and attach it to my sleeve
If I thought you'd think differently of me.



I won't be pushed around
The rules were set when we got started
But lately I have found
We've spent too little time and too much heartache
I feel we're losin' ground

And lately I've been hearin'
You won't be needin' me around

So don't leave me lonely
Just wanna be right by your side
Your one and only - tonite

Well don't leave me lonely
I need you here all the time
Don't leave me lonely - oh no

You say you need your independence
Well I need mine
Separate lives and separate feelings
Well, I guess that's fine
But that won't last - it's no solution
I know it can't survive

And lately I've been thinkin'
Thinkin' 'bout you all the time

Hey, don't leave me lonely
Just wanna be right by your side
Your one and only - tonite

Well don't leave me lonely
I need you here all the time
Don't leave me lonely, don't leave me lonely woh

Well don't leave me lonely
Just wanna be right by your side
Your one and only - tonite

Well don't leave me lonely
I need you here all the time
Don't leave me lonely - yeah yeah

Well don't leave me lonely
Just wanna be right by your side
Oh yeah
Don't leave me lonely, yeah



And I've been dying to let you win
It's all I wanna be
So won't you take it from me?
And I wonder
But the less I get the more I give
It's all I wanna be
So won't you take it from me?

I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes you see
I want someone to notice me

And I don't wanna be
Your new victim 

No regrets
Even if it's all I get
It's all I wanna be
So won't you take it from me?
And it still hurts
It's never easy to forget
Do I wanna be
What you never asked me?

I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes you see
I want you to notice me

And I don't wanna be
Your new victim 

I'm right here - x2

And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
So come and get me!
So come and get me!

And I don't wanna be
Your new victim 



For help with your endeavor

The simple understandings

Being like me

I believe what i see
Its hard i know
Agreein with me
When im seein and believin
I believe
If you were me
Then you'd see...



It's a cold fire, it's a cold fire

It was long after midnight
When we got to unconditional love
She said sure my heart is boundless
But don't push my limits too far

I said if love is so transcendent
I don't understand these boundaries
She said just don't disappoint me
You know how complex women are

I'll be around 
If you don't let me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't let me down

It was just before sunrise
When we started on traditional roles
She said sure I'll be your partner
But don't make too many demands

I said if love has these conditions
I don't understand those songs you love 
She said this is not a love song
This isn't fantasy land

Don't go too far
The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea
Is a cold fire
Don't cross the line
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor
Is a cold fire
Don't let me down
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond
Is a cold fire
Don't break the spell
The look in your eyes as you head for the door 
Is a cold fire

I'll be around
If you don't push me down too far
I'll be around 
If you don't push me down

I'll be around
If you don't push me down to far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down

Don't go too far
The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea
Is a cold fire
Don't cross the line
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor
Is a cold fire
Don't let me down
The flame at the heart of a pawnbrokers diamond
Is a cold fire
Don't break the spell
The look in your eyes as you head for the door 
Is a cold fire

I'll be around 
If you don't let me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't let me down

I'll be around
If you don't push me down to far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down
I'll be around
If you don't let me down

It's a cold fire
Love is blind if you are gentle
It's a cold fire
It's a cold fire
Love can turn to a long cold burn



Best to smile
Best to squeal for daddy
Best to revile
The baby Jesus loves the company

Must have lost my mind
When I lost the car keys
On my way out
How strange how you're not with me

Where has my head gone?
Where do you hole up
To mutilate the day away from me?
Where has my head gone?
Well I felt it slip away

Best to defile
Best to stay sleeping
In a while
I will awake to be a has been

Must have lost my mind
When I lost your heart key
On my way out
How strange how you're not with me

Where has my head gone?
Where do you hole up
To mutilate the day away from me?
Where has my head gone?
Well I felt it slip away



I feel so good I'm going to take someone apart tonight 
They put me in jail for my deviant ways 
Two years seven months and sixteen days 
Now I'm back on the street in a purple haze 

And I feel so good, and I feel so good 
Well I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart tonight 

I feel so good I'm going to make somebody's day tonight 
I feel so good I'm going to make somebody pay tonight 
I'm old enough to sin but I'm too young to vote 
Society's been dragging on the tail of my coat 
Now I've got a suitcase full of fifty pound notes 
And a half-naked woman with her tongue down my throat 

And I feel so good, and I feel so good 
Oh I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart tonight 

They made me pay for the things I've done 
Now it's my turn to have all the fun 
Well I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart tonight 

And I feel so good, I feel so good 
Well I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart tonight 
Oh Oh Oh 
I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart tonight 
Hm break somebody's heart 
Break somebody's heart 
Hm break somebody's heart 
Oh break somebody's heart



I tried, but me what could I do?
Get out the bad undo you head until you dont look like a junky,
Get out the bad undo your head think about what you say,
Kill The Band + Kill The Band
I was caught dreaming of wealth and,
I was taught was creeping in again,
They get ahead you get so mad,
Why do you care?
It's only money
Get out the bad undo your head think about what you say
Kill The Band, Kill The Band
Kill The Band, Kill The Band
If then it rains, I'll cover your eyes
The past has a way of running our lives

Learning to say the words that we hide
Kill The Band, Kill The Band

Kill The Band, Kill The Band
Pressure's coming,
I feel it coming down
Cancers coming, I feel it coming



A panic attack plan with no time to figure it out
We've issued a code red already dead
No open sign, no beak of light
That said:

Don't give it away
You want the truth
Its all answers now

All hands on deck we're going down
All hands on deck we're going down

Screaming, the end is near
So rest in peace cause we're the ones that put ourselves here
Water rises, now hold your breath and count down
This ship of sinners and saints are just waiting to drown

Don't give it away
You want the truth
Its all answers now

All hands on deck, we're going down
No plan but ours can take us now
So try to understand
Since we got lost and we get tossed around

All hands on deck we're going down

Aaaaaaaaaa
Aaaaaaaaaa

Of all the chaos and order there's no drift to catch the law of the unknown
So take refunds on your borders where
The truth is that we all must die alone

All hands on deck we're going down
No plan but ours can take us now
So try understand
Since we got lost and we get tossed around

All hands on deck we're going down



To spend the rest of our lives with each other
The rest of our days like two lovers
For ever
Yeah
For ever

My bijou



With a flame that burned so brightly in the sky
Then you woke up and your long white night was over
And you cursed the world that dared to pass you by

Now you blame the ones who love you for your sorrows
Dealing dirty while you steal the higher ground

But you cheated and you lied
And life took you for a ride
Now you're standing on the upside
Looking down

And O the hero in disguise
Believing his own alibis
You run so scared you're standing still
I know you are — I know you will

Be the first to call it quits and run for cover
While your little world is crumbling all around

But you punked out on yourself
You can't blame nobody else
Now that you're standing on the upside
Looking down

And O the heartache of the thief
Strung out on his own stash of grief
A line for you — a flake for me
But now it's ancient history

When the sky is turning black and glassing over
As you drift so high above the lights of town

All at once it seems so clear
You can see it all from here
When you're standing on the upside
Looking down



I am underwater
I can't stand to take the heat
And it's getting hotter
'Cause all that I
Am dying to hold onto
Is slowly digging me a grave
Gotta get away

Shake it off
Whenever I'm on the edge of giving in
Shake it off
'Cause nothing can keep me down when I'm living in
Love with You
So help me God to
Shake it off
Shake it off

I am under attack
And I've had enough
Of all these bricks on my back
So I'm letting go of
All the weight
That I've been holding onto
Turn to dust disintegrate
Get away

All this baggage I've kept around
Make it shatter on the ground
'Cause all that matters now
Is You!



With the worst of your days
You won't win
With your standards so high
And your spirits so low
At least remember...
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day

Just do your best and don't...
Don't worry, oh
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair

See the best of how they look
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win
With your standards so high
And your spirits so low
At least remember...
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress

Just do your best and don't...
Don't worry, oh
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair

Just do your best and don't...
Don't worry, oh
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair



Your eyes give you away
The gun in your hand still smoking
You don't have to take the blame
You have to do what you have to do
You know I'd never judge you
Still time to close those eyes, forget what happened, forget you lied

Put the mask back on, put the mask back on
Don't take it off till everybody's gone
Put the mask back on, put the mask back on
The disguise is everlasting so long

Cover up, cover up
Don't let them see the real you
If your secrets can't stay silent
All those rumors might just end up being true

You're free to do what you want
You never thought of consequence
You created your own little world 
Were you could always be different
A place were the rules do not apply
You could never be denied
You took advantage of a good thing
And now the void you build is empty

Put the mask back on, put the mask back on
Don't take it off till everybody's gone
Put the mask back on, put the mask back on
The disguise is everlasting so long

Cover up, cover up
Don't let them see the real you
If your secrets can't stay silent
All those rumors might just end up being true

Cover up, cover up
Don't question anything you do
You have always kept it quiet
But your conscience haunts you every time you choose

Has anyone ever reached out to you?
Has anyone ever seen your real face?
Does anyone know what you've been doing
As the one we used to know fades away

Cover up, cover up
Don't let them see the real you
If your secrets can't stay silent
All those rumors might just end up being true

Cover up, cover up
Don't question anything you do
You have always kept it quiet
But your conscience haunts you every time you choose

Cover up cover up, cover up, cover up - x4
