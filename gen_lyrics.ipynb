    "then, if that works out, we'll use this as a heuristic to select more coherent lyrics lines. \n",

    "concrete question though is how to do line-to-line generation. a basic procedure is to generate a line at a time (which seems to be what most systems are doing). then, when generating the next line, we need to generate a lot of candidates and then rank them and heuristically pick a semantically coherent yet not to similar line. \n",

    "1. stanford n-gram generator. they used tf-icf, which is particularly tuned to the input lyrics. at the first stage we don't take input lyrics into account. \n",

    "2. an interesting idea is the Japanese system where they used topic models to sample words, so they can cater to different topics. also there is an idea of using MIT professor's idea on promoting entity grid based coherence."
